Title: The Invention of Objectivity
 
Big media pundits are always wringing their hands about how upstart partisan bloggers are destroying the neutral objectivity our country was founded on. (If theres one thing pundits love to do, its hand-wringing.) Without major papers giving everyone an objective view of the facts, they insist, the very foundation of the republic is in peril.
 
You can criticize this view for just being silly or wrong, and many have, but theres another problem with it: its completely ahistorical. As Robert McChesney describes in The Problem of the Media, objectivity is a fairly recent invention  the republic was actually founded on partisan squabblers.
 
When our country was founded, newspapers were not neutral, non-partisan outlets, but the products of particular political parties. The Whigs had their paper, the Tories theirs, and both of which attacked their political opponents with slurs that would make even the most foul-mouthed bloggers blush. This behavior wasnt just permitted  it was encouraged.
 
You often hear the media quote Jeffersons comment that were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. However, they hesitate to print the following sentence: But I should mean that every man should receive those papers, and be capable of reading them. In particular, Jefferson was referring to the post office subsidy the government provided to the partisan press.
 
In 1794, newspapers made up 70% of post office traffic and the big debate in Congress was not over whether the government should pay for their delivery, but how much of it to pay for. James Madison attacked the idea that newspaper publishers should have to pay even a token fee to get the government to deliver their publications, calling it an insidious forerunner of something worse. By 1832, newspaper traffic had risen to make up 90% of all mail.
 
Indeed, objectivity wasnt even invented until the 1900s. Before that, McChesney comments, such notions for the press would have been nonsensical, even unthinkable. Everyone assumed that the best system of news was one where everyone could say their piece at very little cost. (The analogy to blogging isnt much of a stretch, now is it? See, James Madison loved blogs!)
 
But as wealth began to concentrate in the Gilded Age and the commercial presses began to lobby government for more favorable policies, the size and power of the smaller presses began to dwindle. The commercial presses were eager to be the only game in town, but they realized that if they were, their blatant partisanship would have to go. (Nobody would stand for a one-newspaper town if the one paper was blatantly biased.) So they decided to insist that journalism was a profession like any other, that reporting was an apolitical job, based solely on objective standards.
 
They set up schools of journalism to train reporters in the new notion. In 1900, there were no J-schools; by 1920, the major ones were going strong. The church and state separation of advertising and reporting became official doctrine and the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE) was set up to enforce it.
 
The entire foundation of press criticism was rebuilt. Now, instead of criticizing papers for the bias of their owners, press critics had to focus on the professional obligations of their writers. Bias wasnt about the slant of a papers focus, but about any slanting put in by a reporter.
 
So that was the line of attack the house press critics took when the world of weblogs brought back the vibrant political debates of our countrys founding. These guys are biased! Irresponsible! They get their facts wrong! Theyre unprofessional! they squeal. Look, guys. Tell that to James Madison.

I think the flaw here is imposing the social system of the past onto the present.
 
Objectivity is a bad way of thinking about it - I believe a better way is nonpartisan.
 
Let us be clear: A NON-PARTISAN PRESS IS A RECENT INVENTION!
 
Got it, heard it, got it, heard it, dont have to have it repeated uncounted times.
 
The question is whether destroying the nonpartisan model in favor of a partisan model is such a good idea. I have a deep mistrust of the motives of may of those who advocate this concept, and consider many of them (not you) extremely manipulative and deceptive.
 
Theres a lot of institutions invented in the past century, from Social Security to financial market regulation, where it could be said But wasnt like that in 1776! - and people using arguments of that type to attack them.

Not that I totally disagree with your reasoning, but Id like to see examples of media pundits who actually claim that objectivity dates back to the founding of the Republic. Any good media student - whether employed in media or not - knows that objectivity is a relatively recent phenomena.
 
In addition, there are towns even today where the paper is less than objective and proud of it: consider Manchesters Union-Leader in New Hampshire. And, I can think of several major J-schools that were not in existence in 1920 (the Univ. of Florida, for example).
 
None of this excuses any publication, whether paper or weblog, for getting the facts wrong. Hypocrisy (or ignorance) may be an accurate charge on occasion, but sometimes it really is about the facts.

A subjective statement from a a source with a stated bias is more valuable than a supposedly objective statement from a source with no stated biases.
 
We are all biased, this isnt necessarily a problem, but it may become a problem when a source claims objectivity.
 
The notion of balance in reporting is similarly dubious, as can be seen in attitudes to Capital punishment. You can be for or against it, but I dont see how you can adobt a balanced view.
 
Balance and Objectivity in reporting tend to actually support the status quo, taking the bite out of critical comment and dissembling on important issues which need action. They are tools which are employed to quiet debate not further it, stall action rather than support it and are employed by reactionary forces more than radical ones.

There is yet another way of looking at this (from an objective viewpoint).  As post-modern theorists have been suggesting for some time, there no longer is such a thing as ?objectivity? in our information age.  The problem is, we are now awash in a sea of information and opinions.  Not only are there an infinite number of them, but they can?t be escaped.  Consider something simple and fairly straightforward, for instance, like the shooting at Virginia Tech.  One view of the story is that this guy was insane and should never have been allowed to walk the streets.  One version was that the school?s hands were tied because of liberal laws that prevent locking people like this up.  Another version says if only the students had had handguns.  Another version says if only there were better guncontrol.  Another pundit blames the school?s technology.  Another says technology wouldn?t have helped.  Some suggest that the student was the victim of too much teasing by roommates and other students.  Which is right?  Ultimately they are all right, and they are all wrong.  TRUTH can no longer be pinned down because ? as a result of new media ? we?ve lost touch with reality in some fundamental way.  And it may always have been the case that papers could not avoid partisanship, but there?s something slightly different at work here.

The important question for me isnt how our present system came to be.  The important question is what the best system is, and how can we get there?
 
I firmly believe that its possible to become less biased.  It seems obvious to me that if people are less biased, then they are more likely to have opinions that are aligned with reality.  And that has to be a good thing, right?
 
Here is a political strategy for busy people: Change your position to fit that of the smartest, least biased, most trustworthy, and most informed person you know.  Statistically, I think youre much more likely to have opinions that are aligned with reality.  Imagine if 90% of the population did this, while 10% carefully, thoroughly, and objectively thought through political issues and advised the rest on how to vote.  I actually think the world would be a better place if we did this.  I mean, think about it.  Would you rather have a large number of people making badly informed decisions, or a small yet diverse group of people making well informed decisions?

Title: Science Summaries
 
Anybody whos ever read so much as a Malcolm Gladwell article or an Alfie Kohn book knows that science can be fascinating, that its attempts at answering our questions not only can have a real impact on our lives but are interesting in their own right. Wouldnt it be great if there was a place that reported these things?
 
If this exists, please tell me  Id love to read it. But if it doesnt, Id like to start one. Heres the idea:
 
We have a bunch of contributors, each of whom reads a variety of journals or journal summaries. When they come across an article that seems particularly interesting, they write up a one or two paragraph summary of the experiment and the findings aimed at an intelligent but generalist audience along with a link to the actual article.
 
So heres an example of what this might look like:
 
Economists at Cornell and Indiana University tried to see if television causes autism. Thinking that rainfall could cause kids to watch more TV and thus induce autism, they looked at county-level data in California, Oregon, and Washington  states with high variability in rainfall  and found that autism was was correlated with rainfall (R^2=.77). Thinking that the use of cable TV was another random variable that increased autism, they looked at similar data in California and Pennsylvania and found the use of cable TV correlated with autism (R^2=.21). [Paper]
 
(I probably screwed up the R^2 bit, but thats why Im looking for other people to write these.) Of course, this particular study got lots of media attention (thats why I knew about it), but Im hoping that with enough contributors well uncover interesting studies that dont make it into the general news.
 
So the contributors write a paragraph like this and send it in to an editor, who posts it to a blog, where people can subscribe and comment and so on like any other blog.
 
Im happy to set up the blog and serve as the initial editor, so what I really need are contributors. Do you read journals or other reports of new science? If so, either post here (be sure to include your email so I can contact you!) or email me@aaronsw.com with a list of the journals or news sources you read and would be willing to go thru.
 
Or, if you have comments on the idea, feel free to post those too.

Having a well classified river of abstracts is a good idea.  But what is missing in the media/Internet is a method of determining which propositions are true.  One way to do that would be to have reading groups which assembled a context about a particular proposition and delved into it sufficiently to come up with a finding.  It would be like an ad hoc commission.  Ive done a couple of these inquiries in http://fastblogit.com/tags/inquiry%20node but i seem to the the only person interested in pursuing a better truth.  The whole point of a reading group would be to extend the intelligence of the inquiry beyond the single brain pan that lies on one side of my reading glasses.

I read lots of science press releases and abstracts (and more rarely actual papers) and love talking about them, so this sounds like a good idea to me.  My brother reads Science magazine, which arrives every week, contains full peer-reviewed papers, and also contains lots of the kinds of news/interest/chat stuff  I mostly rely on him to read the good bit aloud to me.

This already exists: its called Science News.  You can see their website at http://sciencenews.org/ , but by far the preferred way to read it is to get the magazine.  Its weekly, and it routinely has three-or-so paragraph summaries of interesting and new research.  It also usually has 2 or 3 featured articles per issue, as well, which highlight some scientific research for 2 or 3 pages or so.
 
Im not sure if all of the articles are also put online (I imagine not, but maybe the featured articles are), but Id highly recommend subscribing to the magazine.  Its the only physical magazine that I find actually reports on relevant things in a timely manner.

The Medical Letter does this for doctors. It is wildly expensive, but has zero advertizing. This is also one of the economies of scale that doctors gain through group practice, and a major advantage of being in acadamia in general. Your new science subreddit is good; hopefully it will improve with usage (training?). I admit I was just thinking as I went through science.reddit that a much more valuable resource would be a reddit of journal articles. Maybe you could start a PubMed subreddit that cross-checks all new posts to verify they correlate with journals or books indexed in PubMed. Then we could post to Grand Rounds, other blog carnivals, and medical libraries to get the word out.

As can be seen in the replies above, there already exists a vast industry of science popularisers out there. I think what Aaron is really asking for, is science writing of the quality that someone like Malcolm Gladwell. Unfortunately, brilliant prose stylists like Gladwell come few and far in between. I mean, hes good enough to be a staff writer for the New Yorker. For starters, the research he does for his articles is incredibly extensive - what you see in the articles is only the tip of the iceberg. And the boy can write. You can tell by his absolute command of the judicious metaphor. He can pack more in a sentence than most writers in a paragraph. Funny enough, his articles follow a very classic essay structure - begin with a character anecdote, which leads into a fascinating problem, then discuss the researchers who solve the problem, and ends with a brilliant hook. Wish I had one for this comment.

I think there are two things lacking: contributors and schema, that is, the framework of knowledge within which any given science article fits in. Remember, journals are written for experts, by experts. These people already have schema, but even they only have schema for their chosen branch. I suspect folks reading this could compose HTML tables, including stylistic choices, in a text editor, but most readers are probably not to comfortable with which drugs have increased bioavailabilities and half-lifes in the body when digoxin is on board. Meanwhile, digoxin drug interactions are beaten into the heads of all medical students because theyre lethal, and, they might do well in a set of html tables, most docs couldnt tell you what html stands for.
 
Let us not go into the importance of the Hamiltonian in physics or affinity in chemistry.
 
Theyre all, however, major joints in the schema of the respective sciences, assumed pieces of knowledge within which the facts of any given article are written to fit. No schema, no place for the facts to fit. Whole metaphors will be completely missing.
 
Every once in a while a new idea grows up to become a major component of the schema. People tend to get prizes for these things and the work, while it may be first mentioned in a single paper, the signifance may not be instantly obvious. To wit, the mathematics behind CT earned the Nobel, but the work sat in a journal for a decade before an engineer arrived looking for the math that would guide his solution to what he saw as an engineering problem.
 
If you need expert contributors to screen new articles for people who arent experts in that field, then you face the same problem experts have faced for hundreds of years: sometimes, you just dont know if something is important until it is. Thats why libraries remain essential. Scientists need someplace to keep the thinking until someone goes looking for it.
 
If it is obvious that something is new, and big, then the editors usually pick up on that and make press releases.
 
Finally, sometimes there are articles that help guide the development of your schema, even though they arent particularly profound. These will stick in your mind, but no one really cares. Philip Greenspuns HTML primer is a great example, for me. Its such a beautiful little example of its own principles, sort of a Strunk and White of HTML, and probably a few other people treasure it like I do, but professional programmers dont need it and the vast majority of humanity doesnt know what HTML is.
 
Similarly, this article on sepsis came out in the New England Journal of Medicine yesterday, and may well become a schema-forming article for me (were studying this right now), but its not ground-breaking, and I doubt its going to capture the imagination.
 
So, I think the objective, while the problem may be easily stated,
 
it isnt nearly so simple in reality.

Title: Talking Right
 

 
Government, John Dewey famously said, is the shadow cast by big business over society. And political language, Geoffrey Nunberg argues in Talking Right, is the shadow cast by government. Democrats, he points out, seem to think language has a talismanic power, that if only they can find the right catch phrase or slogan, they can pull people over to their side. Liberal must become progressive, family values must become valuing families. Theres an intellectual cleverness to such stunts, and as a Berkeley linguist, Nunberg must want to believe in them. But he doesnt. The words, he explains, are just a side-effect of the larger political situation. Dewey explained that attempts to change the shadow will have no effect without a change in the substance, and Nunberg heartily agrees.
 
Its hard to see how it could be otherwise, but Democrats have suffered from a stubborn literalism in political discourse: thinking they can beat the charge of big government by launching programs cutting down on bureaucratic waste, thinking they can reclaim the issue of values by pointing to their love of tolerance and fairness, thinking they can dodge the charge of latte-sipping by donning a hunting cap and rifle. In reality, the issues go much deeper: big government is an attack on the notion that government can do good, values refers to a feeling of national morals run amok, and the latte-sipping charge is an attempt to distract voters from bigger issues of class. Nunberg even chastises his colleague George Lakoff for assuming that the current packages of political positions have any deeper meanings, rather than just being accidents of history.
 
Nunberg is an essayisthis commentaries for NPRs Fresh Air are a national treasureand his style, while eminently readable, doesnt translate well to a long book, where his points get lost in a field of anecdotes. But beneath all the stories about how conservatives eat more brie and liberal used to be a mantle claimed by everyone, Nunbergs point is a familiar one: if the Democrats want to win, they must begin telling full-throated populist stories about how the economic elite are capturing the wealth of our country and how we need government to take it back. The point is no less true for being popular, and its heartening to find that investigation from yet another perspective yields the same conclusions.

Whats Nunbergs argument against Lakoffs moral models?
 
posted by misuba
 on October 17, 2006 #
 
Amusingly, its an extremely technical argument phrased in very popular language. His end goal is to argue that theres no cognitive reason for the current set of issue correlations, that its just an accident of history that the culture war party is also the pro-business party.
 
He does this by arguing that Lakoffs model could be overfitted, that if the correlations went the other way around someone would come up with an equally nice story, even if human psychology stayed the same.
 
And he does this by arguing that Lakoffs methodology is suspect, that simply coming up with a metaphor that explains some evidence isnt science, that such claims need some test of validity.
 
Personally, Im skeptical that issue correlations are simply accidents of history. But his critique of the methodology is quite convincing; that kind of casualness isnt really appropriate for science. So while I dont think it defeats Lakoffs larger point, its easy to imagine one of his smaller claims made using the same methodology not being able to stand up to scrutiny.

Title: The Sexual Life of Savages
 
In the early 1900s, anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski did his field work in the Trobriand Islands of the Western Pacific. After getting himself ashore, he dropped himself into their culture and begun having to learn their language and understand their customs. The result were a series of groundbreaking books in the field of anthropology, much of which is still entertaining to read today.
 
In The Sexual Life of Savages (savages, Malinowski assures us, is a technical term and not meant to cause offense) he describes the customs of Trobriands intimate life, which is fascinating both for how it is different and how it is the same.
 
To a certain degree, it seems like the culture of the islanders presages our own. Back when Malinowski was doing his field work, he was amazed that islanders could freely have premarital sex and yet still found it desirable to get married. The same question would prove no puzzle to any American today.
 
And, indeed, the islanders seem like a case study in the ultimate consequences of the sexual revolution: girls want sex just as much as guys, kids start having sex at a very young age  6-8 for the girls and 10-12 for the guys  with no social stigma, there are few customs about dating to inhibit hooking up, and, of course, revealing clothing has been taken to its limit, with girls actually going topless.
 
Of course, much of the story of a Trobriands intimate life is the same: initial attractions budding into lasting relationships, etc. And then, out of nowhere, Malinowski drops in something totally bizarre. The islanders dont kiss, he explains. Instead, they scratch. The girls scratch the guys so hard that they draw blood and, if the guys can withstand the pain, then they move forward to having sex. The ethnographer (as Malinowski calls himself) verified this by noting that just about everyone on the island had noticeable scratches. And while everybody is having sex whenever they want, premarital meal-sharing is a big no-no. Youre not supposed to go out for dinner together until after you get married.
 
But the most fascinating and strange part about the islanders are their beliefs on the subject of pregnancy, also described in Malinowskis classic article Baloma: The Spirits of the Dead in the Trobriand Islands. When people die, you see, their spirit takes a canoe to the island of Tuma, which works very much like the normal island except everybody is a spirit of the dead. When the spirit gets old and wrinkled it shrugs off its skin and turns back into an embryo, which a spirit then takes back to the island and inserts into a woman. This, you see, is how women get pregnant.
 
Thats right. The islanders do not believe that sex causes pregnancy. They dont believe in physiological fatherhood. Malinowski was incredibly skeptical about this, so he tried all sorts of ways to see if this was simply a story they told, while they actually the real deal. But no, they assured him that it was really true, that all the white people who insisted otherwise were being silly, that the spirits caused pregnancy, not sex.
 
They argued the case quite logically. After all, they noted, one fellow went on an expedition for a year or two and when he came back, he had a new son. He obviously wasnt having sex with her while he was away, so where did the kid come from? (Cough.) And, they note, there are some really hideous people on the island who nobody would dare have sex with, yet they manage to become pregnant. (Malinowski spies some kids looking sheepish when this subject is raised.)
 
They also argue the other way: people on the island are having sex all the time from a very early age and yet they very rarely get pregnant. (Naturally, the islanders dont practice any form of contraception; the very idea doesnt make sense when sex doesnt cause pregnancy.) The white mans argument just doesnt make sense. Indeed, recent visitors report, the islanders still believe that sex doesnt cause pregnancy, despite the best efforts of health workers.
 
It is speculated that the yams that form the basis of the island diet have a contraceptive agent in them (The Pill was originally made by looking at chemicals in wild yams), which conveniently explains quite a bit, including the low birthrate despite the high level of sexual activity. Indeed, the whole idea lends quite a bit of support to the idea that material factors shape culture  after all, our own sexual revolution didnt happen until we got the yams chemicals in pill form in 1960.
 
The notion has some other interesting consequences. For example, the society is necessarily matrilineal, since fathers have no technical lineage. Yet sociological fathers (the mothers husband), Malinowski notes, show more love and care for their children than most hes seen in Europe.
 
Furthermore, they believe the same rules apply to the rest of the animal kingdom. This is what clinches it for Malinowski  despite all the effort they go to to raise pigs, they insist that pigs also reproduce asexually. They never attempt to breed pigs; indeed, they castrate all the male pigs they have. (To them this is further proof  we castrated all the pigs and yet they keep having children! Malinowski notes that the domestic pigs often sneak off to canoodle with those in the wild.)
 
When I told a friend of mine about this odd state of affairs, he wondered if the islanders were just stupid. After all, he noted, sex and childbirth arent exactly two physically unconnected human activities. But as he reflected on it further, he considered that this belief wasnt that much different from what passes for religion in our country. Smart people believe strange things.

From the article you link:
 
When American GIs were stationed here some 30 years later, they reported that the Trobrian islanders, for all their hospitality and charm, seemed to relish misleading foreigners. The few outsiders who had visited this remote paradise found themselves the butt of merciless teasing, practical jokes, and sexual harassment.

Its one thing to play this prank on an enthnographer; its another to not be mad at your wife for cheating on you. My understand is that those arent exactly feelings you can control, but even if you could, why would you hold them back just for the sake of playing a joke on an ethnographer?

The idea of mad at your wife for cheating on you is a monogamy cultural reaction. If they dont have the same sort of family system, they wont have the same sort of reaction. Moreover, if there is a reaction, its entirely possible its not something which will be displayed to the cultural outsider.

Id want to know more of the context. Remember, even in Western culture, not everyone reacts the same way to being cheated on.
 
The whole things too much of a fit with the myth of the ignorant savage, combined with taboos about sex, so an extreme amount of skepticism is warranted.
 
Sure, cultures have strange belief systems. But those are usually very complicated parts of how it all works, rather than the islanders were just stupid.

Anthropology is a tricky field, because different cultural norms and expectations of the anthropologist always to some degree color his interpretations of events.  Societies are extremely complex, and it is very difficult, even after years of living in a community, to really know how it works (even as an insider, but particularly looking in from the outside, as my parents, who have been working as anthropologists among the Maya of the highlands of Chiapas Mexico for over 30 years, well know).  As fields of study, anthropology, and particularly ethnography, have changed considerably in the past 100 years.  I agree with Seth that skepticism is warranted in this case.

You know, biology is a very hard field and your cultural norms and expectations always color your review of the evidence. Organisms are extremely complex and it is very difficult, even after years of study, to really know how they work. So presumably you agree with the Intelligent Design movement that skepticism is warranted in the case of evolution.
 
Its completely irresponsible to criticize science on platitudes; if youre serious you have to criticize it on facts. Seth tried, but he failed, because the facts were all against him and he hadnt done his homework. You didnt try at all.

Aaron, I did cite a passage in one of the very articles you linked to, talking about relish misleading foreigners.
 
Theres no way one can prove any of this in an absolute sense since it involves peoples mental states, which are not amenable to much objective testing - hence the analogy to biology isnt very good.
 
Actually, thinking about it, Id say that if theres a culture with open sexuality, and yet keeps telling you the equivalent of the stork brings babies, youve got something really interesting in terms of a taboo system - going down a path of no, no, they really really do believe in the stork, they say so, seems horrifically missing the point.

Sorry Aaron,
 
Im not suggesting that you or Malinowski is necessarily wrong.  When I say skepticism is warranted, I dont mean that you should necessarily believe or disbelieve these studies.  But the thing is, you cant really call cultural studies science in my opinion.  Its all based on interpretation, which is by necessity colored by the biases of the ethnographer.  I suppose I should give a more concrete example of what I mean.
 
The main focus of anthropology in southern Mexico before about 1970 was on ceremonial practice, and culture.  Patronizing studies were written about how quaint the religious practices were.  It was assumed that they had remained largely unchanged for hundreds of years.  It was noticed that the men were mostly drunkards, who beat their wives, and that the wives were the ones doing most of the work, etc.
 
The problem with this analysis was that it completely ignored the economic realities:  first, a large majority of the men spent 8-10 months/year working hundreds of miles away on coffee and sugar plantations, and coming back to their homes mainly for religious festivals, at which they all got roaringly drunk;  second, a large part of the economic strategy of rich land owners relied on getting men drunk on loaned alcohol, which debt they would later need to work off.
 
Now, the point of this story isnt necessarily that the original anthropologists were completely wrong, but rather that in any cultural examination, its very easy to miss (huge, gigantic) aspects of whats really going on.  Even after spending more than 30 years visiting the same Tzotzil Maya paraj, my parents complain on a daily basis about missing some words in a conversation, or missing the punchline of some joke, or not understanding whats really going on.  They feel foolish asking the same sorts of questions over and over, and having things explained to them that to our Maya friends, seem obvious.
 
So, go ahead and read Malinowski, and similar authors.  But read with a healthy dose of skepticism.

And this is just condescending bullshit :)
 
You know, biology is a very hard field and your cultural norms and expectations always color your review of the evidence. Organisms are extremely complex and it is very difficult, even after years of study, to really know how they work.

Seth: How is a mistaken belief a taboo system?

Aaron, the point is whether its a mistaken belief versus a taboo system. Claiming that theres no connection between sex and pregnancy is far more likely a cultural way of saying we-dont-talk-about-that, than what they really believe, and its far more culturally significant for that.
 
So if you go down the path of how could they believe such a strange thing, it misses the interesting aspect of why do they not want to admit a connection between sex and pregnancy.

So youre back to denying the truth of the claim. Heres my point about the pigs: the islanders used to trade five of their pigs for one European pig. But when they got the European pigs, they placed them with all their other pigs, so of course they interbred, which led to half-breed children, which they then traded again at a 5-to-1 ratio for more European pigs.
 
Does that seem like a taboo to you?

Incidentally, Malinowski notes some taboo side-effects of this belief. For example, its extremely taboo to suggest genetic resemblences between people. When he mentions that a boy resembles his brother, everyone gasps. Youre only allowed to say that people resemble their fathers.

No, thats not right.  My argument is that this is not a field where there is a right or wrong in nearly the same way as biology.  Its a matter of interpretation, and that interpretation is always colored by personal beliefs.  The reason that social analyses of this type arent a science is because they rely on analysis of patterns and anecdotes previously gathered, rather than controlled experimentation, and because their results are never clear-cut.  Saying that they arent a science is not meant to be a criticism of such analyses.  I think that anthropology and history can be very useful and insightful.  But they cant fairly be called science, in the same way as physics or biology.
 
This logic does not apply to controlled scientific experiments, where theories can be exhaustively tested, and shown to be good models of reality.  In biology, we can feed one rabbit carrots, and another cyanide, and see that the second rabbit dies, while the first one is fine.  We can repeat this experiment many times, with identical results.  Such is not the case with anthropology.
 
Maybe this is seems like an absurd distinction to you.  If so, I can probably explain it in greater detail.  It doesnt seem very hard to me though.

How is that any different from studying evolution? That field isnt exactly all about the controlled experiments.
 
To mangle a phrase, when someone tries to tell you that only X qualifies as science, be sure to hold on to your wallet (cf. Daubert, the British medical system).

Aaron, I have a feeling that unless I can explain a whole taboo system from a couple of offhand references, were going to go around it all again (No, no, theyre really do believe the stork brings babies! You havent proven they dont!).

Im not sure what you mean by the same, I was just pointing out that your argument applied equally well to both cases. And while I am using a terse argument style, I think this is an important point. The social sciences need to become more serious; saying that the task is impossible makes that tough.

I think youve hit on a bit of a point here, in that we should definitely be skeptical as well of biological investigation which uses anecdotal or statistical evidence rather than controlled experimentation.  But there is a continuum here.  At one end, we have mathematics, which can be proven from first principles.  At the other we have completely speculative fields.  Everything we study is somewhere in between.  Personally, lots of evolution research, and behavioral biological studies, etc., strike me as quite speculative.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as we recognize it for what it is.  Economics is even less controlled than most behavioral biology studies, and is tainted by political agendas and personal biases, which is why it is such a controversial subject.  Then cultural/social anthropology farther still along this continuum.  This is not a bad thing.  I dont have any particular problem with rich stories, with personal interpretations, or with looking at statistical trends.  These tools can all be very useful in coming to an understanding of the world.  But they should be recognized for what they are.  We shouldnt try to make ethnography into controlled experimentation (the so-called scientific method).  Its a fundamentally different approach, and should be recognized as such.
 
In other words, skepticism is always valuable, under all circumstances.  If I can show you a bevy of repeatable controlled experiments, which back up my model of the world, then you can begin to believe it.  If I instead show you some statistical analysis of the past, or tell you about my friend Joe, you should remain skeptical, you should think about my biases, and imagine the way that they color my methods and conclusions.  At the end of the day, you may decide that you agree with me or not, but even if analyses are convincing, that doesnt make it science, in the same way the controlled experiment is.

Interesting conversation. I just have a few side comments and questions.
 
Seth says: The idea of mad at your wife for cheating on you is a monogamy cultural reaction. Its not peculiar to monogamous societies, and I understand the tendency towards violent rage probably increases in polygamous societies. The idea being that dominant alpha males have to exert a great deal of control to keep their many women in line, and have more reason to be suspicious of the many sexually disenfranchised males running around who have nothing to lose. And of course he has little reason to value each woman, since from his point of view theyre interchangable and replaceable.
 
Aaron says: its extremely taboo to suggest genetic resemblences between people [e.g., brothers]. Youre only allowed to say that people resemble their fathers. This makes little sense if they dont believe sex leads to babies. Why the distinction? I think the tendency to note the resemblance of children to fathers serves to reinforce paternity. (Some recent study confirmed this; people tend to say that kids resembled their fathers no matter what they looked like.) If anything, this seems to bolster Seths interesting idea that their stated belief represents an underlying taboo system.
 
Aaron says: Theres some stuff he thought they were pulling his leg about, but everything else he tried to verify first-hand. I dont understand: did Malinowski identify any notable tendency for the Trobrianders to try to fool him? If so it would tend to support the GIs account.
 
Aaron says: So presumably you agree with the Intelligent Design movement that skepticism is warranted in the case of evolution. I agree with Jacobs criticism here, but would only add that this formulation is exactly backwards. When all your evidence supports the idea of evolution, it is outlying claims of Intelligent Design or Immaculate Conception that deserve the special scrutiny. What impresses me in this case is that despite wide variation in cultural practices (e.g., kissing vs. scratching), Im at a loss to think of any similar disagreement among cultures about a matter so fundamental as sex leading to babies.  That makes it an extreme outlier.  Maybe not impossible, but it undermines a lot of what I understand to be axiomatic among anthropologists.

Nope, its fathers:
 
When you inquire again why it is that people resemble their father, who is a stranger and has nothing to do with the formation of their body, they have a stereotyped answer: It coagulates the face of the child; for always he lies with her, they sit together.  One of my informants explained it to me more exactly, turing his open hands to me palm upwards: Put some soft mash (sesa) on it, and it will mould like the hand. In the same manner, the husband remains with the woman and the child is moulded.

Title: Blast from the Past
 
I was reorganizing some of my files when I came across this website, a proto-blog kind of thing I apparently made aroun 1999 (to judge from the content). There, too, I wrote a review of two books about our educational system, and it was interesting to look at how my writing style and views have changed.
 
While the writing style is certainly childish and poorly-edited, its not unreadable (certainly not as unreadable as some academic writers) and the content is still reasonably sophisticated (with a bit of rewriting, the content could have passed for a blog post last week). And the web design is not too bad either, all things considered.
 
So, for this weeks Sunday Bonus Post, heres an excerpt:
 
Teachers spend more time teaching students how to do research instead of teaching them research skills []. One project put on by teachers at the North Shore Country Day School [the school I attended at the time] asks students to rate the quality of life for different countries. The students were eager to get into a discussion of the most important factors in a measurement of quality of life and the proper way to compare radically different countries. However, the teachers required that the students make these decisions quickly so that more time could be spent on learning computer research skills. Students were also not allowed to use factors that could not be found on the Internet. With projects like this, time is taken away from exciting discussions and debates to spend more time using the computer.
 
One teacher assigned supplemental work for students to do on the computer. Isnt this just extraneous busywork? one astute student asked. Yes, the teacher replied, but it practices computer skills. Computer skills must be very important for students to learn. So many teachers and schools dedicate so much time to their learning  some schools even have classes dedicated to them. The computer is a tool, the schools explain, one that students must learn to use properly. However, a pencil is also a tool which must be used properly, yet how many schools have classes on the proper use of pencils? Students are expected to learn usage of such tools on their own or at a younger age. Yet the computer demands constant education and instruction on its usage. This instruction is far more than that demanded by any other tool.

Oh, neat, an archeological find. Nothing like it to quell any sense of making no progress.
 
As Alan Kay says, the computer is like the piano; A piano can help you express the music inside you, or, by poor instruction, it can crush your musical sense altogether. Computer teaching in schools is so misguided I wouldnt know where to start if I tried to explain how.
 
Unfortunately or fortunately, all my old works were lost in a disk crash (except for a few rather embarrassing mailing list posts, which you can google for if you want a glimpse into the mind of a child of pentecostal christians).

Title: Getting It Right
 
Theres an interesting little experiment you can do. If you have a classroom of kids and you give them a bunch of tasks they can work on of varying difficulty, the kids will pick the tasks that are just outside their level, that stretch them to do a little bit more. (This is, of course, if they arent getting graded on this. If theyre getting graded, theyll always pick the easy ones.)
 
When I first heard about this experiment, I just assumed it was because they were good kids. But now I think theres a different explanation. Its because doing this is fun.
 
Working on something thats too easy for you isnt enjoyable, its just mindless. (Theres a reason few people play 50K Racewalker.) But doing something thats too hard for you isnt fun either. Its just like trying to run through a wall: youre not going to succeed and youre not going to learn much from it. So, like Goldilocks, the kids pick the task thats just right.
 
But its not simply by default either. Theres something actively enjoyable in itself about learning to achieve more. (Ive come to call this the Kipper effect, after the novel Kippers Game which revolves around this idea.) Theres a definite high to achievement, the rush of accomplishment, just as theres a corresponding low when you fail.
 
Im looking for more research on this idea  and Id be very grateful if anyone could point me to it. What kinds of things trigger the Kipper effect? Does it wear off? etc.

Alan Kay wrote that he likes to challenge kids to write (type?) because its bit difficult thing to do. He wrote he basically sets that his basic setting (for Dynabook/Squeak) is - to challenge kids to do something bit more difficult or we humans are not innately equipped to do fluently or elegantly.
 
So there might be some papers or references he and his people (SmallTalkers,Squeakers?) can suggest - how to set hoops or hardles in front of kids - theyve been doing this for decadesthey also (almost?) say kids have more talents in science and math than parents or teachers. [I am not very clear about how they put these two different things in one.]
 
As you may know he is basically in the same camp? as Seymour Papert, who takes bit more looser articulations about kids talents or potentials and how our regular education systems are not matching. (and wasting so many kids)
 
I now think those IA people (Intelligence Augmentation) should have written a lot more about education settings and kids - in the modern world. They could have written a lot more as general analysis, findings, and criticisms or suggestions - about education. That could have cleared up many issues. By merely writing or talking as computer scientists, they kind of really didnt fill the lines they had to fill. There is still some time left - while they are alive - but I am not sure how much theyd come to succeed on popularizing their ideals and dreams - and softwares (and hardwares?).
 
On a different note, there is an very old Stanford book, History of Education, written by Cubberley? might be an interesing reference book to have around for your - seems - interest in education systems settings. Recently someone wrote a book about that book, but I havent checked up.
 
Michael Oakeshott?s book titled On Human Conduct has - pp350 or so around? (there are different editions probably) - a brief paragraphs about the origins of modern educations. (Its for Nations to build meritocraciesto beat each other up)
 
And Im still probably very clueless about the history of Universities - and kids in the West. When peer pressure thing came in, when drinking and drugs became common, who started to sell those things to kids, - or kids themselves started by themselves(because they are so happy being away from suburbs and parents?).

Title: Getting it Wrong
 
Anyone whos spent any time around little kids in school, or even read books about people who have, knows that theyre terrified of getting the answer wrong. Geez, you dont even need to hang around little kids. When youre out chatting with a bunch of people and you say something that shows you didnt know something, you look embarrassed. When youre playing a video game and not doing well, you try to come up with an excuse. People hate failing, so much so that theyre afraid to try.
 
Which is a problem, because failing is most of what we do, most of the time. The only way to stretch your abilities is to try to do things a little bit beyond them, which means youre going to fail some of the time. Even weirder are the competitive situations. If Im playing a game that relies solely on practice against someone whos practiced more than me, Im probably going to lose, no matter how good a person I am. Yet I still feel degraded when I do.
 
Anyone who wants to build a decent educational environment is going to need to solve this problem. And there seem to be two ways of doing it: try and fix the people so that they dont feel embarrassed at failing or try to fix the environment so that people dont fail. Which option to pick sometimes gets people into philopolitical debates (trying to improve kids self-esteem means they wont be able to handle the real world! preventing kids from experiencing failure is just childish coddling!), but for now lets just be concerned with what works.
 
Getting people to be OK with being wrong seems tough, if only because everybody I know has this problem to a greater or lesser degree. There are occasional exceptions  mavericks like Richard Feynman (why do you care what other people think?) often seem fearless, although its hard to gauge how much of that was staged  but these just seem random, with no patterns suggesting why.
 
It seems quite likely that a lot of the fear is induced by a goal-oriented educational system, obsessed with grades for work (A, B, C) and grades for students (1st, 2nd, 3rd). And perhaps the fear of being wrong you see in older people stems from having been through such experiences in childhood. If this is the case, then simply building a decent non-coercive environment for children will solve the problem, but that seems like too much to hope for.
 
Perhaps the solution is in, as some suggest, building self-esteem, so that when kids are wrong on one thing, they have other things to fall back on. I certainly see this process operating in my own mind: pff, sure they can beat me in Guitar Hero, but at least I can go back to writing blog entries. But self-esteem is like a cushion: it prevents the fall from being too damaging, but it doesnt prevent the fall.
 
The real piece, it would seem, is finding some way to detach a students actions from their worth. The reason failing hurts is because we think it reflects badly on us. I failed, therefore Im a failure. But if thats not the case, then theres nothing to feel hurt about.
 
Detaching a self from your actions might seem like a silly thing, but lots of different pieces of psychology point to it. Richard Layard, in his survey Happiness: Lessons from a New Science, notes that studies consistently find that people who are detached from their surroundings  whether through Buddhist meditation, Christian belief in God, or cognitive therapy  are happier people. All feelings of joy and even physical pain are observed to fluctuate, and we see ourselves as like a wave of the seawhere the sea is eternal and the wave is just its present form. (p. 191)
 
Similarly Alfie Kohn, who looks more specifically at the studies about children, finds that its essential for a childs mental health that parents communicate that they love their child for who they are, no matter what it is they do. This concept can lead to some nasty philosophical debates  what are people, if not collections of things done?  but the practical implications are clear. Children, indeed all people, need unconditional love and support to be able to survive in this world. Attachment parenting studies find that even infants are afraid to explore a room unless their mother is close by to support them, and the same findings have been found in monkeys.
 
The flip side is: how do we build educational institutions that discourage these ways of thinking. Obviously well want to get rid of competition as well as grades, but even so, as we saw with Mission Hill, kids are scared of failure.
 
While Im loathe to introduce more individualism into American schools, it seems clear that one solution is to have people do work on their own. Kids are embarrassed in front of the class, shy people get bullied in small groups, so all that really leaves is to do it on your own.
 
And this does seem effective. People seem more likely to ask stupid questions if they get to write them down on anonymous cards. When people fail in a video game, it only makes them want to try again right away so they can finally beat it. Apparently when nobody knows youre getting it wrong, its a lot easier to handle it. Maybe because you know it cant affect the way people see you.
 
Schools can also work to discourage this kind of conditional seeing by making it completely unimportant. Even Mission Hill, which ensured every classroom was mixed-age, still had a notion of age and clear requirements for graduating. What if school, instead of a bunch of activities you had to march through, was a bunch of activities students could pick and choose from. When people are no longer marching, its hard to be worried about your place in line.
 
But can we take the next step? Can schools not just see their students unconditionally, but actually encourage them to see themselves that way? Clearly we could teach everybody Buddhist meditation or something (which, studies apparently show, is effective), but even better would be if there was something in the structure of the school that encouraged this way of thinking.
 
Removing deadlines and requirements should help students live more fully in the moment. Providing basic care to every student should help them feel valued as people. Creating a safe and trusting environment should free them from having to keep track of how much they can trust everyone else. And, of course, all the same things would be positive in the larger society.
 
Too often, people think of schools as systems for building good people. Perhaps its time to think of them as places to let people be good.

I agree with you that the current system is a mess and that there are many things that could be done to make it better.  I too feel that theres much more room for self-directed study.  However, I dont think you understand why things are the way they are today.  Without some sort of grading system, people will often float by and not try to do anything.  If there are no deadlines and requirements, when will stuff get done?  I think there is scope for looser requirements, but Im not sure no requirements would work.  What does basic care to every student mean?  Are you talking about health care?  And this fantasy of a completely trusting environment, what does that have to do with anything?  School isnt just about some self-directed commune where you get to float around (in that way you sound like the purveyors of the innocence of childhood that you previously criticized in a book review), its about learning the skills that you will need in an increasingly complex world.  The current system does a horrible job at this (Why is nobody teaching statistics in high school?  This would be a much better use of time than geometry or calculus.) but substance-free visions of a safe and trusting environment [where no one has] to keep track of how much they can trust everyone else get nobody anywhere.

As to the question of whether grades and deadlines are needed to get people to exert themselves:
 
You might argue that people not exerting themselves naturally is a product of our system of grades and deadlines. I dont know whether this is true or not, but its appealing.
 
In my experience, being in school has certainly gotten me to exert myself much more, and in many more areas, than I had before. But this may have a lot to do with my background; Since I was home-schooled by uneducated simpletons, my personal experience isnt the best reference.
 
The above two points may be contradictory. Well see in the morning.
 
I think there are probably other things that can do a better job than grades and deadlines. Being around interesting, motivated people is the most exciting and inspiring thing I have experienced. The best hacking Ive ever done was in the week after Wikimania  not during, because I was busy and tired, but after, while the emotional impact lasted.

I briefly read what was written.  Good concepts, except everyone is leaving out a big part of the equation.  How many in todays society are in touch with their emotions and how many have no concept of having any emotions at all?  People do incredible things because they are learning as they go along and it feels good upon completion.
 
Now, think about how many times things purposely go heywired in the world because of those that cant feel their emotions and hence cant feel accomplishments?

Title: iz r childrens lrnng?
 
High School Confidential
by Jeremy Iversen
Atria, 464 pp., $25.00
 
My Freshman Year: What a Professor Learned by Becoming a Student
by Rebekah Nathan
Penguin, 208 pp., $14.00 (paper reprint)
 
Some of our most formative years are spent in schools, odd places whose ostensible goal is adult-directed education but in reality are controlled by student-culture peer groups of which adults have little actual understanding. Adults run examinations and programs, try to be hip to teen culture, but ultimately, we must admit, we have little idea what really goes on, making it easy for rumors to run wild.
 
Jeremy Iversen and Rebekah Nathan decided to see for themselves what school life was really like, by going undercover and experiencing it themselves. While they went to different places, in different guises, in entirely different situations (Iversen was a senior in high school, while Nathan was a freshman in college), the pictures they draw are startlingly similar: a world where genuine education is absolutely the last thing on everyones mind.
 
Jeremy Iversen grew up in New York, attended a prestigious boarding school, and went to college at Stanford. But, he says, life after school didnt have the same appeal. So he decided to go back and get the typical high school education he never had. The result  High School Confidential  is a gripping memoir of what life is actually like for the cool kids in a southern California high school.
 
The general outlines are perhaps less than shocking to those who have been paying attention. High school kids routinely have casual sex with each other, for example. (Theres nothing else to do in this town, one student comments, except start drama with everybody.) They take drugs  marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, speed  right under their parents noses. (In one scene, Travis, the classs drug dealer, and Alexis, his sister, are confronted by their father. Im going to give you a drug test, he warns them. But Ive been clean since nursery! Travis replies. Oh, its only your sister Im worried about, explains the father.) The kids cheat, not just by copying on tests, but by taking copious steroids and human growth hormone to compete in sports. (I read an article about high school steroid use in Sports Illustrated, comments the team coach, as the kids who are using look away. Good thing thats not a problem in our school.)
 
Despite living in a very diverse community, many of the kids are full of casual racism and right-wing politics (white people need to stand up for their heritage, nuke all the Arabs), although theyre far more liberal in practice (doing drugs with their Middle Eastern friends). When they get mad at each other, they arent afraid to take it out in violent brawls. And when the school throws parties, everybody gets totally hammered. (Theres a brilliant scene where some kids throw up on Richard Nixons grave.)
 
However, the novel is gripping in its details, with more amusing characters and fascinating stories than any television show imitation of high school life. The teachers are such characters that were this fiction you might accuse them of being overwritten. School events are so lavish (a band performs every day at lunch, large coordinated dance-and-light shows are done for spirit rallies) that they seem like TV exaggerations. School assignments are so inane (cut apart this cat) that you might think the kid telling you this was exaggerating. But Iversen was there, the dialogue in the book is copied down verbatim, the description of events was taken first-hand.1
 
And, indeed, the most shocking components are not the tales of the kids, but of the schools. Iversen draws a picture of an institution that is not just failing at learning, but antithetical to it. Thea, the only girl in the book with any academic passion, is routinely discouraged by the actions of both peers and adults. But no other student even gets that far. The schools student culture makes caring about class unthinkable; the schools classes make learning near-impossible.
 
But the grandest component of Iversens tale is how he dismantles our previous methods for trying to understand how schools operate. First, there is Derrick, the school boards secret weapon. Derrick is an articulate and popular student, admired by all, and elected class president. But it slowly becomes clear that student government, including him, is nothing but the administrations pawn. The regulations are designed to make genuine complaints impossible to bring before the administration, while the administration uses Derrick at every opportunity as a mouthpiece for their lies about what the children really think. Thus the only student representative most outside adults see is no representative at all.
 
Then there are the standards regulations, around which the curriculum is supposedly organized. The state school accreditation team is coming to verify that it is, and the adults worry that theyre quite likely to fail. So the principal goes all-out, bribing, threatening, and faking the school into appearing good. Any kid who ever caused a problem is locked away in a hidden trailer for the duration of the inspectors visit, every class is replaced with fake, scripted, standards-compliant material. Every child puts on fake happy faces under severe duress. And the school passes with flying colors. I wish every kid in the state could have an education this good, insists the lead inspector.
 
The reality is that between adult and student, there is a vast gulf in mentality. Iversens genius is that he can get us inside the heads of both sides.
 
Around the same time, Rebekah Nathan, an anthropology professor at AnyU (both psuedonyms), was sitting in on some classes herself. She noticed that simply by acting like a student  sitting in class, taking notes, etc.  her fellow students began treating her like one, sharing gossip and trading facts she never got to see as a professor. Eager to cross that same mental gulf, she decided to spend her sabbatical the following year doing an undercover anthropological study of her own university.
 
Nathan enrolled as a freshman, lived in a dorm, and took a full load of courses. Despite looking like a mom, the other students accepted her as their own. She probably couldnt get involved in the party scene and didnt try  she stuck to studying the academic and intellectual side of college life  but pretty much everything she says fits with my impressions as a freshman Stanford student around the same time and I can even confirm a couple of her more surprising specific points.
 
After confining her focus to the intellectual, Nathan discovers that there simply isnt much there. Students have their own culture with regard to class, a language known as Undergraduate Cynical, where actually caring about the material is deeply frowned upon, and the only questions youre permitted to ask of a teacher are about the details of grading and assignments:
 
A good question, I learned, is one that voices a concern shared by other students or that asks for clarifications of upcoming work. Will there be more questions on the test from the text or the lecture? Should the paper be double- or single- spaced? []
 
[] What does that mean? is, incredibly, just not the kind of question that an American college student would ask.
 
This isnt just show; students genuinely arent engaged in classes. They dont do the required reading, they dash off assignments, they ditch classes, they cheat on tests. Some go up and talk to the teacher about things, but they do so with ulterior motives in mind. Signs and talks geared to incoming students explain that one must work the teachers by talking to them, getting them to recognize you so they will give you hints about tests and go easy on you when you need exceptions. I take the information I need from the professor, one highly-successful student tells Nathan, explaining what that consists of: how theyre going to grade you and what they think is important. Everything is seen as part of the game, not worthwhile for its own sake.
 
But its all too easy to lament this sad state of student affairs, perhaps complain about the laziness of modern students. But Nathan goes one step further: she shows why it is happening. For even she, a professor with a Ph.D, finds herself doing the exact same things. We dont need to study those things, they wont be on the test, she tells her study partner Rob. It takes Rob, a fellow student, to ask her whether she just cares about learning for its own sake.
 
The culture of Undergraduate Cynical, you see, is not created by student laziness or a lack of concern for intellectual life. Its created by the necessities of the schedule. Students simply dont have time to care. They take three to five classes, each with separate sections and lab assignments, each with its own schedule of papers and readings and adults to suck up to. That alone is enough to drive Rebekah crazy, despite her thinking she had pretty good time management skills juggling all her commitments as a professor. But on top of that most students go to activities and clubs, work an on- or off-campus job, party in the evenings, and try to maintain relationships. When you run the math, there just isnt enough time to care.
 
So students instead focus on doing whats required of them: just scraping by. Anything that wont impact their grade much is tossed and a desire to learn becomes a desire to pass. Its hard to imagine any sincere desire to learn surviving such a harried schedule. As soon as you get engrossed or a book or topic, you have to dash off to your next meeting.
 
Again, this is all something completely invisible to the professors. They spend their days worrying about tomorrows lecture and are shocked when students dont do the same. But the students havent had time: theyve had two more classes and who knows how many assignments in the interim. And, anyway, they only picked this course because it filled a convenient hole in their schedule, theyre not even sure what its about.
 
So the students simply dont get engrossed, student discussion groups dont actually discuss things, but instead each student simply makes up a point of view and shares it so they dont get a zero on their in-class participation grade. There is no meeting of the minds on any subject; there are hardly any minds.
 
Both books, their research being conducted undercover, will no doubt lead some to raise ethical questions. Jeremy Iversen had to deceive and mislead his fellow students  including creating a fake backstory  in order to experience life with them. Rebekah Nathan, while not explicitly lying, led students to believe she was just an older woman going back to school, and certainly not one of their professors.
 
But deception alone is not an ethical violation. Psychology studies routinely deceive subjects into thinking the experiment is about X, when actually it is about Y. (I myself have been so deceived.) The key difference, and in my opinion the only possible ethical lapse on Iversen and Nathans part, is that after the study is over, the psychologists explain what was really going on. Neither Nathan nor Iversen told their friends afterwards, leaving them only to discover it after the project had gone public.
 
(By contrast, Barbara Ehrenreich, in Nickeled and Dimed, her study of low-wage work, told her fellow workers at the end that she was working on a book about the experience. They were remarkably blas about it, she found.)
 
But more generally, important scientific projects like these might have to step on a few ethical toes. Some of the greatest experiments in psychology  the Milgram experiments on obedience to authority and Zimbardos Stanford Prison Experiment  were easy fodder for armchair ethicists. But while people may have their feelings ruffled, in all of these experiments there was little lasting hurt to the participants, while the educational consequences of the studies themselves have been immense.
 
The real ethical question is how we can justify forcing our children into such institutions of anti-intellectualism. Iversen found that high school students were quite conservative politically, even more so than their parents, and perhaps its not surprising that Bushs anti-intellectual charm appeals to kids who daily experience education as a form of torture.
 
Perhaps students learn something by going through the necessary motions required to get a degree, but I defy anyone to read both of these accounts and continue to insist that schools are teaching kids to be critical thinkers with a life-long love of learning. If anything, the real education is in the opposite.
 
Instead of critical thinkers, we have kids willing to accept any requirement, no matter how absurd, without question. If you write what you want to that prof, explains a successful senior, youre gonna end up with a bad grade. Whereas, if you write to them, you winyou can still have your own mindset and say, hell, I know this isnt the way I feel, but Ill give them what they want. But, as experiments in cognitive dissonance have shown us, if one continues saying what one doesnt feel, one begins feeling it before too long. Its easy to see how this is effective training for professionalism, which actually means doing what youre told, despite what you believe. But its hard to see how this system is going to generate students who will buck a trend.
 
Instead of life-long learners, we have kids who learn that genuine learning is a joke. Education becomes that stupid thing in classrooms that you have to do to get a decent job, an entirely mercenary perspective thats unhelpfully encouraged by the mercenary pressures of student loans. If the only education youve ever experienced is doing whats necessary to get a good grade, why would you do it when the grades werent around?
 
Our public high schools were supposed to make every child a good citizen of the democracy. Our great universities were supposed to show young people our grandest achievements. One could say that these institutions are failing at their jobs, but it might be more accurate to say that theyre being all too successful.
 
Notes
 
Some of the more verbal students at the school, upset at being hoodwinked by an undercover writer and disappointed at their portrayal, have taken to posting nasty comments on web sites and in the school paper suggesting that Iversens book is fictionalized. But, as far as I can see, everything they claim that he left out, he actually included (with a single exception: one person on the Internet claimed kids called him Plasticface) and they have failed to dispute any details he included. So, while no doubt Iversens book contains errors (every book does, especially one as difficult to write as this), Im compelled to believe it is largely accurate.

Bwahahahah!
 
Aaron, Im disappointed in your gullibility.
 
The guy Iverson went undercover at my high school, Claremont High School in Claremont CA.  His book is a load of bullshit, and Im amazed that anyone finds it believable.  You should read a more skeptical (which in this case implies reasonable) review in the LA Times, or b better still, check out the CHS Wolfpackets reporting
 
Iverson, a guy in his mid twenties, came in pretending to be just a dumb student (how many 24 year-old high school students do you know?).  He didnt do any of the homework that was assigned in any classes, including when he was assigned to groups working on substantial projects.  Then he asked everyone he could find what kind of drugs they did, what parties they were throwing on the weekend, and whether the endless sex they were having was all they expected.  Its kind of unsurprising that the other students figured out something was fishy (Most decided he was a Narc), and decided to lead him on.
 
The real scandal you are missing if you only read Iversons book, is the local shock at finding out this random adult was allowed to attend classes for an extended period without anyone knowing about it.  The [school district][cusd]s new superintendent, a standardized testing nut (Id call her an education Nazi), was the only person Iverson could find to let him into a public high school for his project.  Amazingly, the superintendent didnt tell anyone else about this, including the principal or other administrators at the high school.
 

 
Anyway, statements like these:
 
And, indeed, the most shocking components are not the tales of the kids, but of the schools. Iversen draws a picture of an institution that is not just failing at learning, but antithetical to it. Thea, the only girl in the book with any academic passion, is routinely discouraged by the actions of both peers and adults. But no other student even gets that far. The schools student culture makes caring about class unthinkable; the schools classes make learning near-impossible.
 
Just honestly have nothing to do with reality, and though I havent read Iversons book myself, I can tell you with great certainty that this derrick character you speak of:
 
The regulations are designed to make genuine complaints impossible to bring before the administration, while the administration uses Derrick at every opportunity as a mouthpiece for their lies about what the children really think. Thus the only student representative most outside adults see is no representative at all.
 
Is just made up, and though the school did indeed do some absurd things before the accreditation (e.g. for the first time ever all of the bathroom soap dispensers actually had soap!), and though the school administrators did indeed make sure to tell us all ad nauseam about how important it was that we looked sharp, this is just fantasy:
 
Any kid who ever caused a problem is locked away in a hidden trailer for the duration of the inspectors visit, every class is replaced with fake, scripted, standards-compliant material. Every child puts on fake happy faces under severe duress.
 
Most of all, however, Im quite disappointed in this statement in your footnote:
 
Some of the more verbal students at the school, upset at being hoodwinked by an undercover writer and disappointed at their portrayal, have taken to posting nasty comments on web sites and in the school paper suggesting that Iversens book is fictionalized.
 
Most of said verbal students are friends of mine, and to suggest that they are posting nasty comments out of some sort of disappointment and shame at the grand truth being revealed, is just ludicrous.  Indeed we should all be upset at being hoodwinked: you Aaron just as much as any of the students at CHS.

Whoops.  I guess I messed up my link for narc in the above comment.
 
While Im posting again, I might as well add that cognitive dissonance:
 
But, as experiments in cognitive dissonance have shown us, if one continues saying what one doesnt feel, one begins feeling it before too long. Its easy to see how this is effective training for professionalism, which actually means doing what youre told, despite what you believe. But its hard to see how this system is going to generate students who will buck a trend.
 
is alive and well in all of us.  Despite a story that seems quite unbelievable if youve ever been to any public high school, you swallowed it whole, without pausing to consider that though it may advance the agenda youve recently been pushing (all organized education is bad, &c.), it could also just be made up.  Buck the trend, Aaron.  Buck the trend. :)

I read all the articles you cite and addressed them in my footnote; theyre entirely unconvincing. If you have a specific dispute with the book, Id like to hear it, but these angry insults seem like exactly the kind of being upset that I referred to.

Well, I dont really have much interest in reading the book (I can get quite an idea of its flavor from your review, and from the comments of those I trust who did take the time to read it), but I can tell you that nothing you describe has anything to do with my personal experience.  The specific disputes are the following:
 
The characters described, for instance, the class president,
are either entirely fictional, or completely exaggerated from
their real-life inspirations.
 
The culture of the school described has very little
in common with my personal experience.
 
The implication that all the teachers are such characters
or are somehow crazy is way overblown.  Most of my teachers
at CHS were extremely dedicated to their students, and sure,
while not every assignment is the most amazing thing ever,
its impossible to say that they actively discouraged learning
 
The suggestion that The schools student culture makes caring
about class unthinkable; the schools classes make learning
near-impossible. is equally silly.  Claremont, in the same
small city with 5 small liberal arts colleges, is filled to
the brim with the children of academics and intellectuals.
 
But its hardly surprising that a 24 year-old, trying to act
like a dunce, whose main interactions with most students
involved him asking them which drugs he could get, and what
parties to go to, who never spent any time hanging out with
the more academically-minded students, never saw that side
of things.
 
The claim that Claremont is full of racism and right-wing
politics is quite exaggerated.  For the most part, students
are sadly rather disinterested in politics (this is true
all over the country).  But Claremont is probably the most
ethnically diverse community Ive ever been in (certainly
far more diverse than Cambridge), and everyone gets along
exceedingly well.  My friends came from all over the
world, and the amount of racial stigma in Claremont is
arguably less than just about anywhere else in the world.
 
Sure, students can form ethnic cliques, sticking together
through shared culture, language, and values.  But this
happens everywhere Ive ever been or heard about.
 
It is truly clear that in this case, The reality is that between adult and student, there is a vast gulf in mentality.  Mr. Iverson was unable to appreciate the student mentality, because he came in with some preconceived notion of what he wanted to write about, and arranged his stay in such a way that his evidence backed up that thesis.  I dont know a single student who would characterize Claremont High School in the way that Mr. Iverson does.  Not one.
 
Now Aaron, you are welcome to dismiss the opinions of everyone in the communitystudents, parents, teachers, and administratorsinstead believing the tripe fed you by one sensationalist Stanford grad, trying to sell his book.  You are welcome to imply that I, or Ellie Wolf, or anyone you like, is being disingenuous.  I cant stop you from believing whatever you want.  But to suggest that Mr. Iverson was in any way scientific; to compare his experience and conclusions to famous psychology studies; and to pretend that it supports your thesis that public education is broken beyond repair: thats just silly.
 
I hope I dont sound upset in all this rambling.  That isnt at all the tone in which I write my comments, which is much more one of amusement.  If I was funnier, I would crack some jokes, but instead, Ive tried to stick to rational argument.
 
I challenge you however to be more skeptical.  If you have no evidence beyond Mr. Iversons book itself, you should stop and ponder, before making sweeping generalizations about either the particular high school described, or the education system in general.  And if you truly feel insulted by my comments, Im quite sorry.  You have been taken in by a harlequin, but we all succumb to our preconceptions sometimes.  I mean no disrespect.

Hi, Aaron 
 
You were thoroughly, one-hundred percent, and completely right to support Jeremy Iversens HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL.
 
Im writing in response to Jacob Russ pseudo-critique.  Im writing anonymously, because, let us say, I have an intimate knowledge of this project, and I have legal concerns that severely tie my hands publically.  But Im sick of this utter Claremont BS, and its time to respond.
 
First of all, Rus, CHS 04, never actually read the book.  This guy is actually trying to critique something he never even read.  That should say it all, now shouldnt it?
 
Second, none of the people from CHS who shared their oh-so-valuable negative opinions on this project either a) ever read the book, or b) ever met Jeremy.  This is an utter and verifiable fact.  Include Ellie Wolf, include Trilo Kidambi, include the other two or three posters.
 
The genesis of their lie is as such:  Jeremy announced on national TV he had gone back to HS undercover.  A handful of shocked CHS students writing an editorial for the school paper claimed that students (never precisely identified) had made up drugs and sex, and in fact none such existed.
 
This then became the party line to such an extent that students in subsequent years had no actual clue what really happened, and just repeated it ad infinitum ad nauseum.
 
Of the media quotes, Joe Kelly was the only person who actually met Jeremy and actually read the book, and he supported it totally.
 
So its kind of silly to discuss a book with someone who never actually read it, like Rus, but here we go anyway.
 
didnt do any of the homework that was assigned in any classes
 
Lie.  Jeremy has a box filled with all the work he did.  He maintained a C+/B- average in every class.  He got a B in third-year second-semester French, which is shocking and sad for the school considering he never took a day of French before in his life.
 
including when he was assigned to groups working on substantial projects
 
Lie.  Ask Val Sedig in English class, Alyssa Deville in bio class, Ken Shinozaki in video class, or anybodysaywho actually worked with him on a group project.
 
Then he asked everyone he could find what kind of drugs they did
 
Lie.  Point to one person.  I want a name.
 
what parties they were throwing on the weekend
 
Lie.  He was simply invited.  Unlike you, Rus.
 
and whether the endless sex they were having was all they expected.
 
Lie.  Oh, come on.  Like anyone would actually say that.  Name a name.
 
Its kind of unsurprising that the other students figured out something was fishy (Most decided he was a [Narc]), and decided to lead him on.
 
Lie.  Who?  Who led Jeremy on?  Name a name.    As if a 24-year-old Phi Beta Kappa Stanford graduate had been so abysmally stupid as to be tricked by a band of giggling 15-year-olds.  The two weeks of attempts to trick and narcdom are humorously chronicled in the book.
 
I can tell you with great certainty that this derrick character you speak of is just made up.  The characters described, for instance, the class president, are either entirely fictional, or completely exaggerated from their real-life inspirations.
 
Well, Jacob, youre either totally ignorant or just lying.  Any way you slice it, youre dead wrong.  Derrick equals Billy Geiger plus Alex Reike plus Otis Holt IV.  Point to a single thing Derrick says or does, and I will tell you on precisely which day of which month and which hour Geiger, Reike, or Otis said or did that thing.
 
The implication that all the teachers are such characters or are somehow crazy is way overblown. Most of my teachers at CHS were extremely dedicated to their students, and sure, while not every assignment is the most amazing thing ever, its impossible to say that they actively discouraged learning
 
Rus, you poor naive Ivy Leaguer, you really didnt know what was going on in your own school, did you?  You took what we like to call AP classes, which at CHS consist of 45 seniors out of a class of 558.  Thats 8%.  Those are the classes where the teachers and students actually care.  Thats all you know.
 
What about the other 92%?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Mainstream America.  Thats what the books about.  Again, of course, its ludicrously easy to say precisely which CHS teacher said or did which thing on which day in which class period.  Call it out, Rus.  Point to a single quote, a single incident, and the hard evidence will answer you, stripping away all the protections in place to shield identities.
 
Is it Ms. Evans getting asked to prom?  Mr. Gorule screaming and beating his desk?  Mr. Walker molesting girls?  You get to decide what dirty laundry gets aired, Rus.  Its all on your head.
 
The claim that Claremont is full of racism and right-wing politics is quite exaggerated.
 
Lie.  Its not a claim, winner, its just a transcription of first-period government class.  Point to a single quote, and Ill tell you the day and precisely who said it.
 
Yeah, Rus, not AP Government class.  Government class.
 
But Claremont is probably the most ethnically diverse community Ive ever been in and everyone gets along exceedingly well
 
To quote you, Rus, Bwahahahah!  If you actually believe this about your community, its just sad.  Just open up the newspaper.
 
main interactions with most students involved him asking them which drugs he could get, and what parties to go to
 
This is throughly untrue, and you should know far better than this, Jacob.  Dont just repeat Ellie Wolf.  Find a single person who Jeremy asked what drugs he could get.  Oh, wait, oh, you cant?  Then shut the hell up.
 
In fact, Rus, you make a cameo on page 238.  You were the tall, gangly senior with pants too short wearing the Yale sweatshirt that all the girls laugh at.  Of course, we know it was actually your Harvard sweatshirt you dragged to school everyday.  Oh, gosh, maybe anonymity was nice, huh?  Maybe that doesnt make anything untrue, maybe it, gasp, protects people?
 
The only harlequin here is Jacob Rus and any of his lying, self-deluded, ignorant ilk.  You go, Math Pimp!
 

 
Rus, I dare you to read the whole thing and say what isnt true.  Bring it, kid.  You can be the one who reveals the true identities of your classmates and teachers for the entire world to see.
 
Until that point, until you even marginally inform yourself instead of regurgitating total libelous drivel, please be so good as to shut the hell up and leave Aaron alone.
 
And Iversen is spelled with an e.  I guess that says a lot about your rigor and accuracy.  :-)

Dear Mr. Anonymous,
 
I am sorry that I have obviously touched a nerve.  Indeed, you are correct, that I had no direct contact with Mr. Iversen (thank you for the spelling correction: no wonder I wasnt getting any google results before), and in fact, dont even really know the students who did.  Therefore, my comments about what transpired are drawn from students quoted in the press after-the-fact, including for instance the LA Times column Creepy Times at Claremont High linked earlier, and from hearsay (i.e. every comment I ever heard a fellow student make about the saga).
 
Perhaps I, the gangly, sheltered math nerd, am simply trying to rationalize my surprise at the debaucheries of the masses; maybe my disbelief stems from some tragic shame that all the girls laugh at me; perhaps I just cant believe that school administrators are bureaucratic and often childish.  Except, oh wait, Im not surprised, Im not embarrassed, and I certainly do believe it.
 
Yes, high school students drink, take drugs, have sex.  This should be very unsurprising to anyone.  Yes, high school administrators often lose sight of what their jobs are about, and enact weird bureaucratic barriers.  Yes, there are a few crazy teachers, and a few bored teachers.  There are classes with inane assignments.  There are students who have no interest in school, and others who are bigoted ass-holes.
 
No one is disputes any of those things.  But let us take pause, and take a deep breath, and step back for some perspective.  Peel back the layers on any organization, sit in wait for an extended period of time.  Gather the juiciest, most absurd, most terrible looking tidbits together into a compendium of the most ridiculous things you witnessed.  I guarantee that theres at least one soap opera lurking in there somewhere.  It doesnt matter whether the organization is a preschool or a non-profit activist group or a fortune 500 company (Dilbert anyone?), or the US Congress, or the Catholic Church.  Any organization has its share of dirty laundry.
 
Heck, take a single 8-10 hour date, and put the juiciest 20 minutes on a TV show, and the two people involved, however clever or intelligent or endearing they might be in real life, will come off looking like total jerks.  There are several long-running television programs based around precisely this premise.
 
My point in all this is not that Claremont HS is some sort of idealistic bastion of harmony and intellectualism.  That would be absurd in the extreme.  Its just an average public high school, with a mix of teacherssome average, some excellent, a few crackpotsand a fairly diverse (ethnically, monetarily, academically, etc.) student body.  Rather, my point is that the whole thing is overblown, excessive, exaggerated, taken out of context.  This may because Ive only read Aarons characterization of the book (apparently a praiseworthy review whose goal is thoroughly, one-hundred percent, and completely right), seen Mr. Iversens set of sound-byte interviews in the press, and on Good Morning America, and elsewhere, and heard of the story second- or third-hand.
 
This overarching pessimism about life, about social systems, about humanity, is too much.  Can we do better, in many ways, in all aspects of our lives?  Undoubtedly.  Maybe you, Mr. Anonymous, will decide to become a school-teacher, so you can share your love of learning with generations of students.  Or maybe youll become a missionary, or a social worker, so that you can help bring comfort to many lives.  Any of these is better the job of inventing a controversy for controversys sake.  There are plenty of real problems to be solved, and Ill be the first to sign up when you petition to raise teachers salaries, or to pay for teacher training, or to hire more counselors, or to fund more extracurricular activities, or, or
 
I completely agree with those who say that our increasing use of standardized tests in eduction is a waste of time.  I agree with those who say that we should emphasize writing and critical analysis, and real mathematics instead of memorization of formulas, and that education should be participatory and exploratory, rather than a suppository.  We should hire more teachers, so they can spend more time 1-1 with students.  Our focus as a society should be to make sure that every student has the capability to exercise her curiosity.  That every student can find joy in literature and history.
 
But this current discussion isnt about that.  This current discussion is oversimplified, over-dramatized absurdity.

I wonder if Mr Iversen took his inspiration from Fast Times at Ridgement High. The author of that work claimed to do the same thing: go undercover for a year at a high school. People in my age group might remember the movie which was adapted from the book.

When are you going to start writing about software again? Im really bored of these inane attempts to justify your own rejection of academia. Yes, there are entirely too many college students who dont give a fuck about actually learning anythingthats why I transferred away from my first school. And, zomgwtf, high school is not rigorous? Please, someone, stop the presses.
 
As the exchange between Anonymous and Rus above aptly illustrates, your education is what you make of it. Motivated high schoolers will take away all the education they can from the place, which in most schools these days is quite a bit (AP classes are hard, yo). For the rest of students, high school is a great place to meet people, form cliques, get high, organize keggers, fuck around on the student council, and so on. This is not a bad thing.
 
At the college level, it does seem to be a net negative that college is becoming just what you do after high school these days. Most people have neither the need nor the interest to go to college, and when they do, its quite a bring-down for them and the rest of us. (Few things rile me more than a college kid who honestly doesnt want to be in college: if thats so, you should get the hell out, youre pissing on the parade.) (On the flip side, it does seem to be unfortunately true that society in general and people in specific just dont place much actual value on a liberal arts education. It would probably be a net win if more people valued such learning-for-the-sake-of-it.)
 
Im sorry, Aaron, that you dont seem to have been able to find peers that shared your educational goals during your time in school. I assure you that they were and are there (at every college, to varying degrees). Its odd that you seem to have discovered the truism that education is an internal affairby dropping out of schoolwhile not recognizing that, for a properly motivated child, public schools and colleges (even the bad ones!) provide a rich set of opportunities to pursue ones own education. Who really gives a christgoddamn if your fellow students are in it for a resume-padding bachelors? Access to professional thinkers in any field you could care to name, the impetus to broaden your knowledge, the opportunity to meet peers with similar interests and drives: all of these are an unmitigated intellectual good.
 
An education isnt something that can be given to you: it must be pursued. Thats just the nature of the game. Some people enjoy the pursuit; they will learn all they can no matter where they are. Some have to fake it, to get a job or a diploma or whatever, and thats alright, too. Most people just seem to realize that being smart or knowledgeable is neither necessary nor sufficient for being happy. They should not be looked down on for this; whats more, it is not a failure of our educational system that it cannot transmogrify them unwillingly into miniature Russells or Gausses.
 
I just wish you would stop all this inexplicable, inane bloviating on/faux exploration of organized education. You dont need to prove anything to us, AaronSteve Jobs dropped out of school, too! We get it, you didnt like the scene. But judging from your recent writings on the subject, that seems to be not so much the fault of that scene as your own cynicism.

Hi, Jacob 
 
I hope youre aware you did a 180 between your first postings and your later posting.
 
At first, you claimed the book was lies, more lies, and damned lies.  You were quick to sneer at Aarons gullibility.   Acting as though you were privy to some sort of inside information, you knew with great certainty that Derrick was just made up.  The ESLR Carnival and Wylies threats of jail time on the PA system were just fantasy.  And poor, foolish Aaron swallowed it whole.
 
You scorned.  You gloated.  You thought you were untouchable.  But then, owing to one of those rare moments of grace that the universe delivers, there appeared on this board precisely the one individual who could answer every single lie and piece of misinformation you dribbled, and take it straight back to you, Jacob Rus.
 
Whoops!  Didnt calculate that on the TI-84.
 
In a supreme irony of life, you, of course, were the ill-informed and gullible one.  Aaron looked at both sides of the story and reached a correct independent conclusion.  You swallowed hook, line, and sinkerand then vomited backan incoherent mishmash of innuendo cooked up by snickering 16-year-olds in a high school newspaper office after sixth period.  You didnt even bother to check the source, because you knew.
 
Lacking all the critical thinking skills you call for in your oh-so-enlightened second post, you were condemned by the exact same error for which you sought to condemn.
 
The stupidity dies now.  Im glad we have an audience.  CCCP forever, Derek.  Maybe Ellie can show up too, and pound out another editorial about how theres no sex or drugs at CHS, and then we can discuss whatand the names of precisely whomshes done when she unhinges her jaw, and what fun shes had as a proud member of the Claremont Blunt Crew.
 
So here the 180 turnaround in your later posting.  When faced with the tip of an ominous and infinite iceberg of evidence thatgoshthe book is actually true, you decided to elevate the conversation to moralizing platitudes.
 
Suddenly, you are admitting that the students are drinking, using drugs, having sex, that there are bad teachers, that the administration did some truly warped things, that some students are bigoted, &c.
 
Then you add:
 
No one is disputes any of those things.
 
Well, actually, Rus, you disputed all of those things in your first posts.  Sigh.
 
So next, you suggest although all these things do, in fact, happen, the problem is that they appear in concentrated form in the book:
 
Peel back the layers on any organization, sit in wait for an extended period of time. Gather the juiciest, most absurd, most terrible looking tidbits together into a compendium of the most ridiculous things you witnessed. I guarantee that theres at least one soap opera lurking in there somewhere.
 
Well, yes, obviously, Rus, this is simply the editorial principle.  Rather than wade through a nineteen-volume blow-by-blow narrative of every word uttered during every passing period for six months, the editor has to fit as much valuable and poignant text into 464 pages as possible.   How else are you suggesting that one cut down six months into 464 pages?  This non-point is tautological and absurd.
 
Okay, now you attempt another tactic:
 
Rather, my point is that the whole thing is overblown, excessive, exaggerated, taken out of context.
 
Well, no, not at all.  Certainly not in the legal is this true? sense.  Obviously Jeremy, Simon & Schuster, and the CBS Corporation all stand absolutely behind the truth of the book, and none of them are idiots or take the issue of truth lightly.
 
So exaggerated or overblown, absolutely not.  Name a point and Ill strip away the protection of your classmates and teachers identities for you, Rus.  Context, you can hardly comment on, not having read it.
 
But, God yes, it is excessive.  The truth is shocking.
 
With your other points half-formed or lying in shreds, here comes the best part:  the hand-wringing.  Grinding all our gears on the transition, we now learn that the great problem is the overarching pessimism about humanity.  Hah hah, you actually wrote that!  About a book youve never read, and about which its kind to say youve been batting zero as far as accuracy is concerned.  Its not Dostoyevsky, its a report of what happened in your high school.
 
All of our sequiturs lost, we then learn that one should be a teacher, a missionary, or a social-worker.  Touching sentiments, Rus.  But there are many ways to help the world.  Bringing difficult truth to public light after a vast and grueling process is chief among them.
 
Youre right:  youre not funny, but youre not logical either.
 
Any of these is better the job of inventing a controversy for controversys sake
 
Im confused what youre referring to here.  Youve agreed the drugs and alcohol and sex happen, that a number of teachers are terrible, a lot of people are racist, a lot of people arent learning, and so on.  Now you claim these issues arent worthy of Americas attention?
 
Seniors in Jeremys government class believed that Spain was in the Middle East and that slavery ended in 1920.  Nationally, 70% of seniors drink, 33% drink at school, and two-thirds cant find Iraq on a map.  Soalthough the educations crap and people get wasted on Tuesday afternooneverythings all right?
 
No, Rus, its all right for YOU.  You were the one kid out of the entire class of 04 to attend Harvard.  You will get your prestigious degree and go on to, well, actually, probably to code in a cubicle at Google, but thats likely what you dream of.  You have options.  You are the top .001% of the population.
 
We are talking about the mainstream people, the vast majority of Americans who will find themselves working service jobs with some education in a world of dwindling service jobs.  Their issues in high school are the issues this book is advocating for, attempting to bring attention to, attempting to ameliorate.  Its tragic that youwho have been so privilegedwould attempt to silence that voice, much less through the blind and arrogant repetition of a pabulum of flimsy lies.
 
Your actions have consequence.  As a direct consequence of your reckless Derrick challenge, whom you knew with great certaintyhad just been made up, the identities of three of your innocent classmatescarefully protected for over two yearshave today been lain bare.
 
In repentance for your errors and gratitude for your fortune, you should apologize sincerely to Aaron for your ignorance and condescension.
 
Go your way and attempt to improve your world.

Well, without getting into this vitriolic debate about Iversens journalistic integrity (which I also consider suspect), let me just say that the generalizations youve attributed to these authors are a bit too loose.
 
I went to a public high school and then a third-tier university.  In both places, there were some subjects that I actually gave a crap about, and found genuinely interesting.  Most of my teachers actually wanted to teach, even if they werent good at it.
 
At college, I even made friends who were genuinely interested in having an active intellectual life.  They got a lot out of their classes, just as I got a lot out of mine, and we spent many hung-over saturday mornings in debate about philosophy, politics, or whatever else.
 
Yes, we were in a minority, yes, most people didnt give a crap about what they were studying.  I avoided those people because they bored me.  Im surprised you werent able to find anybody at stanford who didnt conform to the caricatures put forth by these two authors.

I think Anonymous expressed this far better than I ever could have, but Ill give it another try. The issue isnt whether the handful of people who, by chance and wealth, have managed to acquire a taste for academics and the desire to succeed. Those people will do well no matter what. The issue is whether we can make things better for everybody else.

Ive often heard it said that the public education system was designed, intentionally or de-facto, to produce good workers for factories.
 
My experiences ecertainly do not lead me to disagree and these books would appear to support that.
 
It seems to me that the higher education system has simply succombed to the same purpose in our information age. The true purpose of university is not the enrichment of the individual but the preparation for becoing a knowledge worker.
 
The great irony is that in a few short years all jobs will be most likely be contract based and require intense creativity. A lot of people are going to have re-learn to how to learn

I read the book ($1 for the hardcover at Dollar Tree!) and popped on line to see the reaction.  I stumbled across this site, and enjoyed the debate between Jacob Rus and Anonymous.  First, Jacob, as a fellow Ivy Leaguer, I have to say that you were smacked around by Anonymous.  He/she dismantled your arguments, skewered your logic, and basically made you look like a smart alec high-school student who needs about 8 years of post-secondary education, maturity, and seasoning before venturing out into the real world.  A word to the wise:  Next time, read the book.  Im not saying that it was a work of art, but, sheesh, try READING it before you critique it.
 
But enough about Jacob Rus.  Im more curious about Anonymous.  From my read, Anonymous is smart and educated, and familiar with the Claremont High School scene.  The writing style is too polished to be that of a high-school student  sorry, Jacob  and suggests a graduate-level education.  I have no reason to doubt Anonymouss claim that he/she is in a precarious legal position.  So, who exactly is Anonymous?  Teacher?  I doubt it.  The writing is too good and the logic too strong.  Administrator?  Thats my guess.  An administrator with a doctorate.  Anyone care to guess?

Title: Visiting Olin College
 
Olin College is that rarest of breeds: a new one. I didnt realize people were still starting colleges, I heard someone say when they first heard about it. The Franklin W. Olin Foundation, after funding engineering buildings on lots of college campuses, finally decided to try to build a whole school itself, eventually putting all of its money (an estimated $400 million) into Olin College and dissolving itself.
 
The college is not shy about spending the money. Every Olin student gets completely free tuition and a laptop full of engineering software. It has a big beautiful campus on the outskirts of Boston with three huge classroom buildings and six wings of dorms; each student gets a state-of-the-art dorm room.
 
The buildings are big and imposing. I first visited several years ago over the summer, back when Olin was just starting and no one was around. It was odd walking through the large, newly-built buildings all alone. I tried to imagine what it would be like when class was in session.
 
And here I am, years later, as I head to my first class. A kind and eager student, who Ill call Lex, picked me up at the T stop and drove me to the campus and is now delivering me to the Computer Architecture course, which everyone insists is one of the best-taught on campus (by which, they apparently mean that the teacher is really funny). As we walk through the hallways at 9am I again dont see a single other person. Guess nobody wakes up this early, I say.
 
Lex hands me off to a student in the Computer Architecture class who looks exactly like I imagined: long beard, geeky shirt, started several open source projects. He takes me into class  which, despite Olins reasonable gender balance in the student population as a whole, remains mostly male  where students are gabbing about things theyve built with op-amps and breadboards before things start. While Ive heard of breadboards, Ive never seen one, let alone played with one before class, and I have to admit Im not sure what an op-amp is. Wow, I think, these kids are smart.
 
Nobody here knows who I am  an odd experience for me, since lately Ive only been hanging out with friends or going to conferences where people know of me. When they ask, I simply say Im from Cambridge  a programmer at a startup if they push, but few do. Everybody just assumes Im a prospective student visiting and looks down on me accordingly. I just try to keep quiet.
 
The class itself is taken up by having students do exercises on the whiteboards and then share their results with the class. Students here seem a little less embarrassed about getting things wrong in front of everyone; theyre happy to describe what they did from their seats. After everyone has shared, the class ends, and I leave, disappointed.
 
Its still early, so Lex decides to take me on a tour of the facilities. Olin College was designed by and for engineers, the idea being that students who complete the program will have a full, rounded education in engineering. So there are classes in math and physics and basic principles of engineering, all unified into a project-based integrated courseblock or something like that. Then there are classes in materials science and biological science, classes in human factors and understanding the requirements of actual users, classes in building stuff and classes in using it.
 
There are lots of toys all over, great food, and an administration which is always asking how they can improve things further. The place reminds me of nothing so much as Google, which even has a similar kind of campus. I suppose it makes sense: this is what happens when you have engineers build an institution.
 
I grab some pasta for lunch (like at Google, the food isnt really my style) and follow Lex to a table. Unlike at other schools, Lex explains, kids here dont sit in cliques. Everybody knows everybody else, so the tables just fill up in order. We sit across from two kids who somehow turn the conversation from Dean Kamens ego to mobius strips, before telling us about a paper theyd written proving that a certain kind of graph of odd n can be reformulated on a mobius strip as a series of pentagons, showing us how by drawing on a napkin. (There are boxes of napkins on the tables, I notice, but not boxes of pens. Pay attention, institution builders!) The work seems quite impressive; I wonder if it could be published in an actual journal.
 
The kids also gab about student life. So-and-so is having a birthday and theyre going to get a keg later to celebrate. Everybody laughs and then they assure me that its only a root beer keg. Then theyre going to get a bunch of ice cream too, so itll be a huge root beer float. After lunch, I head out with them to downtown Boston to grab the keg and head back, a process that takes up most of the afternoon.
 
On the way back we stop at a music store. Bored, I pull out my Sidekick and check my email, which draws a store employees attention. Long-haired and with a weathered face in a tight black shirt, he speaks in a rockers drawl. Whooaaaa, what is thaaaat? he says and I quietly explain. He tells us how he thinks computers will eventually be replaced by miniature devices, which will be able to communicate with each other by bouncing satellite signals off the moon. Or the sun, he adds.
 
To distract him, I think of saying that my companions are just the geniuses to build such a thing, but they save me the trouble. Are you guys at MIT? he asks. No, they say, and I realize Olin has a ways to go before its brand catches up with its curriculum. He says he has a friend whos an expert in seeing the big picture and offers to hook the guys up so they can take on the small device manufacturers. (The Olin students immediately begin thinking about the tools theyd need to build small devices.) He takes down their names and emails before we head back.
 
You have to recognize that everyone has a point of view about technology, one Olin student says thoughtfully. They taught us that on the designing-for-humans course. And even if he is crazy, the other adds, his friend might be cool.
 
When we get back, I beg off from my guide Lex, saying Id like to just tour the place for myself for a bit. Lex and her circle remind me a little of Olin cultists  whenever I ask about Olin their eyes go wide and they tell me that its the greatest place ever. Perhaps thats true, I think, but I want to see for myself.
 
As I walk around the campus in the middle of the afternoon, I notice its still empty. As far as I can tell, the campus never fills out much more. It turns out 300 people dont really fill up a large campus (they barely fill up a large auditorium) which means the whole place feels like a ghost town. The immaculately cleaned, yet mysteriously empty buildings everywhere make just walking around feel creepy and lonely.
 
I catch up with an old friend of mine, who Ill call Rob, who ended up going to Olin. Rob is deeply cynical about the place and we head to the campus of Babson College (a leading business school which is literally located across the sidewalk from Olin) to dish. The Babson campus, although designed by the same hideous architect, feels like a breath of fresh air after Olins imposing emptiness. For one thing, there are students everywhere  Babson is over ten times the size of Olin. For another, the place is filled with trees, making the whole thing feel smaller and cozier. I dont recall a single tree on the Olin campus, for whatever reason.
 
The mistake everyone makes, Rob explains, is that they think Olin is a school for hackers, This isnt unreasonable, since in the computer industry, hackers are often formally called engineers. But Olin is using engineer in its traditional sense, as people who just generally build stuff. Computer hacking makes up just a tiny part of the curriculum and an even smaller part of the culture. And so computer geeks who end up attending Olin just end up feeling left out. Rob is even thinking of taking programming classes at Babson.
 
Plus, things arent as friendly as they seem. At orientation they were big on insisting Olin was a feedback culture  complete with role-playing exercises about how to properly give feedback (which Rob failed; he insists they claimed his invitation to lunch was too negative)  but apparently they dont actually listen to the feedback much. The kids sitting near Rob at the dinner table all agree. One even pulls out a card they gave him with tips on the proper way to give feedback. (When I ask her later, Lex insists that every new batch of students has its own culture. And this one, she says, enjoys shaking things up while hers enjoys stabilizing them.)
 
Despite Olins claims to be working with students, Rob insists that the place feels a lot more like doing to. Instead of having rules, for example, they have a loose honor code with provisions like respect for others. But respect for others apparently turns out to mean respect for authority in practice  a student who ran their own WiFi base station even after the campus IT department asked for it to be taken down was hauled before the student tribunal on charges of showing insufficient respect for others.
 
All of this just makes the place feel even more creepy. I think back to the kids tittering about pretending to drink alcohol, about their soliloquies for Olins greatness. Friendly fascism is the term that comes to mind.
 
Its getting late so I try to find Lex to give me a ride home, but we end up at the kegger party. Olin students insist they know how to party just like everyone else, but as you might expect, its the weirdest party Ive ever been too. The lights are turned down low and an iTunes visualizer is placed on the TV screen, as some kids try to awkwardly dance. But its not dark or drunk enough for that, so instead the girls go around standing on tip toes and giving each other hugs while speaking in high-pitched voices, before going to get costumes to prance around in.
 
Finally they break open the keg (there is some humor at how the engineering students cant figure out how to operate it) but the root beer doesnt improve the scene much. I finally manage to find Lex and prevail upon her for a ride back to the train station and as we ride through the darkness she muses about Olin on the way home. I try to tell her what I feel, but its clear she doesnt really want to hear it. To her Olin is a place of wonder; she wants validation, not refutation. I suppose my feedback is too negative.

I am completely horrified that you would take one small, small, small group of Olin students (and believe me, I know EXACTLY about whom you are speaking) and assume them to represent the entire culture.  For example, while the kegger was going on, my friends and I were on a different floor drinking actual beer, and, quite frankly, making fun of the kegger.  Were the group of Olin students who do know how to dance, drink, and throw non-awkward parties.  Well tell you the truth about the Honor Code (which mostly works), the administration (which is, in general, becoming more and more relaxed as we do crazier and crazier stuff), the party culture (which DOES exist, and rarely involves root beer), and anything else you want to hear.  Not all Olin students are cultists, nor are we all non-alcoholic, beard-bearing, geeky-t-shirt-wearing nerds.
 
Come back and visit.  But dont hang out with Lex this time.  And dont think I dont know her real name

Aaron - great essay. You really were able to capture a lot of the feelings here that are so hard for some of us here to put into words.
 
I think you grow to accept that this place is generally empty - its one of those drawbacks of choosing a place thats smaller then most pre-schools. It helps to have a car. There are no coffee shops near here (Oh Diesel, I miss thee), or any other sane way to easily walk off campus at night - it is no cambridge.
 
And your take on the respect clause is right on - its one of the most abused/problematic parts of out honor code structure. (That, and how there is a large book of rules that can be changed at whim which accompany the honor code in the student handbook, which sort of negates the honor codes all-mightiness).
 
Many of the points that you hit on are unchangeable features - we dont have the resources to have 1000 students here. And our student body is so overworked, were ridiculously apathetic about changing the things we can control. We struggle to even fix the things that have the greatest impact in our lives - amending the honor code for example. Olin is a testament to the fact that if you give students who once had lives 60 hours of school a week, it wont be hard for them to fill out the remaining 25 with the sports/music/jobs they left behind, at which point there is no time left to really care about the rest - which leaves the administration and a few individuals in even greater control. And what the administration wants, is not always what many of our students desire; the sterility of our campus, or recent censorship guidelines are great examples.
 
Were so caught up in our bubble that we dont realize how ridiculous our college can be sometimes - Once in my life I was appalled at the wifi decision you reference, but now I just accept it as a fact of Olins culture. As you saw this weekend, we thrive in our not-normalness, building our bubble even closer in. Now, I promise you if you came again, I could find you a good beer or a shot of liqueur. We do drink like any other school does, but I cant promise you the parties will be any less weird - its very different when you know everyone at a party every single time you party with them. The newness of meeting people doesnt exist here.
 
In summary, I dont like to think of Olin as a college persay, as it hardly shares any of the positive student life traits that I like to think of as college. When you think of Olin as a college you get caught up in all of the above problems. Instead, students at Olin are participating in a startup, with the startup investing heavily into each student to become a great founder/employee later in life. Here the experience is extremely well worth it. The work is fun,and so we readily dedicate our lives to work. I know that after four years from the experiences and dedication taught here, I will be one hell of a good employee. (most likely the founder as well ;)) Theres nothing inherently wrong with this - its just different.

Gotta agree wholeheartedly with An. The biggest issue at Olin, if you asked me, would be the huge gap between the camps of students who are some combination of sexless, hyperactive, intensely religious or sheltered (and will, yes, glaze over and talk cultishly about how no one drinks or does anything bad, ever, when asked anything about the school) and those who are perfectly normal but still rather brilliant and would love to see us talken off the Princeton Reviews Stone Cold Sober list. Those, my friend, are the cliques Miss Lex told you we dont have.

Wdup kid,
 
Your shit was sent on a list, and Ive read your blog. Heres what I wrote to the list, just some of my thoughts on your blog.
 
I have so many things to say about this kids blog, but I wont go into all of them.
 
One thing I will say though is that if Rob and the kids sitting near Rob think that Olin isnt up to par with their standards and if Rob is deeply cynical about the place, then they should get the fuck out of Olin and find a place that does suit them properly because apparently Olin isnt good enough for them. Dont come a college that were supposed to $@$ing build and then bitch about it being incomplete and not good enough. DUH its not complete yet, you dumb @%$; that is our job as the students here. Were suppoed to build the college and make it great for future generations. And FYI, feedback does work here you dumbshit. Why do you think the curriculum changes so much every year, and for the better? Its because the previous class gave feedback to make it better for future classes. Olins not perfect (duh), just like no college is. What the hell did this kid and Rob expect from college? I mean, you gotta be fucking kidding me here. Have you been to other colleges and heard from your friends? Or do you not have any? I wouldnt be surprised. Not many colleges have the opportunities and great environment that Olin offers.
 
FYI, Olin isnt as empty and like a ghost-town like you said. Theres always people on the great lawn and people in the lounges. Just yesterday was Opens coming out day with over 50 people there for a good number of hours. The day before that, I was out with a bunch of people juggling and doing random things; just hanging out. This kid obviously didnt really get to talk to that many people if he thinks that everyone at Olin only talks about schoolwork and op-amps. I mean, come on. Its just laughable: this kid and his mouth.  I think this kid had some kind of weird fantasy about college and how its supposed to be perfect for him and suit him perfectly, and that it should change for his own selfish pleasure. The food isnt really my style. Boo-hoo. Were sorry that our institution doesnt have food that youre used to (no doubt this kid is a spoiled little pampered mommas boy). Go eat at 1000 other institutions and I bet that you wont be able to tell me that 5 of them had better food. This kid and his friend Rob can go suck a fat one. And if you got a problem with that Rob, then you can come talk to me yourself. %#$%ing ignorant, ungrateful kid.

P.S. If you think that the parties at Olin are awkward and it was the weirdest party, then you obviously werent at the last Man-Hall party, which was fuck-awesome. Also, if you truly felt like that then obviously you are not Olin material, and are not awesome like everyone that I know and care about here at Olin. We dont fucking want you.

The feeling I get is that this guy came in with a lot of assumptions (or made some very snap judgements upon arrival), and was looking as much for validation of his point of view as he claims those overjoyedly describing Olin were.
 
Everybody just assumes Im a prospective student visiting and looks down on me accordingly.
 
I have never witnessed this behavior in all my experiences as a prospective student, in classes with one visiting, or even in the talking-about-them-when-they-cant-hear.  We love prospies, and it seems to me like we work really hard to make them feel welcome and involved.
 
After everyone has shared, the class ends, and I leave, disappointed.
 
He doesnt say what hes disappointed by, or what he was expecting, which seems expecially odd since it seems a pretty positive description of the class.
 
And yes, the campus looks a little empty on a Friday afternoon at the beginning of a long weekend (or in the halls of the academic center at a time when few classes are running).  Is that terribly surprising?  Isnt that a kind of common occurence at college campuses?  Isnt it a little presumptuous to say that because things looked a little quiet in the maybe four hours he was going around campus, it always looks like that?
 
Also, his friend Rob aside, do we actually have people who are deeply cynical of the place?  If thats how they feel, what are they doing here?  Certainly, we do have students who arent 100% satisfied, and who are willing to be more critical, but Olin has always seemed to me like one of those places that works mostly because people buy into it, and will go ahead and play along with the culture.
 
The mistake everyone makes, Rob explains, is that they think Olin is a school for hackers.Computer hacking makes up just a tiny part of the curriculum and an even smaller part of the culture. And so computer geeks who end up attending Olin just end up feeling left out.
 
If everyone is making this mistake, wouldnt that mean that there would at least be enough that they have a culture?  Are there really people who feel left out because they are too interested in computers?  Ive felt left out because of the exact opposite condition, though I know Im below the average on computer literacy.
 
He has some very strange opinions of our campus, including I dont recall a single tree on the Olin campus.  This is one of those statements that emphasizes my inpression that he was only seeing what he wanted to see from this.  No, our trees arent as tall as the ones at Babson (because they were all planted within the last five years.).  But they are around, and in kind of conspicuous places (i.e. in front of the dorms, in the middle of the O).  When the point you want to make is that the school is empty and creepy feeling, why bother payingattention to the the actual conditions?
 
Basing ones opinion of the honor code on one case of somebody who wasnt following IT policy misses a lot of the point of the honor code, and the reason people like it.  There was no mention made of the comfort and trust it allows in daily life (unlocked doors, cash sitting on white boards), or the academic allowances from it (take home tests, etc.).
 
And, really, basing an assumption on Olins party culture on Alex Wheelers root beer kegger is pretty ridiculous.  It was mentioned repeatedly throughout that event that it was a silly imitation of a party, and that we ought to go find someone from Man Hall down below who could explain what people are supposed to do with a keg.  And those are girls who go around hugging each other and speaking in high-pitched voices regardless of atmosphere.  Theyre affectionate, and have high-pitched voices.
 
So yes, this is Olin from an outsiders perspective.  But not a terribly broad look at Olin, nor a terribly close one, nor (as best as I can tell) a terribly typical one.
 
Love,
Bonnie

I would say that if this is what you think of us, you should spend more time at Olin.  Except that really, Id rather you didnt.

Instead of having rules, for example, they have a loose honor code with provisions like respect for others. But respect for others apparently turns out to mean respect for authority in practice  a student who ran his own WiFi base station even after the campus IT department asked for it to be taken down was hauled before the student tribunal on charges of showing insufficient respect for others.
 
The student in question wasnt dragged before the Honor Board by IT.  The complaint was brought by other students who were unable to connect to the internet because this students ad-hoc network was interfering with their wireless internet connections.

As a suggestion, although I dont know this campus visiting series means - what - exactly. If you are after something - in that 3, 4 years slot of your life - probably you need to get down to write them down and seek compromise - thered be many inputs from the readers of this blog, I assume.
 
I just wonder why not try England or UK - or say Europe. There might be less connection between Silicon Valley (instant wealth) thing and computation, society is generally more left leaning (generally, now its more of at transitions- difficult ones) - but you might like there better - for a while and come back. London. Berlin. etc.
 
Just a suggestion.

I would like to take direct issue with the comments that Mike Ducker made.
 
I think you grow to accept that this place is generally empty - its one of those drawbacks of choosing a place thats smaller then most pre-schools. It helps to have a car. There are no coffee shops near here (Oh Diesel, I miss thee), or any other sane way to easily walk off campus at night - it is no cambridge.
 
I have not grown to accept that Olin is empty, as Ducker implied the majority to do.  I would be willing to bet, in fact, that the majority of Oliners have not, either, but I wouldnt state that, as its rather rude to assert on a public web space exactly what other people think.
 
And your take on the respect clause is right on - its one of the most abused/problematic parts of out honor code structure.
 
How about an I think in there?  I disagree strongly with this statement.  Ill bet many other Oliners do, too.
 
And our student body is so overworked, were ridiculously apathetic about changing the things we can control.
 
No, Ducker.  Im not.  Nor are the other 100+ students serving on committees, those working their asses off to change the curriculum, those building stronger relationships with Wellesley, and those generally make Olin a better place.
 
at which point there is no time left to really care about the rest - which leaves the administration and a few individuals in even greater control. And what the administration wants, is not always what many of our students desire; the sterility of our campus, or recent censorship guidelines are great examples.
 
There are students working on all sides of that.  For example, the Office of Student Life recently outlawed weapons, but with some pressure put on the right officials in a public setting makes it so as long as you claim that your knives, swords etc. are for martial arts purposes, youre just fine.  Also, there are students protesting the student publications guidelines, even as you and I waste time commenting about it.
 
Were so caught up in our bubble that we dont realize how ridiculous our college can be sometimes
 
I realize exactly how ridiculous our college is.  It is ridiculous that these people, who are smarter, better socialized, and more intense than most any other cross-section of modern society are given a chance to live together, for close to free, for 4 years.  Thats fucking ridiculous.  Its ridiculous that while here, we can breathe fire, brew home-made beer, go rafting on Lake Waban on Wellesley College campus, stay up til 5 talking about music, sit around and smoke pot, use school money and supplies to go rock-climbing, or do whatever else you want.  I, for one, am not so caught up in the bubble, that I dont realize this; I was in the North End Saturday night with friends from Wellesley and beyond, and most the way to Framingham Sunday night with Olin alumni.  On Saturday I came back to a party, where several cases of beer were consumed at flip-cup, while in another of the partys suites, people were just hanging out and talking.
 
So please, please, please, dont talk in generalizations that just arent true.
 
Now, I promise you if you came again, I could find you a good beer or a shot of liqueur. We do drink like any other school does
 
I would argue with that, and say that there is less pressure to drink here than I have seen at other schools.
 
but I cant promise you the parties will be any less weird - its very different when you know everyone at a party every single time you party with them. The newness of meeting people doesnt exist here.
 
You obviously dont attend all the parties on campus, and it would be really nice if you didnt post, publicly, facts like this.  I, personally, have hosted parties that were 1/2 Wellesley students, and you didnt know any of them.
 
In summary, I dont like to think of Olin as a college persay, as it hardly shares any of the positive student life traits that I like to think of as college.
 
This comment brings me to a side-point: Most of all, I would like to point out that your degree is only worth what those who come after you make of it.  That is to say, if the school turns out like Mike Ducker has described it, no student of quality (academic, social, or other) would attend, and the schools reputation would go down the drain.  Spreading ideas like that only serves to weaken your own degree by discouraging people like me, and the other people who are still passionate about this place, from showing up.
 
So there, I disagree with pretty much everything Ducker said, especially the part where he implies that the majority of the college feels the same way he does.
 
Which brings me to one last point of disagreement: the honor code.  I still consider Ducker a friend, and would trust him with anything.  Im pretty angry at him for having taken liberty with my school, and for implying that I think poorly of it, or at least that I have come to accept it as anything but wonderful.  But hey, we Oliners stick together, right?

I cant say Im shocked at your conclusions based on the sample of students you happened to meet.  I am however, shocked at both Hector and Michaels responses for opposite reasons.  I am apalled that Hector would attack you for your opinions, ironically reinforcing your belief that feedback is not taken well at Olin.  Im possibly even more strongly revolted by, but not entirely surprised that Michael would speak his opinions as if they represented a larger part of the community.  The truth is that the Honor Code hasnt changed because it was written by us and we still like it.  Like any set of rules, it can be abused, and we are constantly encouraging discussion about what it means to everyone here and how it should be used.  One clause I find particularly important is Do Something which urges students not to sit back and let problems fester.  By posting here, I am invoking it.  I will further invoke it in the form of pointed e-mails to the people in question very shortly, initiating a process of negative feedback that I can only hope will induce change.
 
I know its hard for you to believe the things I do about Olin College after being given the Grand Tour by a select few of our more fringe students, and then having your ideas supported by someone who exists on the other fringe.  On the other hand, the fact that these people are allowed to exist at Olin is a sign of our culture, which I truly believe to be widely accepting and benevolent.  At Olin, people are free to be who they want to be.  For some, this is a liberating change.  For others, it seems that it fails to provide them with the negative feedback they need to discover Hey, having a nappy chin beard makes me look unemployable, or Talking like fingernails on a chalkboard isnt cute; its annoying, possibly even painful.  These are concepts that are not lost on 90% of the student population here.  In fact, Ive been involved in many a doomsday scenario discussion where we discussed the inescapable eventuality that these exact people will soon enter the world and reflect back on Olin.  Every outcome appears to be grim.
 
You have essentially no incentive to ever come back to Olin and reassess your findings after being treated to what seems to be one of the most depressing accounts of a college visit Ive ever read, and then being insulted and lambasted by what appears to be an angry 12 year old who just learned the F-word.  If you ever find yourself in the Boston area, in a forgiving mood, and wanting a free meal, I will extend this offer to you.  My suitemates and I will treat you to lunch or dinner (transportation included) anywhere in the Greater Boston area and talk to you about being an average Olin student.  We promise to shave, wear big-people clothing, and speak at a frequency safe for glassware.

Aaron, Id like to start off by saying that I think youre a very effective writer. I read your posts pretty regularly, and if theres one thing I notice consistently its that your writing craft always seems to gracefully support the points that youre trying to make. However, I also know that an effective writer and an unbiased writer are easily confused by some readers, so Id like to offer a disclaimer to those who read the post: an outsiders one-day visit to a place, visiting one class and under one tenth of the population, cannot accurately represent the place. The resulting impressions are impressions of their experience, not necessarily reflections of reality.
 
Overall, I feel that the tone that youre going for in the piece is negative, but your tone doesnt always seem to gel with your observations, and your observations dont always seem to gel with what I know as my daily reality.
 
That said, I guess Id like to address some more specific points of your post as best I can.
 
First, everyone doesnt agree that Comp Arch is the best-taught course on campus. I took that class. I thought that it was well taught, and the professor IS funny. That class is one of the most effective uses Ive ever seen of a tablet PC in the classroom. However, it sounds like you came for a review day, which means that you saw a bunch of students collectively sharing knowledge and preparing for a test. If youre disappointed in the teaching, then keep in mind that its because you didnt actually see any. It was collaborative review time. Everything else that you say about the class actually sounds overwhelmingly positive, so it seems like thats the only thing that could make you come away disappointed.
 
Im sorry that you felt you were looked down upon in class as a prospie. Id echo what others said earlier and say that I generally feel that we treat prospectives very well. Maybe what you were actually experiencing is awkwardness because students knew that you werent a prospie but didnt know what you might be instead and it didnt feel polite to ask?
 
I cant tell if your ninth paragraph (this is what happens when you have engineers build an institution) is supposed to be positive or negative. All of the listed evidence sounds positive, but the final phrase still sounds negative in the context of the piece. I continually notice this mismatch throughout your post.
 
Lex and her circle ARE Olin cultists, in a way. When youre building something, you do become attached to it, but the level of attachment and the ability to rationally distance yourself from it vary with the individual. Not all students are cultists, and we talk about Olin very differently to people within the community (what needs to change mode - primarily negative) vs. people from outside (whats really great mode - primarily positive). I would argue that the literature and admissions staff of most institutions do the same thing. At such a small, new school, we all take on the role of admissions staff externally to a certain extent.
 
I dont know who Rob is, but Im going to have to respectfully disagree with his statement that Olin isnt a school for hackers. In my opinion, Olin is the ideal school for hackers. I consider myself primarily a computer hacker and I love it here. There is so much opportunity in and out of the curriculum to just pursue projects and wild ideas that I find interesting and actually receive credit for it. And most of the schools resources (computer equipment, faculty, electronic components) are available for personal projects with only minor caveats. If anything, Id say that non computer geeks are the ones who feel more left out here (and Ive had several conversations with friends about that exact occurrence.)
 
Its apparent that you only have a cursory understanding of the issues surrounding the one honor board case that you cite. The student was brought before the honor board because their wireless AP was interfering with other students ability to connect to the actual wireless network. Thats the only reason it came before the honor board: it was a respect for others issue. Not a simple case of breaking written rules.
 
Finally, in response to the entire sub-thread about kids pretending to drink alcohol. Please dont let your one experience with an Olin party color your impressions of the entire student body. Just because Olin is smaller doesnt mean that our population is more homogeneous than at other schools. We have a wide range of people ranging from never leaves their room to never sleeps in their room, just like at any school. Im not sure if you were expecting people passed out in the hallways or what. Luckily theres less of that here than most places because we have a little more respect for each other. But that doesnt mean that a root-beer kegger is a typical Olin party any more than it would be a typical party elsewhere. Im pretty sure the root-beer kegger was actually meant to be ironic. Its just a function of the people you happened to hang out with. There are all kinds of people everywhere. Were no different from any other school in that regard, so take your experience with a grain of salt and please dont transform a single observation into a school-wide norm. Thats a dangerous proposition with any group larger than one.
 
Whew, OK that was long. I wouldnt worry so much about replying to this (Im sure many more will responses will be coming) but I know that you have an audience, and I dont want you to color their perceptions of our school just because you can make a very limited experience sound convincing by way of effective writing.
 
Finally, a warning for the future (probably of limited usefulness at this point): Dont use pseudonyms on Olin students and expect it to stay anonymized for anyone within the community. Weve only got 300 students. Small size has both positive and negative consequences.

An addendum: Some of my peers have expressed concern that I was trying to speak for the entire student body in my post. Like most blog comments, I was speaking for myself, from my own observations and concerns regarding my personal experiences at the school. While it is my personal belief that there are others who share many parts of my thinking, as one can see by the other posts, there are many different and opposing views to mine at Olin.

I didnt mean to present this as a definitive, representative word about Olin. It is what it is: one persons experience. But Im glad that others have chosen to share theirs here.
 
It is surprising, though, that the people defending Olin have all chosen to remain anonymous while the people criticizing it have signed their names. Usually its the opposite.
 
Hector: The problem is that Olin is stuck in between; it neither trusts its students enough to let them build it nor is finished enough to let them fight enough. (And my comment about the food was in reference to Google.)
 
Bonnie: Coming in, as I think the article suggests, I wanted to love Olin. I came because I thought it would be amazing. To see the other side of it took me quite a while.

Aaron,
     As a new student to Olin College this year, I was disappointed to read your weblog insulting what we are trying to build here. Most (though not all) of the students with whom I interact everyday take great pride in their school, as they are personally responsible for its reputation, its culture, and everything else that Olin is. Many of our students turned down very prestigious, ivy-level colleges to come to unaccredited little Olin, not to be disappointed in it, but to risk their future in making it what they feel it should be. I will rely on the Respect for Others clause of the Honor Code when I respectfully disagree with almost everything Michael Ducker says, deferring to George for the details. However, I have no less respect for him as a person, and will treat him no differently, because that is an important part of the culture here.
     Also, I was at the root beer kegger that you attended. I take offense at the insulting manner in which you describe the wonderful seniors who hosted what was actually a 21st birthday celebration, as well as the way in which you describe the party go-ers. Possibly a little background is in order: this was a party for a student who doesnt drink, with a group of friends who are mostly (though certainly not universally) abstinent from alcohol. I find this group of people to be an important support group for my similar decisions, as well as a set of wonderful people I am proud to call friends. Please dont accept our invitation to our brand of party, just to berate and insult us later. Of course there are parties with alcohol on campus. I vehemently oppose underaged drinking, but I hold the respect and trust of my schoolmates above all us and will respect their decisions as long as they respect mine. Youll find this is a fairly mainstream view here. I would also like to remind the other Olin students posting here or on the mailing list to stand by this view and not to belittle root beer keggers or high, squeaky voices, as I enjoy both.
Thank you for accepting my negative feedback, and please revisit Olin anytime. I would love to try to show you why most people here love their school so intensly.

To be clear, I think Olin has a lot of really impressive aspects as well as some less-than-ideal ones. But nobody should take my one days worth of experience as the final word, nor assume that what I like and dislike will be the same for them.

Just making a point about the anonymity of those defending Olin; George Jemmott, Lee Edwards, Sean McBride, and I are not anonymous.  I only see one anonymous defending comment and one anonymous offending (?) comment with regards to Olin, minus the few that seem to be defending or attacking you personally.
 
And, Id like to stand up for the so called sexless, hyperactive, intensely religious or sheltered students.  Everybody knows that sex, drinking, and other acts of debauchery happen.  Not everyone talks about them because they have a lot less influence on their personal experience here, but we will acknowledge their existence if asked the same way non-participants would about sports teams, religious groups, fire breathing, and Republicans.  Generally, were pretty good about not judging those who make different choices.  At any school, you will find people who participate in these activities and people who dont, and there is often a pretty wide disconnect in the cultures.  The root beer kegger did have a back room with alcohol, but its not what that party was for.

Aaron,
 
While your perspective may have been formed a bit too quickly, overall Id like to thank you for telling the truth.
 
I have noticed the friendly fascism from the very beginning (I am a freshman now).  On one of the first nights, we had a floor meeting in West Hall about dorm policies where the atmosphere was supposed to be open and understanding.  After realizing that people were avoiding the sensitive issues, I started speaking up about drinking, sex, etc.  The awkwardness/fear that I sensed from the rest of my class was overwhelming, so now I understand that openness excludes any real conversation.
 
I do not feel socially accepted by a significant portion of my class.  This is due mostly to the fact that I have sex every day and drink on the weekends - entirely private things - rather than any rudeness/unfriendliness that I show in person.  People love to say that they respect everyone regardless of their lifestyle, but this is bullshit.
 
In spite of these things, I am optimistic and I feel you should be too.  Consider that during the first few years of Olin, there were no upperclassmen to show the freshmen the ways of college, for example how to party.  Now that we have upperclassmen, things are getting better.  I know that certain members of my class hold the specific desire to corrupt Olin further.  We have only been here for one month.  Give us time.

I would like to comment on building Olin College.  As a bit of background, I am currently Olins VP of Campus Life (a position formerly held by Lee Edwards, who commented on this post previously), and deal regularly with issues that fall under the heading of building Olin College.  The most recent example of this are the so-called censorship guidelines.
 
They are in fact titled publication guidelines.  The Board of Trustees wished us to have something in place to encourage student publications to carefully consider the possible consequences of any and all material that they publish.  The first draft was not written by a student, and has been essentially rejected by the student body.  We (a 5-student committee) have drafted a new set of guidelines, approximately 3 sentences in length, and basically saying abide by the honor code, and if you are unsure, ask somebody.  This draft will be revised further by the entire student government, then shared with the student body along with further solicitations for feedback before being sent to the Board of Trustees at the end of the month.
 
In telling you this, I would like you to notice a few things: guidelines are not imposed on us with no hope of changing them, and are not imposed on us at all without first soliciting feedback unless absolutely necessary (the previously mentioned weapons guideline was in response to a Massachusetts state law requiring us to have such a guideline).  Also, we are certainly trusted enough to be allowed to build large parts of the College (the Honor Code, the Constitution, guidelines, etc.), and they (the administration) has stopped nobody from fighting for change.  My position is evidence for this, if nothing else.  As well as serving on the student government Executive Board, I serve on the Board of Trustees Student Life Subcommittee (which has on the order of 5 other members), and my voice is certainly not ignored.  (There are student representatives on other BOT committees, as well.)  I would then like you to note that there are certainly students passionate enough about Olin to put lots of time and effort into improving it.
 
I will not say that improving Olin is easy.  It isnt.  It can take time to affect change.  The real difference with Olin, however, is that change is encouraged, and the time it takes is often on the order of weeks (occasionally months, as with more major changes, such as curriculum or scheduling, etc.).  I certainly dont feel powerless to change Olin.  No Olin student should feel powerless, in fact.  Feedback is solicited all the time, from multiple sources - student government, faculty, staff, the Office of Student Life, etc.  An Olin student is only made powerless by his or her own apathy.
 
There is so much more I could say on this subject, but unfortunately I have a Partial Differential Equations problem set due tomorrow, and it really cant wait.

I was debating whether or not to post, but I ultimately decided to.
 
Im an alumni, one of the first graduating class. I am an Olin cultist. Among fellow Olin students/alumni, I will bitch and moan with the best of them. When talking to prospective students, I am selling a product. Of course Im going to accentuate the positive. Olin is something that I helped to create and I have a ton of ownership in it and while I recognize the problems, Im excited to tell people about what has gone right. Youve created a thing or two of your own, I know  I have to imagine that when selling your creations you talk about the good stuff, even though you know it may not necessarily be perfect, right? So understand that when people saw you as a prospie, they were seeing you as a customer. When we get people like reporters (as we did in IEEE Spectrum, for example, last year) well be a little more candid, because were not trying to convince them to come. I think its reasonably standard practice.
 
Anyhow, overall, I just wanted to say that having invested SO much of myself in Olin, I am incredibly proud of it. Im proud of the way it prepared me for the real world, of the people weve attracted since opening our doors, and of the fact that within five short years we have people like you interested in checking us out and writing about us. Im also proud that this is sparking so many discussions at Olin (or so I hear). This is good. This is exactly why Olin is a great place  because someone will take this discussion and DO SOMETHING about it. I hope that your friend Rob will be involved in that, if he is so disenchanted. Every year, the freshmen need to find their own reason to make their mark on the school. Maybe this is the motivation this year.
 
There will always be Olin cultists because someone will always find their happy niche and be really thrilled about it. Im glad for those people. It is up to the others who are unhappy to really make it something they can be happy with. Olin will be forever changing and evolving because of this. There is no right state. There is a better state. Rather like evolution, it takes a while to see and some strange mistakes will happen along the way, but it will happen.
 
Thank you for your insights. As a very wise frosh on here said, its good for people to really think about what Olin means to them. I hope youll have a chance to visit Olin in a few years time to see how things have changed.

First of all, Im Lex, as many of the Oliners have undoubtedly figured out long ago. My name is Mel, my usual handle is mchua, and I have been called a hacker by other hackers; those are all the credientials Ill present at this time.
 
Note that Ill be making sweeping generalizations in this reply. These are my own viewpoints, narrow as they may be. I would like to expand them. Consider this an open invitation (to anyone) to talk about anything (including and especially negative feedback). Hell, Ill come visit you if youll have me; I may be an odd guest, but Ill do my best to get to know you on your own turf. And I can only speak for myself, but I hope that others would and will say the same thing I just have. To put my money where my mouth is, my email is mallory dot chua at students dot olin dot edu. Please spam.
 
Background: Aaron was at the Olin panel at the Wikimania conference this summer and came up to talk to us (students & profs) afterwards, mentioning he was interested in a visit. I ran across my notes to that effect a few weekends ago and sent an email offering a ride from the T. So I dont really know Aaron. I would have done the same for anyone whod asked about visiting Olin (or getting a ride to somewhere or questions answered about something), and I believe a reasonable number of Oliners (from different groups) would have done the same, so it was to an extent purely chance that Aaron got the viewpoint of Olin that he did. He could easily have gotten a different one; it wouldnt have been more accurate or complete, just different.
 
I dont think Aarons post was badly intended. In fact, much of its great, if a melodramatic. There were many truths in it, some of which we have a hard time admitting to ourselves. However, the impression was also incomplete for a variety of reasons (not the least of which is that you cant get to know a school in a day). Aaron, I apologize for not being able to show you the full range of this school; its tough to show someone else a viewpoint that you dont share. Im glad to see all the different responses - especially the conflicting and contradictory ones, especially the ones I completely disagree with - to this blog post. Ironically, our replies to this blog entry may give him (and us) a better idea of what Olin is like than his visit actually did.
 
Others have made excellent points about what Olin actually is like from their viewpoint. I wont rehash them here.
 
Ill be the first (well, would have been the first had I checked my email earlier) to admit that my views, friends, and life are not that of the average Oliner, if there is such a thing. Folks, there is no average Oliner. And Im not being public-relationsy here. Im optimistic, hard of hearing, asexual, geeky, dont drink (until Im 21; give me 7 months), insomniac, and Im sure you could rattle off a long string of surface adjectives here; you could rattle a similar list off for any of us, and the lists would all be different, although some would occur more frequently than others. But Ive never heard that any adjective other than non-Oliner (by school attendance) makes you a non-Oliner. My point is that adjectives != people; when I get to know you, I want to get to know you, not the tag cloud surrounding you. People shouldnt be pigeonholed. Kat wrote a particularly good post on this some time back. (http://katzor.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_katzor_archive.html#115297768084009037)
 
Aaron, Im sorry that you dont feel like you were able to give your feedback on Olin on the way back; I would greatly like to hear it if youve got any more thoughts, and will glady email you or come by in person the next time Im in Cambridge. Im hearing impaired and rely heavily on lipreading (which I cant do that very well in a darkened car), which leads to me musing more than listening when Im driving at night, as you noted - but I should have warned you about that, so thats my fault. I apologize if that made you feel like you werent able to speak freely, but I do hope youll take up the offer to talk again if there are other things youd like to say. As an aside, its usually considered good form to give people (and institutions) feedback to their face instead of having them find out through other channels; its not something Im upset about in the slightest, but might be something to consider in the future (have you shown any of the other schools what you wrote about them?) especially if you want to make any changes happen.
 
I also hope youll take Lee (or other Oliners) offers to visit again and see the school from their point of view. Youll find it a very different place.
 
Finally, please dont think that the more cynical and critical among us are the only ones that see Olin as it really is, or that they are the only ones unafraid to speak the truth. They do speak truth; it is, like all truth, part of a larger story.
 
Thanks for listening.

The work seems quite impressive; I wonder if it could be published in an actual journal.

First of all, thank you for this positive comment.  I enjoyed working on this paper, and I guess I still have quite a bit enthusiasm when I grab the napkins at the lunch table
 
As an informational sidenote in response to the shielded critism I sensed, this research work was a continuation of research that was done the year before, by an Olin freshman and faculty from Olin and Babson.  The paper crafted from that year has recently been published in IEEE Transactions; I can give you more information if you are interested in reading it.  As for the paper that I was involved in, it has been submitted to Discrete Applied Mathematics (DAM).
 
I think this underlies an important quality of Olin students.  This is by no means the only research paper created by studentsin fact, we have had a number of papers published in actual journals, and a number of presentations at actual conferences.  In addition, students can (and do) get involved in this undergraduate research any timeeven as freshmen.  I feel it is important that at Olin, you are encouraged to tackle large problems, such as getting published in an actual journal, as early as freshman year.
 
Again, if you are interested in any of this information, I can give you copies of research papers, lists of papers published by Olin students, and any other information you might be interested in.

So I will be one of the anonymous critisizers of Olin, just so you know that we exist. I agree with you on many points. I feel, indeed, that Olin seems very happy about positive feedback, but a bit wary of negative feedback. I also feel that not having a fixed curriculum can, at times, be inefficient toward the learning process. I agree that Olins academic buildings are less populated than most, and that Olins collection of baby trees isnt as scenic as Babsons shadow-imposing trees.
 
But I go to Olin, so to wallow in the negative isnt really productive. As an outsider, youre allowed to critisize every imperfection, but if you were actually attending Olin, and people in high places were actually asking you for feedback, you might have to adopt a different strategy - it isnt cultish at all to want to spew positive feedback, if its about your product. I, like Ducker, have learned to live with Olins imperfections if only because its perfections outweigh them tenfold. One thing to keep in mind: Olin offers free tuition to all admitted students. We may not be prestigious, if only because we dont care about prestige. We care about learning. Ive attended too many places where the level of knowledge someone learns overshadows the quality of the process of learning. Maybe teachers not spewing facts will keep us from knowing as much as someone from a more traditional setting, but it wont keep us from being able to learn it faster. All these things make Olins wierdness worth it.
 
And about the ghost-town thing, its been covered already, but, well, you really need to visit West Hall in the evenings. Thats where the college life really is. That, or Ben Linders office at 2AM.

I.e., they are on Olins campus, and therefore: we have trees.
 
We also have a forest.  Its the big green thing in the picture with all the red x marks, in the middle, beyond the soccer field.  But thats another issue, I suppose.

I visited Olin in Feb 08 and also found the campus to be rather empty.  After walking around for a while I discovered that the students were all in their classrooms 40 minutes before the start of the class period.  They were busy chatting and making last minute preparations for class.  My overall impression was that the students seem serious about their work without being neurotic.

Title: Visiting Mission Hill
 
The new Mission Hill School is located in the middle of Boston, in Roxbury. By the time the subway reaches the neighborhood, all the white people have already left the train. The school itself is nestled into a building long-ago abandoned by a Catholic High School. When it first moved in, they found the remnants of the last high school class had never been removed, their effects somehow frozen in time.
 
The streets are gritty, the faces dark, and I dont exactly feel comfortable walking outside. This isnt the place you imagine starting a progressive school. And when you learn that Mission Hill is a public school, part of the Boston Public School system, it seems even less likely. Yet, when educational reformer Deborah Meier set out to build a modern school, thats what she picked. They got a special license from the government and the unions to operate it as a pilot school and begun tossing out the normal rules and building it from the ground up on progressive principles.
 
Meier has since left, as has Straughton, her successor, leaving a woman who introduces herself as Ayla (everyone here goes by their first names). Ayla seems a little overwhelmed, both by the demands of the job and her sudden promotion to the top, but she somehow handles everything with kindness and composure.
 
Welcome to our school, she says, smiling so sweetly that I have trouble believing shes a principle. As she continues talking, outlining the schools unique mission and the habits of mind it hopes to achieve, some kids begin running and screaming in the halls outside. She gets up and heads to the door. Now well get to see the other side of her, I think. She seems nice enough to us but shell start screaming at the kids. But she doesnt say a thing, she just closes the door and sits back down with us.
 
After the overview, she takes us upstairs to get a sense of what classroom life is like. The school is nice enough  I wish I went to school here, the education students visiting with me gush  with happy decorations, small class sizes (20 is the max.), friendly and dedicated teachers, and very active classrooms. The kids, a very racially mixed crowd, seem quite bright and full of joy, and I cant help smiling for the first twenty minutes, as we watch them bouncing around painting and sculpting.
 
When we move to math class, things are a little different. For morning math meeting, the kids sit in a circle in the front of the room, as the teacher goes around asking each one to say something about subtraction before writing it on the board. The teacher tries to be non-judgmental, but when someone says something wrong, he cant help but ask the rest of the class if they think what that person said was right. (Once, when it actually was right, he has to add the caveat Im not saying it was wrong, I just want to know what other people think.) At one point, a child asks him to write a one with twelve zeroes up on the board, saying its a million. The teacher points out that its a lot more than a million and counts out for the class what it actually is. He miscounts though, and claims its one septillion. (Its only a trillion.) I dont say anything.
 
Later, the teacher tells us how much he likes morning math circle because it gives everyone a chance to speak and think about things. But its clear that most of the students are bored most of the time (including me) while others dont exactly enjoy speaking. Afraid theyll get the answer wrong and look stupid in front of the whole class, they speak quietly or cover their mouth while they talk, trying to make sure only the teacher can hear them. When the teacher indicates they were right and asks them to speak up, then theyre happy to tell the rest of the class.
 
After everyone has spoken, the class adjourns so people can get the memoirs theyve been working on to share with everyone. We head to a class where theyre shouting out the names of states on a map. The class is going to explain how America became America by looking at the patterns of migration on maps, the teacher assures us, but right now it looks like the class is only memorizing how to spell stupid state names.
 
At this point our visit is officially over and we have to head back to a final wrap-up with the principal, but as I think about it and think back to my own school experience, I begin to wonder: is this any different?
 
There are some differences, of course. This school feels much cozier and comfortable, for example. I dont feel odd just hanging out in the halls. The teachers are all very self-conscious about trying to be student-centered and democratic (the principal explains how they terminated their relationship with an afterschool program because they refused to stop giving kids rewards, referring skeptical student-teachers to Alfie Kohns books for an extreme position on rewards). But while their hearts may be in better places, its not clear the effect is that much different.
 
Still, that in itself is a pretty incredible achievement. I went to an extremely rich, white, private school on an expensive and lush campus in the middle of the richest zip code in the country. That you can build a public school of equal quality for kids in the inner city is an impressive achievement. Just not the one I was expecting.

Hey, this is a great post  very hopeful and descriptive.
 
There are a few details Id correct though. Roxbury is the geographic center of Boston, not the edges. Those of us in Roxbury (and out as far as Hyde Park, West Roxbury, Brighton, Mattapan) pay taxes to the City of Boston. Boston does not end at Mass Ave as some would like to think.
 
Also, the part about all the white people have left the train is a bit sensational. Regardless of whether you took the green line or the orange line to Mission Hill, the train is going to pass through some rather mixed neighborhoods after it drops you off. Maybe some statistics on the makeup of Mission Hill would be more informative? Also, its important to note that BPS doesnt assign students to schools by neighborhood. Its done by lottery, but not entirely randomly (parents can choose which schools to try for). So the racial makeup (and income and other factors) of the neighborhood doesnt really have a whole lot to do with the school, except that there is a tendency for teachers to look for positions at schools in their preferred neighborhoods, and families do tend to try for neighborhood schools when entering the lottery.

The main reason all the white people left the train is because. In the morning, most people are going in to town for employment.  If you ride the train outbound at 5 pm, there will be a good mix of folks riding out to Jamaica plain, forest hills etc.
 
Come back to Mission Hill anytime, a whole lot of shaking going on

Title: Mamet on Auditions
 
A special guest post from David Mamets True and False. The discussion is notionally about acting, but it applies far more broadly. Try substituting programmer for actor, for example.
 
Those with something to fall back on invariably fall back on it. They intended to all along. That is why they provided themselves with it. But those with no alternative see the world differently. []
 
Those of you with nothing to fall back on, you will find, are home.
 
(34-36)
 
The audition process selects for the most blatant (and not even the most attractive) of the supplicants. As a hiring tool, it is geared to reject all but the hackneyed, the stock, the predictablein short, the counterfeit.
 
[]
 
The producers are not interested in discovering the new. Who in their right mind would bet twenty million dollars on an untried actor? They want the oldand if they cannot have it, they want its facsimile.
 
These gatekeepers understand their job to be this: to supply the appropriate, predictable actor for the part. They base their choice on the actors appearance, credits, and quoteas if they were hiring a plumber.
 
If this sounds tedious, reflect that the actor himself is habituated into the process and endorses it from his first experience of it. And his first experience is the school.
 
The acting school and its lessons are may times harsh, but their rigor and extent is comfortable and predictable. The lessons of the stage, on the other hand, are often devastating and almost beyond bearing.
 
The school, like the audition process, has a clear and simple structure of commands and rewards. If, and as long as, the student propitiates the teacher, she may be disappointed but she will rarely be humiliated. To the extent that she internalizes her subscription to the system (It is harsh, but I know in my heart it is just, or at the very least, unavoidable) she can enjoy freedom from anomie. If she never ventures out of the confines of the system, she can live, whether employed or unemployed, free from terror.
 
Teachers of audition technique counsel actors to consider the audition itself the performance, and to gear all ones hopes and aspirations not to toward the actual practice of ones craft (which takes place in from of an audience or a camera), but toward the possibility of appealing to some functionary. What could be more awful?
 
For much of the beauty of the theatre, and much of the happiness, is in a communion with the audience. The audience comes to the show prepared to respond as a communal unit. They come prepared (and expecting) to be surprised and delighted. They are not only willing, but disposed to endorse the unusual, the honest, the piquant. Everything the audition process discards.
 
[]
 
Dont confess when you come offstage. If you have gained an insight, use it. THey say silence builds a fence for wisdom. To keep ones own counsel is difficult. Oh, how terrible I was . How difficult to keep those words inhow comforting they are. In saying them one creates an imaginary group interested in ones progress. But give up the comfort of an imaginary group. This group that is judging you is not real; you invented it to make yourself feel less alone.
 
I knew a man who went to Hollywood and languished jobless for a period of years. A talented actor. And he got no work. He came back at the end of the period and lamented, I would have been all right if theyd just sat me down on day one and explained the rules.
 
Well, so would we all. But who are they? And what are the rules? There is no they, and there are no rules. He posited the existence of a rational hierarchal group acting in a reasonable manner.
 
But show business is and has always been a depraved carnival. Just as it attracts the dedicated, it attracts the rapacious and exploitative, and these parasites can never be pleased, they can only be submitted to. But why would one want to submit to them?
 
The audience, on the other hand, can be pleased. They come to the show to be leased, and they will be pleased by the honest, the straightforward, the unusual, the intuitiveall those things, in short, which dismay both the teacher and the casting agent.
 
Keep your wits about you. It is not necessary to barter your talent, your self-esteem, and you youth for the chance of pleasing your inferiors. It is more frightening but it is not less productive to go your own way, to form your own theatre company, to write and stage your own plays, to make your own films. You have an enormously greater chance of eventually presenting yourself to, and eventually appealing to, an audience by striking out on your won, by making your own plays and films, than by submitting to the industrial model of the school and studio.
 
But how will you act when you, whether occasionally or frequently, come up against the gatekeepers?
 
Why not do the best you can, see them as, if you will, an inevitable and preexisting condition, like ants at a picnic, and shrug and enjoy yourself in spite of them.
 
Do not internalize the industrial model. You are not one of the myriad of interchangeable pieces but a unique human being and if youve got something to say, say it, and think well of yourself while youre learning to say it better.

Title: College: Commodity or Community?
 
When it was time for me to pick colleges, our family flew to Cambridge, Mass. and went on the tour of Harvard University. Its a grand, elegant campus, the school has a singular reputation, the neighborhood is one of the most interesting in the world. And yet, on the college tour, this isnt what they told us. They mentioned a bit about John Harvard and the 1700s but spent most of their time telling us how great it was they had shopping week, where you could try out different courses for a couple classes.
 
The other month, I visited the University of Chicago. Chicago has a worldwide reputation as a tough-minded school. It seems like every field has a Chicago School of thought and the Universitys former presidents are responsible for things like the Great Books. But you wouldnt know that from the tour  the only time actually studying was mentioned was when one kid said hed heard the University had a nose-to-the-grindstone reputation. Well, the tour guide said, you can work hard if you want, and then went back to talking about the sports program. (Whenever I feel like exercise, the Universitys president once said, I lie down until the feeling passes.)
 
It was as if the entire admissions program had been through a focus group, every bit of individuality shorn off. They put their self-description through a series of tests and only the generic things that every student finds themselves agreeing with survived the ordeal. Oh no, they now insist, were just like every university. We want to let you be you. But why go to a University for that? I can be me at home just fine.
 
No, the real reason I want to go to a University  and the reason, when you get right down to it, everybody else seems to be interested in as well  is the people. I want to go to a place filled with people like me, but smarter; a place where you cant help but learn.
 
The key phrase there is people like me. What I want to know is what the culture is like. To unfairly overgeneralize, people at Harvard are snobbish, people at Stanford are lazy, and people at MIT are nerds. But (with the possible exception of MIT which actually sells nerd pride clothing) none of these places advertise this fact. After all, advertising your individuality alienates some of the focus group. In fact, thats exactly the point!
 
And yet, somehow, the cultures remain. Its not clear to me whether the university itself has a culture (perhaps passed down by the older students and professors) and whoever attends simply learns to conform or whether theres a secret bulletin Im not getting about which university each kind of person should go to. I suspect the former, since Ive heard that even houses at Harvard, to which students are assigned randomly when they arrive, manage to develop a culture of their own.
 
So how to decide where to go?
 
There are some people who say that if you go to a large enough university, youll be able to find a subculture of people you can get along with. At MIT, for example, a complicated rush system at the beginning of the school year allows incoming freshman to sample a variety of dorms and then floors within that dorm to find the place they belong. The dorms apparently put on lavish shows to communicate their culture to the incoming students and people seem fairly happy with where they end up.
 
MIT is a bit of a special case, of course, but some insists that similar subcultures exist at every college, you just have to seek them out. Perhaps thats true, but even so, whats the point of the university then? Theres a subculture of people I can get along with right here; I want to go to school for something a little more concentrated.
 
Colleges need to drop the focus-group-enforced blandness. As Malcolm Gladwell would put it, people dont want ten varieties of bland tomato sauce to choose from. Some people love mild and some love extra-chunky. Trying to appeal to both only makes the experience worse for everyone. It doesnt seem like you should have to go to college to realize that.

The MIT administration very deliberately lightens up on MIT culture in those tours, for fear of alienating parents and potential students.
 
MIT itself definitely has a culture, maintained by a combination of selection and the people who stay around. For example, there is no such thing as Gentlemans C at MIT, as there is in Harvard (i.e. rich person drafting through the class, because thats what theyre supposed to do).

 on October  7, 2006 #
 
I suspect that the cultures of the houses at Harvard is a fading remnant of the cultures that formed before students were randomly assigned to a house. For a long time, houses were chosen by the students. When I was being sorted into a house (the spring of 1994), we were able to choose four preferred houses, and were randomly assigned to one of those. Under either system, students with common interests tended to cluster in the same handful of houses. There were houses with many athletes (that tended to be near the athletic fields), houses with lots of quiet studious pre-med types, and so forth. Each house had a distinct reputation and culture because the system encouraged communities to form.
 
Incidentially, the students werent happy when the assignments were completely randomized, but that was easy for the administration to resolve; just wait until all the students who remembered how things used to be had graduated.

Caltech has a similar rush system, except that you get to specify your top 3(out of 6), and the top 3 house hierarchy gets to pick. Every one gets accomodated some place of course. 
Back, oh just about 2 decades ago, when I got into Caltech, I fancied myself good at sports. Atleast by Caltechs rather pathetic standards. However, I was soundly rejected by the jocks(Fleming) and ended up in the hippie house(Dabney). Turns out, I loved itand over the years ended up being a bit of a hippie myself. Which all in all, was a good thing :)

Some people have the opportunity to pick their college. And then there are the rest of us who, often due to a lack of money, are glad just to be admitted to one.
 
Beyond hearing thru the grapevine that this public school was known as a party school, or that one had a winning football season the year before, the rest of us never even suspected that a college had a particular culture  let alone subcultures.
 
My intent in this response is not to vent bitterness. I am merely want to point out that for many college graduates, what you have described is an entirely foreign world.

Title: Whats Radical About the Liberal Arts?
 
The leaves are turning brown, the students are filling up Harvard Yard, and the mass emails are filling up my mailbox, all reminding me that I would be starting junior year right about now if I hadnt left Stanford. For an academephile like me, this inspires no small amount of nostalgia, and so Ive been eager to get my hands on a copy of Michael Berubs bestseller, Whats Liberal About the Liberal Arts? (Copies had been checked out of all the nearby libraries, so I spent the morning sitting in the Harvard Coop reading the entire book there. Yeah, Im such a cheapskate.)
 
The book is a response to the conservative attacks on academia as a leftist preserve in need of some affirmative action for conservatives. In response, Berub outlines a two-pronged plan for handling conservatives in academia; an outline of a procedural liberalism for the liberal arts. First, in the classroom, conservatives should be given reasonable accommodation for their views, just like any other student in the class. Second, in the professoriate, conservatives should try to reform academia by joining it, just as the womens liberation movement did in the 1970s.
 
For the first, Berub gives examples from his own classroom: a conservative makes a claim (e.g. the Japanese internment was justified), Berub patiently acknowledges it, points to sources supporting and opposes it, and sits down with the conservative outside of class to give them further attention. Berub comes off as unfailing patient and gracious, while the conservatives appear wrong-headed and often simply lazy.
 
And yet. Despite my enormous sympathy for Berub  I tried to do my part to oppose Horowitz and hanging out with the AAUPs Graham Larkin at Stanford is one of my more cherished memories  I cant help imagining myself in the position at the conservative. As Rick Perlstein (a mutual friend) has noted, sometimes the only friends the far-right can find are on the far-left. For I was once almost tossed out of class once for my political views (in that case, insisting that the US didnt attack Vietnam to fight the spread of Communism).
 
Berubs clear writing, intelligence, and thoroughgoing kindness made me want to hop the next flight to Pennsylvania and audit his classes. (Thankfully, he closes the book with two lengthy chapters summarizing two major courses that he teaches, somewhat saving me the trouble.) But had Berub been my teacher, would things have been different? One disagrees with Berub at ones own peril  his snark is sharp enough to take your head clean off  but having seen his dismissive blog commentary on leftists, I cant help but wonder.
 
His not-as-left-as-thou attitude carries over into the book as well. When conservatives attack a professor for claiming Israel is a racist state, Berub doesnt defend him but instead mocks the professors attempts to defend the comment. And when the discussion turns to students who are fans of Michael Parenti (are there any?), he foresees only two possibilities for their future: either they renounce Parenti or they dumb themselves down to his level. Im no fan of Parenti, but it takes an awful lot of confidence to say the only people who could agree with him are idiots.
 
Berub longs for intelligent conservatives that he can debate, but when it comes to intelligent leftists, he just wants to mock. But even if he treated them the same, Im not sure itd be much better. The I see where youre coming from, heres someone else who makes that argument trick  while eminently reasonable  is incredibly effective at robbing a young person of their moral indignation. It suggests that the question isnt one to be resolved, but simply one to be accepted as a fact of life: some people believe the Vietnam War was to fight Communism, others disagree. But when were talking about the lives of millions, such ambivalence is more frustrating than outright disagreement.
 
Berub discusses this too, in his penultimate chapter on postmodernism (a discussion of how he discusses topics by discussing the topic of discussion!). I cant say I was convinced by his positions in the Lyotard-Harbermas debate or the Rorty-Nagel one, but the discussion did spur me to more thoroughly codify my own. And really, isnt that what the liberal arts  at their best  are about? Whether through a combative debate with a partisan or a paternalistic moderation of the subject by a procedural liberal, any time a teacher gets a student to refine their views counts as a win in my book. The essential thing is that the question  and the position  be taken seriously.
 
More serious is the second question: what do we do about groupthink in the professoriate? Berub makes the convincing case that academias lack of conservatives is simply because it isnt a very good job for them. I know that if I was a young conservative, Id be riding the conservative gravy train instead of spending years in graduate school. The cost-benefit analysis isnt even close.
 
But clearly academia isnt completely infallible. How do you change the culture of a field when its gone off-course? Berubs suggestion is that you just play by the rules and stick to your principles. His example is the womens liberation movement, which succeeded in turning feminism into a real mode of literary criticism. But that seems like a somewhat atypical case.
 
What about economics departments, filled with professors whose theories neatly support right-wing social principles but rarely conform with any external evidence? What about psychology departments whose claims and experiments all-too-often make a mockery of the scientific method?
 
No self-respecting scientist would admit to being interested in an psuedoscience like psychology. If you tried (as I have) your friends would loudly mock you for it. And if that doesnt dissuade you, they start wondering if youre really as smart as they first thought. After all, why would anyone intelligent go into such a bogus field?
 
I certainly dont support an Academic Bill of Rights or any such nonsense  I want to improve academia, not destroy it. In fact, I dont have any great ideas for solving these problems. But I also dont think its fair to simply dismiss them, as Berub seems to. The self-reinforcing groupthink of academia is a problem; it prevents exactly the kind of critical sharpening that I argue is the best part of education. And as a structural problem, it would seem to require a structural change.
 
This is, to be clear, not the meat of Berubs book, which spends its first half mocking the conservative critique on academia and the second summarizing Berubs own classes. Indeed, I dont think the proposals Im responding to account for more than a couple paragraphs of the text. Nonetheless, those were the paragraphs that provoked my thoughts, so now Im defending them, just like a good student should.

To deal with: No self-respecting scientist would admit to being interested in an psuedoscience like psychology.
 
Just say youre interested in cognitive processing, or some such. Theres probably great advances to be found in applying whats been discovered from studying operating systems, to the human brain (e.g. obsessive-compulsive disorder is probably a broken scheduling algorithm, electroshock is almost literally rebooting, etc.)

Not sure I understand the context of Berubes point about feminism. Is he suggesting a more appropriate avenue for conservatives to increase their academic influence is via specialized programs akin to Womens Studies?

Hi Aaron,
 
Im with you until you get to the end of your second section.
 
Whether through a combative debate with a partisan or a paternalistic moderation of the subject by a procedural liberal, any time a teacher gets a student to refine their views counts as a win in my book.
 
This statement should be moderated (though not paternalistically).  Combative debates are fine, so long as they stay civil.  For instance, hearing Alan Dershowitz debate anyone does more to piss me off than refine my views.  His combination of supreme dismissive arrogance, counterfactual analysis, and weasely lawyerly gimmicks is enough to make even the so-called moderates whose positions he propounds cringe.
 
Equally annoying is the dismissal of liberals by mainstream center-left sources.  The oh those crazy liberals, what will they think up next logic that passes for incisive political and social analysis in this country is absurd, and is much more about dodging the real questions than getting anyone to refine his views.
 
I think instead of either pointing to sources supporting both sides or combative debate, the goal must be to really read those sources, critically analyze the situation, and hash these questions out in discussion that is neither angry nor patronizing.
 
The conservative cited in this case is most likely making a counterfactual argument (about the danger posed by Japanese-Americans), if he is  trying to justify internment, and so this case is easier than others, because even staunch conservatives who read more deeply about Japanese internment come away disgusted (this is a generalization, but has held true anecdotally in the 3-4 cases I know of).  In other cases, there are indeed excellent arguments on many sides, and the question is not so easy to resolve.  But in discussion, the emphasis should be on revealing fallacious reasoning, on critical thought, and on coming to some mutual understanding, not on proving a point absolutely.
 
But if the students views are changed because a) its not worth arguing if youll just be shouted over, or b) his position is mocked and he is made to doubt through appeals to authority, thats not good enough.  And if your scientist friends mock you for professing an interest in psychology, thats just as bad.  Lets look at the arguments, not the labels.

How do you change the culture of a field when 
  its gone off-course?
 
Interestingly, there have been two articles recently in the NYer about fields where groupthink and internal strife have been causing problems  and the surprise is that its in fields where objectivity would appear to be more attaintable than in, say, psych. One is mathematics, with infighting about who gets credit for (e.g.) working on Poincares conjecture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture). The other is theoretical physics, where (it is claimed) string theorists have dominated the field to the exclusion of possible competing theories, yet cannot seem (it is claimed) to turn theory into testable hypotheses.

Title: The Greatness of College Lectures
 
The other week I saw Scott McCloud give a presentation at a local college. Although he is not a professor himself, McCloud is a theorist of comics. Edward Tufte (among countless others) calls his guide Understanding Comics the best book on the medium. McCloud breaks comics down to its essential: the use of sequential art to tell a story  we see one thing, we see another, we imagine what happens in between. And watching McCloud speak, I realized that his talk was a vivid form of comics. The images werent just illustrations, they drove the story along, with McCloud simply filling in the words to connect them together.
 
After his talk, someone commented that McClouds presentation was the best hed ever seen. McCloud explained that there are two kinds of presentations: monkey bars, where a presenter swings from slide to slide, explaining each one in turn, and magic carpet rides, where the presenter simply keeps talking, confident the slides will appear underneath him to illustrate a point. McCloud gives a masterful magic carpet ride.
 
Tufte himself is professor emeritus at Yale. These days he goes on tour, rock-star style, teaching classes on presenting information. Tufte is a brilliant presenter  his energy keeps the audience spell-bound for an entire day. At one point, as I recall, he jumped up on a table and asked us to imagine the information density of various media as charted from one side of the room to the other. But what, I couldnt help but wonder, was the information density of this presentation? After all, hadnt he written four books on the subject? (Copies of which are given to each participant to take home.)
 
Then theres Lawrence Lessig, whos presentations are so powerful and influential that an entire style of presentation has been named after him. At his peak, I saw him give a talk at the OReilly Open Source Conference that had the audience, as Wes Felter put it, looking to start a riot afterwards. Lessigs rhythmic, almost hypnotic, presentation, invariably blows people away.
 
Does these peoples talks communicate more information than their books? I doubt it. But does a comic book communicate more information than a novel? No way. And yet McCloud (and Tufte) endorse it anyway. Its not because of the mediums informational density, its because of its emotional density. The same is true of these presentations.
 
Reading Lessigs books, youll probably learn more about the history of copyright law and the other things he discusses in his talk. But you wont feel his righteous indignation against those extremists on the right and left who are trying to distort its intentions and, in the process, hurt our culture.
 
Writing is quite effective at communicating facts, but to become a professional you need much more than a vast store of facts; you need to learn ways of thinking. These are what lectures, at their best, can provide. They show you how the speakers think about problems, how they feel about them, and, in doing so, provide a more fleshed-out notion than writing ever could.

Ive seen Lessig talk recently (at the Wizard of OS 04 in Berlin) and while I was impressed, I dont like this style.  Yes, it is captivating, entertaining, fast-paced, and so on.  However, there are two things it was not: Thought-provoking and memorable (content-wise).  There simply was not enough time for thought and there is too much flashy presentation for anything substantial to stick.  Additionally, he didnt present anything new.
 
A magic-carpet ride is fun.  Thats important but not enough for learning.

Scott McCloud actually has (now) a trilogy of books relating to his theories of comics: Understanding Comics, Reinventing Comics, and (his latest) Making Comics.  I recommend them all.  Each book is as masterful at handling its material as the first.
 
If you like this sort of thing, also try to get a copy of Visual Language, by Robert E. Horn (the man who brought Information Mapping to technical writing (not that it has ever garnered the appreciation it deserved in industry).
http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Language-Global-Communication-Century/dp/189263709X/sr=8-1/qid=1159977943/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-7935842-8613760?ie=UTF8&s=books
A great storehouse of examples of visual patterns for conveying information.

I downloaded the Lessig keynote at the Wizard of OS 2006 conference. Ive never seen somebody give a presentation like that before. I dont see that novelty of the content is an issue. Im not familiar with Lessigs ideas and I dont have a problem with promoting them again.

Ive not seen Tufte, McCloud or Lessig in the flesh, although I have read them.
 
But the presenter who really blew me away was Leroy Hood. This was before the days of presentation software and projector tied to computers. He used two Kodak Carousel machines, a remote in each hand, and gave a simply spell-binding explanation of how and why we could, if we wanted to, sequence the human genome. (It was that long ago.)
 
The thing that totally amazed me was not his lack of notes, that part is easy. It was that he was not simply alternating projectors. There would be a little run on one, then a the other, then back. I have no idea how he kept track.
 
Fantastic.

Title: The Awfulness of College Lectures
 
What do the children of privilege do when not engaging in conspicuous consumption while wearing fashionable clothes? Why attend class, of course! This bizarre, yet widespread, affectation seemed intriguing enough that I decided to pursue a further investigation in my inimitable first-person snob style.
 
The Harvard students sit patiently outside the lecture hall as they wait for the previous class to end. Many simply sit, but others, showing the go-get-it-ness that got them into Harvard, begin attempting conversation with their neighbors. The awkward situation shows through in the awkward conversation (which, no doubt, they will learn to smooth over as they get older) about superficial topics of schoolwork (never school content, of course).
 
As the previous class exits, we file in and take our seats. Gabbing continues somewhat for a while until, all of a sudden, as if by some mysterious consensus, it completely silences. The professor seems surprised too. Well, uh, it got quiet all of a sudden, he says haltingly, so I guess I better start talking. For a professor in social psychology, you think hed show a little more interest.
 
He begins the lecture in the standard way since PowerPoint: a title slide (with a cute illustration), a table of contents slide (which he walks through interminably slowly), and then a series of chunks of text and illustrations, which he walks through one by one. Its so bad it makes we want to tear my hair out. The content is largely superficial; the presentation is unnaturally slow. (We literally spend a good five minutes talking about a specific gross-out gag.)
 
But while this may be an extreme version of it, at its essence, this is the college lecture. Someone who (well give them the benefit of the doubt) is quite smart appearing stupid for fifty minutes so that they can communicate basic facts to kids at their level. Edward Tufte teaches us to always ask about the information density of a method of communication. The information communicated in this lecture could have fit on one side of a single piece of paper.
 
There was a camera in the back of the hall, presumably recording the proceedings. But had this been available online, I doubt I could have forced myself to watch it. (The other day someone asked me why more people dont watch the recordings of MIT lectures made available for free online. This is why.) The only reason the lecture is tolerable at all is because theres something captivating about being in the presence of another human being, regardless of what theyre saying. But it doesnt seem like that communicates anything additional  whether you see the guy in person or watch him at home, hes still saying the same stuff. And so when you watch him at home, theres just not much there.
 
So if what hes saying isnt very interesting, why do we subject ourselves to it? How did this become the primary method of education? Why do kids paid tens of thousands of dollars, in large part to fly someplace else to see someone say something they would have been bored to watch at home?
 
Back at Harvard, as I walk out of the class I hear the students gabbing. Wow, Im so glad I took this class, one says. That was the best lecture Ive ever been in.

Have you watched the MIT Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs lectures that were given to Hewlett Packard staff members some time in the 1980s?  Im interested to know if you think they are  exceptions to this rule or do you find them just as bad?  I really enjoyed (some of) them, although I watched them from the bath so there was little temptation to flick over to something else (the laptop would have got wet).  I couldnt quite get around to them out of the bath.  But Im glad I watched them.

While my experience is mostly with Dutch lectures (although Ive also attended courses at Wittenberg University for a year), most professors are just BAD. But there are a few exceptions. For example, Im currently in this Distributed Systems course with Maarten van Steen (a close colleague of Andrew Tanenbaum, of whom you mightve heard) and he is excellent. He engages the students, asks for lots of questions from class AND gets them, often rewards questions by telling the student that it is a good question, and generally shows a great amount of enthusiasm for his field of study.
 
But hes one of 2 or 3 professors who Ive encountered over 6 years of college that can do this. Most of them are just bad.

I truly hope you never, ever, ever subject yourself to working for Corporate America (tm), because the vast majority of communications and interactions have that same information densityand the same - if not worse - presentation values.  People with little to say, and saying it poorly.  People with much to say, but never saying it.  People who should never be allowed to interact with other human beings, talking interminably.
 
And remember: Friends dont let friends PowerPoint.

You are a snob, Aaron Swartz. You really are. ;) Then again, you are the only person I have ever seen use powerpoint well.
 
(By the way, is there a handy non-brandname word for such software as PowerPoint?)
 
While I agree with the general gnosis, there certainly are some profs who do more than waste your time. I had one math prof in particular who really got me to make a lot of connections that Im not sure I would have without some prompting. But then, he talked rapidly and never used slides.
 
And you must admit that in some areas, particularly music, art, foreign language, and skills such as martial arts, direct instruction from a master can really be of help. Perhaps its that these areas are at the farthest remove from the part of your brain that can read books. This reminds me of a certain lecture (I dont know any related books): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-533537336174204822&q=alan+kay
 
Man, if you think the class you sat in on was bad, let me tell you what you get at third-rate schools. I had an anthropology prof who did nothing but show videos all semester, two to four days a week. What videos? TV documentaries! Nova! National Geographic! 8th-grade reading level! No lower info density hath ever been known. I wrote a polite but biting letter to his department and got not even a form letter in return. And, like all lousy professors, he rigged the grading so that we had to attend to pass the class.
 
Speaking can potentially be such a very high-density channel that its a great pity that so few lecturers can do it well.
 
I gave a little talk at Wikimania and was very dissatisfied with it. I thought I did poorly. I wonder if you have any advice or resources or things to read to improve my presentation skills  this is a problem Id hate to be a part of.

David,
 
Before PowerPoint became the only choice, the generic term for such was presentation software.
Examples: http://microsoft.toddverbeek.com/present.html
 
As a former speech/theatre major, I can give a couple of recommendations for improving presentations.
 
Two books by Ron Hoff:
I Can See You Naked
and
Do Not Go Naked Into Your Next Presentation: Nifty Little Nuggets to Quiet the Nerves and Please the Crowd (Paperback)
 
The first book gives a fuller treatment (still very fun to read), but if you want the REALLY quick tips, go with the nifty little nuggets.
 
And then, go here and read the words of the master himself, Edward Tufte:

And even more fun, Aarons version of Tufte:

Title: Fashion Notes
 
It is Boston in the Fall, when school starts and the kids begin to pour in. Because I am a sad and lonely masochist, I have spent some sunny days walking among the tree-lined streets of the city, observing the happy, well-bred young people in their natural habitat. I have noticed that these children of the elite appear to have some patterns in their choice of clothing and thought that some of my more discerning readers might wish to know how they too can appear to be a hip young Harvard student.
 
Girls: Wear a tight bright shirt with a large neck and half-length sleeves on top of tight light blue jeans.
 
Guys: Wear tight brown hoodies over a dark T-shirt on top of semi-tight dark blue jeans.
 
That is all.

Title: Life in the Hospital
 
An extra-special guest post hoisted from comments!
 
The very walls of the hospital seemed to suck the life out of mepainted in puke yellowand the window, which did look out at some trees, unfortunately framed a weeks worth of grey, rainy weather.  The floors and walls were filthy (I wont even mention the bathroom); the furniture old, chipped and stained; the framed artwork (like an old puzzle drawing out of Boys Life magazine with faces and animals and broomsticks hiding in the trees) faded; the food rancid, stinky and inedibly heavy and overly sweet.  I seldom saw the doctors wash their hands or use the Purell dispenser on the wall (I began to fear catching some super hospital germ infection).  When I could finally walk the halls in my hideous hospital gowns and infantilizing slipper socks, I was tethered to a top-heavy pole with bad wheels, which made dragging it over any bumps or turning corners an exercise in futility.  I begged to be let out, to be sent home where it was clean, where I could have simple healthy food and take a shower; I begged the residents, the doctors (when they came on rounds) to take the tubes out of me.  And they just made me feel idiotic, patronized, weak and helpless.
 
Finally, in the middle of one sleepless, endless night spent staring at the walls, being sure the clock was actually moving backwards, it occurred to me with perfect clarity that the patient is never going to win the battle with the doctorsbecause the doctors have all the weapons.  Just then the door slammed open, yet another nurse threw on all the lights and jabbed me with a needle, filling me with some other substance she refused to identify.  Oh god, it was the most horrible hospital experience I have ever been through.  And the scariest part of it is that this hospital is on the list of the 100 Best Hospitals in Illinois.  Imagine what the others not on the list are like.
 
[]
 
My brother has a theory.  You go into a hospital to have something fixed but they immediately take you totally out of your normal environment:  off your normal food and caffeine, off all your regular medications, etc.  They do the surgery  (or whatever) and invade your body with all sorts of foreign substances (IVs, narcotics, oxygen, TPNs, blood thinners, insulin, etc.)  Then, as they gradually withdraw the foreign substances they have assaulted you with, they declare you cured.  Then you are eventually allowed to go back home and resume your normal routine.  Odd.

Esteeemed Aaroni just read the story by Jessica G..and thought about the last couple of paragraphs, the ones about anxiety, guilt, and also about the fancy car/house in burbs/cool kids.
Man, those are just what Other People say are the things to demonstrate your arrivedness.. 
(I talk back to the damn newspaperthen I pick up my pen, er, sorry, boot up my dial-up slowmotion macintosh machine, and start typing..)
Originality is the name of the game
I wanted to tell you this.
WHen I read about the im so shy i thought: Hmmm, sounds like my husband. This guy is going to catch some hell for protecting his boundaries
Then I told myself to write to you, and say
Keep Being Original.
And if you dont mind being shy, then theres no problem.
Heres my little baby blog (I only recently got one set up because I dont play w/computers much, someone else had to do it for me because Im massively techno-lazy), more like a page on a website:
Just exactly who is Jacquie Phelan? What makes her tick? One persons strategy for survival in a revved up world.
 
I was born to enthusiastic lovers, but reluctant parents. I never grew up, because because grown-up has groan in it. My early years were spent mastering the miniature tea set ceremony, reading Nancy Drew, and catching frogs. We moved a lot, from Rhode Island, to Kansas, to Tarzana, a planet that orbits Los Angeles, California.
 
I learned to ride a bicycle in Topeka at age 9, and it wasnt easy. I was on Moms huge bike. Let me learn this I bargained with God, and Ill never ask for anything again. It turns out I lied to God. Riding a too-big bicycle turned out to be easy, compared with babysitting five younger siblings. I ran away a lot, just to get out of the house. I prayed for admittance to a college as far from Los Angeles as possible. I got my wish, and attended Middlebury, a college that usually knows better than to accept my ilk. Now I owe God two favors.
 
At Midd, I was a San Fernando Valley Girl in Vermonts dairy country, and swam naked as much as possible on the two warm days that inevitably occurred during finals week. I was an OK scholar, but a great host to my friends who came by for waffles on Sunday in my dorm room. I made snow sculptures for laughs and collected beer cans for cash. I got disciplined for speaking French in sociology class, and socializing in French class.
 
After graduation, I did not apply to medical school: this would prove to be my first concrete contribution to the betterment of humanity. Moving to San Francisco changed my life; its a town an ordinary human can circumnavigate in a day by bicycle. LA cannot be circumnavigated by bike; by the time you complete a lap, theres more city added.
 
I decided to become famous. For a Tarzana kid, its ridiculously easy: glue a toy duck on your bike helmet, and ride a minimum of 15 miles a day in heavy urban traffic. Fame will be yours in a month. This home-grown fame has little resemblance to the glitzy big screen recipe. For one thing, its a lot healthier, less toxic. It never runs away from you. If you dont like it, you tear the duck off the helmet. Youll never suffer strangers who walk up to you and start talking like they know you. Your secret will be safe. So, why did I take up bike racing? Especially off-road bike racing, when its always on the road that Im riding? The only people they notice racing bikes are men. Ah, yes, but there are other reasons to ride than fame, and racing isnt the only way to ride a bike. I biked San Francisco streets for survival. Financial survival. Its just plain cheap to ride everywhere, compared to Muni, or owning a car that you cant find a parking spot for.
 
But this survival plan wasnt very well thought-out. It began years earlier as an anti-plan, hatched half-consciously when a health teacher at my high school pointed out how we would divide up our efforts as consumers of the future. Health was the LA City School Systems answer to sex education. Mr. Vadetsky was a very right-on guy, pretty nice, he seemed fair. Hed show us vivid anti-drug movies, and try to stifle the snickering that implied that probably half the class was stoned that morning. One day, to illustrate our use of time and resources, he drew a sort of peace sign on the blackboard. More like a luxury car logo, actually.
 
Three equal segments. If you think school is a bore he intoned, adulthood has a few surprises in store for you. Like how hard it is just to keep your head above water, to survive financially. This classroom didnt have any kids who worried about financial survival.
 
Heres how much time youll spend on earning the money to buy and maintain a car and he shaded in one third of the pie.
 
Heres how much time and work goes into purchasing a home Another third of the pie took a dose of chalk.
 
And this last third, thats for sleep, recreation, and leisure time.
 
It was a pretty scrawny slice. I raised my hand. If you rode a bike, and rented your apartment instead of bought a house, would that give you a bigger hunk of the pie? How would you like to visit the vice-principals office? He was joking. Mr. V always counted on me to have the off-camber opinion. So here we are now, nearly a lifetime later, with me pigged out on all the pie I could possibly eat, trying to figure out about the other two thirds. Since I dont know the answer to the question, Is it better to take your retirement when youre young and fit, risking a lifetime of marginal survival, or after youve got financial security, like probably after youre 65?
 
Thanks to WOMBATS, and my ability to jot down a thought or two, Ive managed to share some of that pie-saving strategy with many thousands of people, women and men, but mostly women since they are better listeners. If just a handful of women take control of their right to hog a little of the fun pie, and then show their friends how they did it, then I can rest easy that Ive done a better job than I would have traveling the road I was expected to take.

Title: Take the Easy Way Out
 
When I was a kid, people were always telling me that there was no substitute for hard work. If I wanted to be smart, I had to sit and force myself to read hard books. If I wanted to lose weight, I had to force myself to exercise. If I wanted to play piano, I had to force myself away from the computer to practice. Cheating, they explained, would only cheat myself in the end.
 
And yet today I eagerly ran to the library to grab five large books (and return seven more), felt an itch to go jogging, and walked away from web surfing so I could go practice a musical instrument. The adults were completely wrong.
 
Your bodys resistance to an activity isnt an obstacle to be overcome, its a message that youre being an idiot, just like when your hand hurts after you punch a wall. The right solution isnt to start punching the wall harder, its to look around for a tool to help you do the job.
 
In the case of books, the key is that you need to be sure to read books that are at your level. If you read books about subjects you dont know enough to understand or that use a dialect youre not familiar with, its going to be hard and its going to be a waste of time. With losing weight, the key is things like the Shangri-La Diet. And with learning an instrument, the key is using Bemani games that actually make music fun.
 
Ive discussed the other two in other places, but why do Bemani games work? First, youre playing real music. Normally when you play piano, you have to start on baby songs which are both infantilizing and uninteresting, with real music not even on the horizon. Bemani games start you on real songs from the beginning. Since the reason many people get excited about musical instruments in the first place is the chance to play their favorite song, this is a pretty compelling difference. And the fact that the computer simplifies the song and fills in the notes you dont play for you makes it possible.
 
Second, Bemani games provide clear additional results in proportion to additional effort. This is what makes them so much fun. I dont know about the real science, but in Barbara Ehrenreichs novel Kippers Game the plot revolves around some research showing that games like that stimulate the pleasure centers of the brain. You get the high of achievement, but it quickly wears off as you get used to your new skill level, and so you want to do better so you can get another high.
 
This is also what makes these games so educational. Research on experts has found such immediate feedback is essential to learning, calling the general process deliberate practice. In deliberate practice, subjects should receive immediate informative feedback and knowledge of results of their performance. The subjects should repeatedly perform the same or similar tasks. When these conditions are met, practice improves accuracy and speed of performance on cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks (Fitts & Posner, 1967; Gibson, 1969; Welford, 1968). (K. Anders Ericsson, et. al, The Role of Deliberate Practice, Psychological Review) Your attempts arent random  its very clear what works and what doesnt and you can adjust your strategies accordingly.
 
Third, you can do them in small chunks. When you normally play an instrument, if you hit a wrong note you often keep trying until you get it right. But with Bemani games, the music just keeps marching on without you. This might at first seem a disadvantage, but it means you dont get hung up on a mistake, each attempt takes at most as long the song does. With real music, if you hit a difficult part of the song you can easily get stuck trying over and over to get it right, before getting frustrated and giving up on the whole thing. Keeping the music moving forces you to look at the bigger picture.
 
The flip side of this is that playing the games gives you a continuous sense of motion and progress. In the mid-1980s  the heyday of video game research  some psychologists were trying to find out what video games quite so much fun. They took the classic Wozniak/Atari game Breakout and started removing components to see if kids stopped playing it. What they found was you could remove just about everything  the levels, the score, the bouncing off the paddle  everything except for the animations of the bricks disappearing. It was making the bricks disappear, somehow, that made the game fun. (Mind at Play, Loftus and Loftus)
 
I doubt Bemani games were made with these kind of principles in mind  considering the history, it was probably just a coincidence. But it shows that you could have created Bemani from them. All you needed to do was pay attention to the fact that learning an instrument was frustrating and tried to eliminate the frustrating part. Good designers, when they see people having trouble using something they designed, dont tell the user to try harder. They fix the design. We should take the same attitude when we design our life as well.

I know what you mean about the baby songs. However, I switched to a songbook that started with simplified classical music, which is much more interesting. It only took a few weeks before I was playing sections of Bach. On the other hand, what I really want to know is jazz improvision, but nobody seems to teach that to beginners.
 
Anyways, not getting stuck on parts is just a matter of not letting yourself stop. I learned this while learning the drum set; Mistakes are fills was the idea.
 
I havent played any Bemania games, though (except for DDR, once, but lets not go into that). Maybe theres something to em. I like your perspective overall.
 
Lastly, we just need to find something of this kind for things like writing college applications.

The concept of deliberative practice and its effect on learning makes one wonder why so much of our educational system is based around rare feedback events e.g. only the final exams mattering in a class.
 
I knew I liked weekly quizzes for a reason :)

The right is in the middle, its true that for learning a thing you have to like it, and you have to build a correct strategy, but theres a risk that doing what you like you forget to do what you must, this last thing is the work. For this i think that the right is in the middle, to make all type of experience make a open mind, but you cant educate a kid only making what he like. This is my opinion, id like replies and disaccording. Good idea the Bemani Games!

Title: A Unified Theory of Magazines
 
For as long as Ive been building web apps, its been apparent that most successful websites are communities  not just interactive pages, but places where groups of like-minded people can congregate and do things together. Our knowledge of how to make and cultivate communities is still at a very early stage, but most agree on their importance.
 
A magazine, we may imagine, is like a one-way web site. It doesnt really allow the readers to talk back (with the small exception of the letters page), it doesnt even have any sort of interactivity. But I still think communities are the key for magazines; the difference is that magazines export communities.
 
In other words, instead of providing a place for a group of like-minded people to come together, magazines provide a sampling of what a group of like-minded people might say in such an instance so that you can pretend youre part of them. Go down the list and youll see.
 
The magazines of Cond Nast, for example, export lifestyles. Most readers probably arent the hip scene the magazines supposedly cover, but by reading these things they learn what to wear and what to buy and what these people are talking about. Even their high-brow magazines, like the New Yorker, serve the same purpose, only this time its books instead of clothes.
 
The late, great Lingua Franca exported the university. Academephiles, sitting at home, probably taking care of the kids, read it so they could imagine themselves part of the life of the mind. Similarly, the new SEED magazine is trying to export the culture of science, so people who arent themselves scientists can get a piece of the lab coat life.
 
Alumni magazines similarly export college life, so that graying former college students can relive some of their old glory days, reading pieces about library renovations as they recall having sex in the stacks. And house organs export a particular kind of politics, telling you what a party or organizations take is on the issues of the day, giving you a sense of the party line.
 
Run down the list and in pretty much every case you scratch a magazine, you find an exported community. Magazines that want to succeed will have to find one of their own.

And then theres Readers Digest, which tells people how to psychologically abuse their children, what pseudoscience to believe in, and what to be gripped with the terror of. I flip through it sometimes out of morbid curiosity. But what community does it export exactly?
 
And the (rather useless) Linux Journal. It exports being a sys admin?

Title: A Feminist Goes to the Hospital
 
In A Pattern Language, Christopher Alexander comments on the idiocy of
trying to nurse people to health by locking them up in the land of the
sick, but a visit to an actual hospital makes the point more vividly
than logical argument ever could. The modern hospital is a place of
nightmares, even visiting I cannot manage to spend more than an hour
here without beginning to go insane. I cannot imagine how anyone ever
escapes.
 
An island of white in an ocean of green, the modern hospitals
landscaping dangles the promise of verdant beauty while its insides are
all white sterility. The hallways of identical doors twist and turn
around so much that its impossible to find any room that isnt
carefully numbered, even after several attempts to try to discern the
buildings layout. The muted colors and dreary duplication do not reward
such attempts at investigation, or even mere attempts at life.
 
It seems like the building itself is ill. Odd pieces are blocked off
with white sheets, larger ones with completely opaque walls. Bizarre
machines with large tubes line the hallways, apparently standing in for
broken parts of the buildings innards, while workmen wander around
attempting to treat the other symptoms.
 
The rooms themselves are monstrous cells, tiny boxes with doors that
stay open and walls that fight any attempts at individuality or privacy.
The size makes entertaining guests awkward, while the lack of activities
makes loneliness unbearable.
 
Were the large sign reading Hospital to go missing, one might easily
mistake the facility as one for torture: men whose clothes have been
replaced by dreary gowns slowly wander the halls in dreary stupor, their
battered faces making them appear as if they have been badly beaten.
They are not permitted to escape.
 
Were one, under such amazing conditions, to try to mount an attempt at
fruitful work, it would quickly fail. Even assuming one was able to
muster the energy to focus, the noises through the thin walls and
unclosed doors would quickly distract. The beeps and buzzes from the
assorted machinery would frustrate to no end. The screeching
announcements from the loudspeakers would fast derail any trains of
thought. And if one manages to get past all these things, well, it will
only be a short while until a nurse or orderly comes to insert another
needle or run some other humiliating and invasive task.
 
And so one simply watches the seconds tick away, as in some odd form of
Chinese water torture. Sometimes the pain is made more vivid by the
combination of very real physical discomfort, which incapacity makes
difficult to alleviate. Itchiness, dirtiness, and restlessness are the
orders of the day, with powerlessness coming in to make sure the others
dont escape.
 
Ostensibly this place is meant to cure things, the unimpeachable
knowledge of science and the clean sterility of the building meant to
combine to induce health. But, as before in history, the cure may be
worse than the disease. Robert Karen has documented how early concerns
about antisepsis led hospitals to keep children far away
from their parents. The result, as was plain to anyone paying attention,
was severe psychological trauma for the children, who assumed their
parents had abandoned them, leading to mental problems that last a
lifetime.
 
While modern hospitals induce problems apparently less severe, they are
still problems. Again, the doctors that are supposed to help the
patients seem less concerned about the patients as people than 
bodies, things to be measured and operated upon, puzzles to solve,
problems to fix. They do not tell the patient what is being done to
them, do not reap the benefits that could be received by engaging them
in the search for the solution, but instead only share knowledge when
forced by law and precedent, preferring to keep the real details private
among the priesthood of doctors and nurses.
 
Barbara Ehrenreich and Deidre English note how well-off women of the
pre-feminist era suffered from mysterious symptoms of inactivity, a
condition they diagnose as the psychological result of their inactivity
and powerlessness; society entrusted them with no responsibility and
so their minds collapsed from lack of active use.
 
While women have made great strides in the years since, for many the
problem is still quite real. And laid up in a hospital, with domestic
and childrearing tasks undoable, they may find the responsibilities they
had fade away, their condition stripped back to that of their afflicted
forebearers.
 
And so patriarchical society and patriarchical medicine combine to strip
all vestiges of humanity away. No freedom, no responsibility; no
movements, no tasks; no privacy, no thought. The person becomes the body
that the doctors treat them as.
 
Friends and family may try to visit, in an attempt to bring a bit of
their outside world into this sterile place, but the awkward situation
strains even the best relationships. Friendly conversations become hard
when one party is lying in bed moaning, while strained family
relationships are stretched further, surfacing their most disgustingly
dysfunctional aspects. Family members, whatever else they may
accomplish, somehow learn the remarkable skill of knowing just what to
do to drive you up the wall. And as the hospital environment (along with
the psychological stress of seeing you trapped in it) drives them insane
as well, their presence quickly becomes more curse than blessing.
 
Ive never seen an environment so effective at inducing such severe
psychological pain. After just an hour, I feel like screaming, tearing,
pounding, killing. I go out of my mind and yearn to get out of my body
as well, running around in circles, pounding against the floor, with not
even exhaustion appearing to cure me.
 
It neednt be this way, for there is a cure: the joy of life. Sanity can
be restored through attempts at music, channeling the fundamental
disorder into form and elegance, focusing the energy toward good. Art,
especially the art of nature, as Alexander suggested, is likely another
cure. But hospitals arent built for that.

I recovered from an emergency appendectomy in a hospital much as you describe.  I felt like clawing at the walls the whole time.  A recent stay with my little boy in Portlands Doernbecher Childrens Hospital revealed that not all hospitals are so.  Nevertheless no hospital is a replacement for home.  In Spiritual Midwifery Ina May Gaskin shows how much better midwifery serves mothers and newborns in a home setting. The book is a wild read with a description of a child (Ira) born without a skull.  The sad part of Iras story though is that after they rushed him to the hospital the nurses and doctors there chose not to feed him since the condition was fatal.

hey Aaron
 
Howard Zinn also gives a good overview of the severely depressing ennui felt by pre-feminist era women, in A Peoples History. It wasnt until some women created ad-hoc, underground support groups for themselves that they began to realize they werent alone in their symptoms the boredom, the spontaneous crying, the emptiness. I think these support groups in turn formed the foundation of the movement.

An architect friend in Chiapas, Mexico, Kees Grootenboer, has recently created an amazing hospital in Altamirano, Chiapas.  The San Carlos clinic, which mostly services rural peasants from nearby municipalities, and is staffed by nuns, has quite a constrained budget, and the construction is of local materials.  The construction cost was quite low, and the building uses several interesting techniques to minimize energy consumption.
 
But the amazing thing about the hospital is its feel.  Unlike any other hospital Ive ever visited, its exterior walls are bright blues and yellows.  Rooms have large windows which look out on green spaces.  Walls are round and there are few corners in sight.  The result is truly incredible.  Im sorry their website (designed by my 20 yr. old friend Gamaliel Grootenboer), hasnt been put online yet, as it has some nice photos.
 
Obviously, the constraints are completely different than those in large cities where horizontal space is at a premium, and hospitals need to be 20 stories tall and fit into rectangular shapes.  But we could definitely do more to make our hospitals places that evoke life and movement, instead of cold white sterility.

The term hospital was, infact, initially used for houses where the poor, the insane, the criminal and the sick were collected, out of the sight and out of the mind of decent people. From this prisons, asylums, and hospitals in the modern sense were later developed, following a similar pattern of surveillance as a design principle. But also schools were developed following this pattern, once the effects of such surveillance were discovered. This development is studied IIRC in Discipline and Punish by Michel Foucault, and at least the Foucault Reader has some relevant excerpts.

Thanks my dear Aaron,
For flying in to be with me (it was the one shining moment of my hospital stay when I looked up and saw the unexpected surprise of you coming into the room) and for staying all week despite the horribly pervasive atmosphere of that hospital.
 
I began to refer to it as The Dead Zone.   I was in for 6 days after an emergency surgery and seemed only to get more ill as time went on (part of I blame on the nutrition zealot doctor who deemed I needed intravenous nutrition packetsTPNswhich required inserting a PICC line and testing my blood sugar 6 times a day and giving me insulin shotswhich I have never neededto balance out the sugars in the TPNs), I sank into a depression so unexpected that by the 5th day I was sure that I had already died and the hospital was the level of hell to which I had been permanently consigned.  I pathetically begged everyone who entered the room, Its all rightyou can tell meIm dead already, arent I?
 
The very walls of the hospital seemed to suck the life out of mepainted in puke yellowand the window, which did look out at some trees, unfortunately framed a weeks worth of grey, rainy weather.  The floors and walls were filthy (I wont even mention the bathroom); the furniture old, chipped and stained; the framed artwork (like an old puzzle drawing out of Boys Life magazine with faces and animals and broomsticks hiding in the trees) faded; the food rancid, stinky and inedibly heavy and overly sweet.  I seldom saw the doctors wash their hands or use the Purell dispenser on the wall (I began to fear catching some super hospital germ infection).  When I could finally walk the halls in my hideous hospital gowns and infantilizing slipper socks, I was tethered to a top-heavy pole with bad wheels, which made dragging it over any bumps or turning corners an exercise in futility.  I begged to be let out, to be sent home where it was clean, where I could have simple healthy food and take a shower; I begged the residents, the doctors (when they came on rounds) to take the tubes out of me.  And they just made me feel idiotic, patronized, weak and helpless.
 
Finally, in the middle of one sleepless, endless night spent staring at the walls, being sure the clock was actually moving backwards, it occurred to me with perfect clarity that the patient is never going to win the battle with the doctorsbecause the doctors have all the weapons.  Just then the door slammed open, yet another nurse threw on all the lights and jabbed me with a needle, filling me with some other substance she refused to identify.  Oh god, it was the most horrible hospital experience I have ever been through.  And the scariest part of it is that this hospital is on the list of the 100 Best Hospitals in Illinois.  Imagine what the others not on the list are like.
 
I know the hospital atmosphere adversely affected my family and yet they were kind enough to visit me every day; Aaron slept over in my room one night.  It was hard for them all sitting there in that horrible place, trying to think of things to talk about, trying to help.  I know I was cranky and not very easy to deal with, hardly a scintillating conversationalist.  And yet, when they left at night, I would cry, so afraid to be alone in the hospital, so afraid of what the staff could do to me in the night when I was unprotected.  These are modern times; this is a modern hospital.  Im only in my 50s and Im not insanehow much worse must this experience be for an older person?  How much more terrified must they be by all the impersonal interventions that happen to them in a hospital, with explanations (when they are explained) that they cant understand?  Or how is it for children for that matter, though, luckily, times have changed and parents can stay with their children now pretty much around the clock.
 
My brother has a theory.  You go into a hospital to have something fixed but they immediately take you totally out of your normal environment:  off your normal food and caffeine, off all your regular medications, etc.  They do the surgery  (or whatever) and invade your body with all sorts of foreign substances (IVs, narcotics, oxygen, TPNs, blood thinners, insulin, etc.)  Then, as they gradually withdraw the foreign substances they have assaulted you with, they declare you cured.  Then you are eventually allowed to go back home and resume your normal routine.  Odd.

Its true that not all hospitals are this bad but most of them are. A few weeks ago I had to spend 8 hours in the Philadelphia hospital when my dad was undergoing a procedure on his heart.
 
It was remarkably comfortable it was the first time I ever ventured deep into a hospital successfully just by reading the signs, never having to ask for help. Everything was well lit, well-marked, colorful and bright. There were other touches  my dad had a private room with a large bathroom, even though he didnt request one (it was standard); he had a window; there were comfy benches out in many of the hallways, the people (even orderlies and maintenance) were friendly. One of the nurses even gave me her cell phone number in case I got lost getting back out of Philly (I got lost coming in). There were computers with internet access in the waiting room! The food in the cafe was also almost on the level of a casual dining place like Quiznos or Panera.
 
And, best of all, the guys doing the work on him came out from time to time to let me know how it was going, because it was taking sooo very long. I appreciated that most of all (that, and the internet!).
 
It was still torture but so much less so than any other experience Ive had with hospitals.
 
My father and I both felt more secure even before the operation, and much better afterwards, than the previous time in Harrisburg. I would bet that a hospital like that one has a better recovery/success rate than others. There are probably studies somewhere, but itd be hard to adjust for other variables.

Reading your article brought back bad memories of my grandfathers stay at the hospital. The doctor made a diagnosis: heart attack. We were all shocked! There were no symptoms, hes never had any heart problems. He was an elderly, and yet strong and healthy man. He was put into a ward with 3 other men and told he had to stay there for a few more days. I know it sounds terrible, but I had to force myself to visit him. I simply hate hospitals. Whenever I get inside I become pale and feel nauseous. I cannot stand that repulsive smell of sickness, all these sounds of people suffering not only from different kinds of diseases but also loneliness and powerlessness. When I saw my grandpa that day, I didnt notice that strong and healthy man that he appeared to be any more. I saw a woeful, life-tired man, surrounded by wires, tubes and machines, who couldnt move without doctors permission. He had to share a room with other moaning men, who seemed to be much older and left by the relatives to their own fate.
 
Within one minute a person whom Ive known all my life, suddenly became so distant. I was speechless. But what struck me the most, was the moment the doctor informed him that he had to stay in the hospital over Easter. My grandfather, a 75  year old man cried like a baby! How desperate and miserable he had to be to weep in front of the whole family, not to mention the staff and other patients. He begged us to take him home, not because of Easter, no. Because he felt worse and worse behind these walls, instead of recovering. He said: Id rather die at home than stay in this place a minute longer. We took him home the same day, although the doctor disapproved of our decision.
 
Now, when my grandpa has fully recovered and feels fine, I know that it was a very good decision. I also know that when it comes to hospitals, it is sometimes much better to listen to your heart, not the voice of reason.

Reading your post put me in mind of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, whose bout with post-partum depression eventually became the very influential short story ?The Yellow-Wallpaper.?  For one thing, your prose is every bit as evocative.  For another, your essay, like her story, concerns the very real mental damage that ?cures? can often cause for their ?patients.?  But perhaps most telling was your brief section on the situation of women in relation to hospitals.  When my daughter was born, my wife developed heart complications.  As a result, shortly after the C-section birth, she was moved to the heart ward.  I stayed with her for the week she remained afterwards, and I would describe very little of the experience as conducive to becoming well (and I wasn?t even the one who was sick).  In addition to the fact that nurses come in at all hours of the night to wake you up (isn?t sleep important to recovery?), the first several night nurses had no idea my wife had given birth and kept asking her if the bloody bandages were the result of her period.  But the best of all was the fact that infants are only allowed to stay in the hospital four days.  So, while my wife had to continue to lie in bed recovering from surgery and watching her heart blip on a monitor, we had to send our four-day old daughter home to her grandparents.

You guys are a bunch of paranoid idiots  If you could step in the shoes of a physician just for one day, you would realize how much good is done in such places.  The overwhelming majority of physicians and nurses are intelligent, compassionate individuals who give it their all to care for others.  Hospital-buildings themselves are often not much to look at, however, thats not what really matters most, is it?

Wow. I saw one intelligent reply from a doctor here, the rest of you are elitist fear mongerers (I love writing garbage like this!).  Anyway, heres a good option to avoid the woes of our modern health care systemDONT USE IT!  There are hundreds of millions of people that would kill for their child to be traumatized by our burn centers, or themselves driven up the wall by our oncology wards.
 
You people (I use that term loosely) need to eat more red meat and join the team.  Or, quit your job, move to the Arizona desert, build an earthsip, convert to Christian Science (no doctors or hospitals), and live the dream!  The fact of the matter is this:  We are quickly being overtaken as the best in just about everything thats measurable.  So, look at third world health care and relish in the fact that we will have that in about 40 years along with the decline of our wealth and society.  At that time, all of you can yell hooray, no more invasive surgeries in drab, depressing hospitals as you brush the flies away from the eyes of your suffering child.  Yay!!!

I nearly died in a high-speed rollover near Palm Spring CA. I did die actually. Several times. This near death brought me to Desert Springs Trauma Center, where because of wonderful doctors and nurses, Im still in this dimension.
 
My body was horrible trashed - badly broken back (T3,5,7 burst fractures) and my face was partially pulverized.
 
I hated that I had to be there, but thank goodness thats where I was! I love and appreciate everyone who cared for me - the doctors and nurses are extremely overworked, esp. with shitty paperwork. They are very caring and wonderful human beings.
 
Of course no one wants to be in a hospital, but if you ever need one, youll think differently about them perhaps.
 
Sure there are ways they could be better, I could list a few from a patients point of view who was incapacitated there for several months, but unless a benevolent benefactor gives them alot of money, frills like artwork, though healing and inspiring, just cant be in most hospitals.
 
aloha and again, thank you to the paramedics, nurses and doctors!

Well being from third world country, i can only laugh at people meaning the world and quality of life on basis on GDP per capita. While i dont want to tell you the secrets of an argicultrual country with less capital sitting in banks, what is nice in eastern countries is relatives and people who come into picture when one is ill. Reletatives travel to another cities just to see the patients and spend time with them while they are in hospitals.
 
We all going to die either first world or third world. But your life in first world countries is pathetic and people are mentally sick (talking out of first hand personal expereince of first world countries). just like a comment before, a small town had a better hospital.

Title: Alone in the Hospital
 
Going to the hospital has never been particularly safe, but hospitals have tried to do what they can. In the early part of the 1900s, hospitals became fanatical about sterility, to prevent infection. Each infant in their care, for example, had its own white coat for doctors to wear as they visited that infant, hung on hooks inside out for the next doctor to don. Holding babies was considered dangerous (as signage emphasized), so they were fed without being held  bottles were simply propped up where the infants could get at them. Needless to say, parents were denied visits.
 
And yet mortality rates for infants in hospital care ranged from 30 to 75 percent. The babies were cared for and nourished, they had no outward physical problems, they simply succumbed to a mysterious phenomenon the doctors labeled failure to thrive. Some thought it might be a hidden infection.
 
So the nurses wore masks and hoods, carefully scrubbed up before they handled infants. Some hospitals put infants in boxes with glove-valves  the kinds you see in movies when scientists are handling radioactive material  so that theyd never have to touch the infant at all. But the problem just got worse.
 
Henry Bakwin, pediatric director of New Yorks Bellevue Hospital, saw this and thought that perhaps they were going about things exactly wrong. The infants werent dying of infection, he believed, they were dying of loneliness  a loneliness that made it easier for them to succumb to infection. He took down the signs about washing hands and put up signs requiring everyone to pick up and fondle a baby. And infection rates went down.
 
Harold Skeels and a team at the Iowa Child Research Welfare Station decided to try an experiment. They took thirteen girls out of institutionalized care and had them adopted by older girls in a home for the feeble-minded. Within nineteen months, the average IQs of the adopted kids jumped from 64 to 92.
 
But these folks were the radicals. The mainstream scientific community refused to believe there was anything wrong  people were blowing things out of proportion, they insisted, and anyway, everyone knows children that young cant suffer from depression. The studies were flawed.
 
John Bowlby came at it from a different perspective. Interviewing severely disturbed kids, he discovered they all shared a traumatic separation from their parents when they were young. He concluded the mother-infant relationship was essential to development and issued recommendations much like Skeels and Spitz. The mothering of a child is not something which can be arranged by roster, he wrote in reports for the World Health Organization. But still the hospitals didnt change.
 
Bowlbys student John Robertson begun doing observation at hospitals. He noticed that babies screamed painfully as they were admitted. The nurses explained that this was normal and theyd soon settle down. He noticed that these settled babies returned to violent fits when they were taken home, attacking her as if they blamed her. The nurses said that was normal too, mothers werent just as good at taking care of kids as the nurses. Robertson had a different explanation.
 
He decided to make a movie to prove it. Unlike the last, this one would be completely scientific. He would pick a name at random from the list of babies, then always film them at a specific hour, clock in the background, so you could tell he wasnt cheating. The name he picked was Laura.
 
When he went to find her he was devastated: Laura was the one girl in a hundred who wasnt crying; her parents had reared her so strictly that she quietly restrained all her emotions. I saw immediately [she] was going to be the one child in a hundred who was not going to demonstrate what I had been shouting my head off [about], Robertson said. But he couldnt pick another child  that would be cheating. The project continued.
 
The first day, Laura jumped out of her bath to the door in an attempt to escape. Her smiles disappear and sometimes she quietly sobs while clutching her teddy. Wheres my mummy? she asks repeatedly, while trying hard to hold back tears. Each day she grows grayer until on the fifth, when she appears unsmiling and resentful. Her mother comes to visit (thanks to a special exception to the rules Robertson negotiated), but she wipes away her mothers kiss. When her mother waves goodbye, she looks away. When her mother finally comes to take her home on the eight day, she begins shaking with sobs. She gathers up all of her stuff, but refuses to take her mothers hand as they walk out.
 
They presented the film to the Royal Society of Medicine in London. The audience was outraged. It was false, it was slander, it was a trick, it was an atypical child, it was filmed selectively, it was edited dishonestly. People stood up and said that their childrens wards were not like that, two-year-olds were all happy, Robertson recalls. Robertson was banned from some of the wards he was observing, pediatricians walked across the street when they encountered him. The hospital claimed that Robertson had interfered with the nurses trying to care for Laura. As Robertson toured Britain with the film, the reaction was always the same.
 
When Laura finally saw the film, six months later, she burst into tears. Where were you all that time? she asked her mother.
 
Reviews in the medical journals, however, were all positive. And younger nurses and doctors begun telling Robertson how they agreed with him and would do things differently, if only they were in charge. And a few higher-ups quietly sent some votes of support. So Robertson kept going. He took the film to the United States, hoping for a similarly positive reception. But the Americans insisted that while it was a great film about Britain, it had no relevance in their country. And nobody was willing to take the obvious step of letting mothers stay with their children on the wards.
 
Not until 1955 were there signs of change. Fred Stone, a doctor at the Royal Hospital in Glasgow, decided to do a pilot study. I would drive up the hill to come here, he recalled, and there would be two hundred parents queueing up in the rain to get in for their half hours visiting. A colleague who had control of two pediatric wards decided to offer one of them to Stone to prove that his suggestions wouldnt work.
 
When the nurses heard about this, they threatened to resign together. To placate them, Stone set up a series of meetings. The aggression after the first meetings was unbelievable, truly unbelievable, he explained. But the aggression soon turned to tears. They said, You dont understand what you are asking of us. [You mean] a parent can just walk in and see how were neglecting these poor kids[?] [] And, of course, at that point we had to say, But what on earth makes you think that were criticizing you? Youre doing an impossible job remarkably well. And, of course, then the tears came as you can imagine. Finally they agreed the experiment should at least be tried.
 
I never heard any more about the issue at all. Nobody ever came back to me and said, The six months are up. Nobody ever reported that it had been a success or a failure; all I knew was that somehow I heard that two wards were doing it, four wards were doing it, the whole hospital was doing it. And since then weve had almost unrestricted visiting in the whole hospital.
 
Similar experiments were conducted in London, although changes on the Continent didnt happen until the late 1970s. In 1959, the British minister of health made it official policy. And in the early 1960s, Robertson told BBC Radio parents that they should sit-in by their childrens cot and force the hospital to try to evict them. Slowly the tide began to turn.

I am very skeptical of hospitals myself.  What bugs me is that people then assume Im some kind of anti-western air-head hippie.  But most people dont understand that there is a distinction between the scientific method and its use (or lack thereof) in the medical establishment.  The reason Im skeptical of hospitals is not that they are scientific, its that they arent scientific enough.
 
Some examples:
* Studies have shown that performing episiotomies during routine child-birth has no positive effects.  But it is still common.
* Ditto for circumcision (fortunately this is getting less common).
 
My poorly-informed opinion is that a large part of the problem is that MDs are not really trained as scientists.

Related: Prologue. Hard as it is to believe, during the early twentieth century, a whole school of mental health professionals decided that unconditional love was a terrible thing to give a child. The government printed pamphlets warning mothers against the dangers of holding their kids. The head of the American Psychological Association and even a mothers organization endorsed the position that mothers were dangerous  until psychologist Harry Harlow set out to prove them wrong, with a series of experiments with monkeys.

Doctors shouldnt be trained as scientists, because practicing medicine isnt science.  Science is about what is true in general of some class of objects.  Medicine is about what is true of this or that particular patient.  Of course, doctors apply the results of science in their work, so they should know a lot of science.  But its still the case that what doctors are doing isnt itself science.

david - I realize that doctors do not perform science, which is exactly why they arent trained as scientists.
 
The reason Id like to see them have more scientific training is so that they will be more skeptical of things that seem like they should work (like isolating children from parents to prevent infections) without using empirical research to find out if what seems good to them actually is good in reality.

Title: of the MBTA
 
It was night, and Central Square was largely empty. A few cars drove down the street, a few guys loitered outside the bars, a few lights were on in windows, but the city was quietly shutting down. I walked down the steps into the subway, paid my fare, and began looking for a place to sit and read.
 
I found a bench, another kid sitting at the opposite side, and took my seat. Spare a dollar? the kid asked. Sorry, I said, spent everything I have to get in here. Man, wish I had five bucks, he said. If I had that Id be out there grabbing a meal. I havent eaten in like two days.
 
I tried to read my book but he wanted to talk. You just come back from school? he asked. No, I said, I was visiting a friend. Oh, I thought you were at school cause of the book. Oh, Ive been carrying this around all day, I said. What is it? he asked. Its a book about books, I said. He laughed. I thought it was a bible or something.
 
You heading to Alewife? I asked. No, he said, laughing. Im staying right here. I blinked twice and began to realize what he meant. He wasnt asking for money because hed been out all night and spent the cash his parents gave him. He was asking for money because he was homeless. And with fits and starts, he told me a little of his story as I waited for the train.
 
He grew up with his family in New Hampshire. They were rich then, at least by comparison, lived in a real mansion. Inspectors started coming around to check out the house, three in one month. Finally a man came to tell them the bad news. You have to move out, he said. The house is infested with termites; itll collapse within months. What are you talking about? his mom responded. This place is fine; inspectors have been looking it all over. The man picked up a large hammer, lifted it above his head and struck a mighty blow  at the wall. The drywall broke away to reveal termites filling the insides, eating away at the wood.
 
They had to leave fast, didnt even have time to pack stuff. The bulldozers came the next day, turned the whole thing into rubble. They also bulldozed his moms car, where she kept all the money. They were homeless and penniless. The Department of Social Services picked up his five-year-old brother, insisted on $100 fee if they wanted to regain custody. If I had that kind of money, he explained, Id be eating with it.
 
So he decided to start hitchhiking, head to Cambridge where he had some family. Caught a ride in the back of a UPS truck, then after that dropped him off, waited for another hour or two in the middle of nowhere before he could find someone else. Finally he found his way to part of the Boston subway system, where he managed to sneak his way through the turnstiles. Now he could ride all around town, get to Cambridge, where he set up base in Central Square.
 
Mostly I just sit here, he explained. Sometimes I just ride the trains all day, Braintree to Alewife and back. Found a violin some guy had lost  hey, Im homeless and youre not  and started playing it for money, but the cops picked me up for performing without a license and threw me in jail for the night. Just because Im a homeless kid youre going to throw me in jail? Anyway, I make more money than that just telling jokes.
 
Pretty absurd, actually. Spent all day here asking folks for spare change, nobody could spare a thing. Here I am, homeless kid in Cambridge, and nobody even has a couple spare pennies!
 
To outward appearances he seems like a normal kid with a bit of an army look. His hair is buzzed, he wears a wifebeater shirt with an army jacket and baggy army pants. At first I thought this was just a style, but actually its utilitarian  everything he owns is in the pockets of those pants. He showed me what he had.
 
Stole this from a friend today, he said, pulling something out from under his jacket. Brand new CD player, awesome headphones, full batteries, great CD inside. He began playing it for me; it was rap songs: Ridin and Eminem. And check out this he said, before pulling out a PSP. Got this when we were rich, but cant use it for much now; had to sell all our games so we could try to find a house. He popped it open. See, no cartridges. Still, I borrow some from friends sometimes.
 
There was a pause, as Eminem came out of his headphones, which hed cranked all the way up so I could listen. Man, imagine if Eminem were right here now, all those girls shaking their asses by him. Wouldnt that be crazy? Crazier things have happened, I said. Lots of famous people go to Harvard Square. Yeah, he said, Beyonce was there the other week  came in for a wedding or something  it was like a mob scene, people jumping all over her.
 
He often took the conversation in the direction of such imaginations  what if a celebrity popped up here? He talked about how he used to play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas with a cheat code to make celebrities appear in the game. But aside from these discursions, he was remarkably cogent, pretty sane for someone in such a screwed-up situation.
 
Man, my life sucks, he said after a pause. If you could do anything, what would you do? I asked. If I could do anything? he said. Yeah. Man, Id be back at home with my mom and brothers and family and stuff.
 
He begun telling me something about his mom  how shed managed to recover one of her debit cards from the rubble of her car and bought a new house, but never told him about it, hed only heard rumor of it third-hand, how shed put her own child out on the street to fend for himself, but I couldnt quite hear him because the train pulled up as he was talking. He finally stopped talking, but I strained, waiting for more. Thats your train, he finally said, you better catch it. Sorry, I said, walking towards it.
 
I grabbed a seat, hearing Spare change? Spare change? as the doors closed and we pulled away. I started trying to read my book, but found I wasnt really capable of reading anything at all.

Despite my best efforts, I can already imagine what a lot of you are going to say: youre being naieve, the kids a liar, doesnt your privileged ass know there are lots of kids like that, whats the big deal. I cant stop you from saying that, but maybe we can also talk seriously about the pain.

Here were my thoughts:
 
Wow, thats incredibly painful.
 
I should help him. I should give him $100. No, I should raise money for him on my website and get much more.
 
But there are lots of people to help. Maybe I should donate money to an organization instead.
 
But do organizations do any good? Why hasnt he visited one already? There have to be organizations to help people like that.
 
Oh right, you always hear stories about how jaded and humanless social workers at such organizations are. I can kind of see why  can you imagine listening to tragedies like that all day and trying to remain human? Let alone the lying and stealing and so on
 
Wow, thats incredibly painful.

Ok, so, I assume from your comments that you already realize that the story the kid told you was almost certainly not true.
 
It is of course painful to talk to people who are in those sorts of situations; it makes your own privilege feel like a mark of shame.
 
But, I think to be honest with yourself, you have to ask yourself the question: How would you feel differently if you actually knew this kids true story?  While hes no doubt had a tough life, the reality is that hes probably also made a lot of incredibly stupid choices.  Thats why hes making up stories to explain his situation and fixating on the easy bling-bling life of the celebrity.
 
You ask about giving money, and about support organizations, and social workers.  Those things are the easy part of the problem, though.  The tough part of the problem is getting this kid to a point where he can make constructive use of those things.  Note that Im not saying his situation is his fault.  I am saying that you cant fix his problems just by giving him things that he doesnt have right now.  He has to change himself also.

Aaron, I dont think you understood what Mark said: that the kid is making up preposterous stories indicates that he finds it difficult to face the reality of the situation, a reality that probably makes him feel ashamed.  Whether youre without moral flaw is besides the point; he could easily be suffering from a mental disorder.  The very improbability of the story itself strikes me as a cry for help. (Initially, the first mention of money left in a car led me to anticipate a con job.)
 
Ive had experience with a close acquaintence who fell into the same kind of situation, and what impressed me at the time (as it does here) was the overwhelming aversion to confronting the problem.  One statement Ill never forget: how sleeping in Golden Gate Park should not be deemed unacceptable and in fact was just like camping.

This is why the answer is not organizations, the government, charity from strangers, etc.
 
The order of assistance should be: self, immediate family, extended family, friends, organizations, town, county, state, federal. Then, however fantastical the story is, the individual would have to convince each successive party.

Response to Aarons out-of-band question about what is so preposterous about the kids story: Inspectors repeatedly come to check out the house. If the house were in danger of imminent collapse, would multiple visits be necessary, given how easy it is to probe a beam?  Inspector says itll collapse within months, but they dont have time to retrieve any of their belongings before its razed the very next day?  How did they manage to bulldoze the moms car, anyway?  How does that work?  Isnt it a little convenient to the story thats where their savings are kept?  What prompted local authorities to take the brother that would require only $100 to get him back? Arent these matters a bit more complicated than getting your stuff out of storage?  What happened to that family of his he said lived in Cambridge?  His mom used a debit card to buy a house?  If they have a bank account with enough money to buy a house outright, why was so much cash kept in the car?  If your car had just been clobbered by a bulldozer, would you search through the rubble trying to retrieve the debit card, or just get the bank to replace it?  And she never told the kid about the new house?  Again, what rings familiar to my ear is the sense that this ever-more-elaborate set of things is happening to him all at once and he has no control over them.

Considering I only spoke to him for a short time, he was quite young, and hes had serious traumatic experiences, I dont think the fact that some portions of his story seem odd is unreasonable. It certainly doesnt make the story preposterous.

I doubt his story is true. Ive known homeless kids who tell stories that make themselves look worse than the truth, maybe for the reason Mike mentioned: they dont want to face the truth. Regardless of his story, hes almost certainly homeless and he obviously needs help. The only important question is how best to help him.
 
I think focusing on his pain, youre likely to do whatever you can to reduce it as quickly as possible. But I dont think giving him a dollar or a hundred is really very helpful. Not only is it a short-term solution to a long-term problem, but it puts him in the role of helpless charity recipient. At the very least, pay him a fair wage to use one of the skills he mentioned (music, comedy, GTA) so he develops and maintains a sense of self-worth that isnt dependent on you. Because his real pain is not so much being homeless as feeling worthless.

For the rest of this comment thread, Im stipulating that hes telling the truth. If people cant handle that, Ill close the thread.
 
Scotts suggestion is a common one, but its always struck me as bizarre. Forcing people into wage slavery doesnt seem like much of an improvement.

Cmon Aaron, I never said he did anything wrong, and Im not saying the world is perfect.  I said he probably made stupid choices.  Weve all made stupid choices, there is nothing wrong with making a stupid choice.  And I am not denying that this kid has experienced many awful things that you or I havent - serial foster care, parental abuse, whatever.
 
But if you believe that his story is even basically true, and only superficially false, then you truly are naive.  Not one element of his story is even remotely believable if you treat it with just a moderate degree of skepticism.
 
I was like you once:  The turning point came when this guy came up to me in boston one day and said that his car was broken down on storrow drive, and he needed some money to get it towed, and he didnt have his wallet, and so on and so forth.  The only thing about this story that was totally unbelievable was that this same guy had come to me with the exact same story several months earlier.    That made me pretty skeptical of street stories in general from that day forward.
 
But the real lesson was this:  This guy was well-dressed, good-looking, and was very eloquent.   I liked him a lot and really wanted to believe his story the first time.  Now that he was exposed, I could not for the life of me understand why he was wasting his time with this sort of nickel-and-dime con job!  The only explanation Ive come up with that makes any sense is that he just simply didnt want a job, or the responsibility that went with it.  And thats a perfectly reasonable choice to make, but dont go around trying to trick me into giving you money because you dont feel like working.
 
Anyway, how are you going to help the poor if you have this naive view of poor people as morally spotless individuals who are never even partially responsible for their own situation?  You want to give credence to this kids story because it makes you feel like someone shared something important with you, and because it fits your preconceptions about the world - but the damn thing was made out of whole cloth!  If you cant understand the fact that this kid feels the need to make shit up to divert responsibility from himself, than you cant actually understand his situation.

Sure, it makes sense that someone who needs money will make up a story about why he needs it. But how does that apply to this situation? It was very clear that I didnt have any money, his story consisted of telling me that he was better off than he seemed (not surprisingly considering thats what you have to do to remain sane in such a situation), he was completely honest about how he stole things whenever he got the chance, and I had to pull the story out of him with a needle.
 
But apparently none of this matters; ideology insists that the problem is that the kid just doesnt want a job. Well, I dont see why theres anything wrong with that, but it doesnt even apply in this case since his expressed goal is to be able to go back to high school!
 
You people are pathological. Like the social workers who become callous to escape pain, you assume everybody in dire straits is a shiftless liar so that you can avoid admiting that the worlds messed up. And you go to such lengths to maintain this, that your stories end up making less sense than his.
 
This thread is closed.

Obviously I dont see it as wage slavery. I see it as offering him an active vs. a passive role in his own life. Id suggest you talk to a few more homeless people about how they feel about earning their income vs. recieving charity. I expect most will tell you they prefer to earn their income. I certainly would. Which would you prefer?

Well now that Ive commented in the declaratively closed thread (before reading the declaration), I might as well continue
 
Anyone can see the worlds messed up and feel bad about it. But if thats all youre doing, youre not helping anyone. Social workers spend their lives helping people like this kid, and I find your criticism of them offensively absurd.
 
I dont know anyone else in this thread, so they might all be the heartless bastards youve painted them. Or they might be good people who have different ideas about how to help and are acting on those ideas to improve this messed up world. I like to think Im in the latter group, but Ill leave it to the people who actually need help to judge whether or not I helped them.

Sorry, but there really is more to be said. Its obvious to me that the kids story is mostly made up, but there may well be elements of truth to it.  In particular, I suspect hes terribly angry at his mother.  None of us are really in a position to know all this  whether what he needs most right now is intervention, to get a job, admit he made bad choices, whatever  but heres a suggestion. Youre compassionate. You know where he lives, sort of. He knows you, and feels comfortable opening up. Go back and talk to him. Let him know that you care what happens to him.

Having a good friend that works as an investigator for the DCF (Department of Child and Family Services) in CT, I would say (1) the person you met may very well be telling the truth, or most of the truthand (2) these situations are not uncommon.
 
Ive spend several nights hanging out with the DCF friend and two of his colleagues (3 people with 30+ years experience between them).  After those nights, I spend two or three days waiting for poorer areas to blow up w/ pure frustration.
 
 what you can do is get more first hand experience, through community organizations (volunteer a few hours on a saturday, etctheres food banks, etc in Cambridge)and then let your own curiousity, experiences, lead you to a path of useful action  which in your case may be uniquely useful.  Or you can just forget about it  which doesnt seem likely:)

I dont know what to tell you, Aaron. Is there anything you can do to improve that guys life? Anything at all?
 
About any part of the story that is true is a lesson in the government screwing people over, from the bulldozers to taking away the violin (and by the way, if that part is true, are we to believe he also plays the violin?).
 
Marks comment about the man with the story of the broken car reminds me:
 
I dont think Ive ever seen a street beggar in Portland, so I was pretty unused to them when I was in Cambridge for Wikimania last month. I ignored the ones that sat on the sidewalks and rattled paper cups full of change. So I didnt hear any stories from any of them. I dont think it was really in my power to help them, and  Aaron is going to hate me for this, no doubt  it wasnt really my responsibility. However, I did give away money to someone exactly once. I was sitting on a park-bench one night, writing something in my notepad, when this man casually walks up and says, Good evening sir, can you spare a dollar?. Now, although I had been ignoring impoverished beggars all week long, somehow I found myself giving this man a dollar. I didnt even think about it! By the time I realized, I just gave that man a dollar!, he was gone, so I couldnt ask him how hed tricked me into doing it. I think it was that he was friendly, well-dressed, walked up to me, and addressed me the way an ordinary guy from my own social class would. So I feel a bit guilty about that.
 
This is only tangentially related: As a small-town boy, I was pretty surprised how safe I felt in Boston at night. My own back porch is creepy at night because its so empty  not a soul is stirring and all the doors are locked. This may have been foolish, but I walked all over the town in the middle of the night with my laptop in my backpack. Before I went, I had expected the street to feel threatening, but it didnt.
 
You dont mind if I go on and on about my week in a big city, do you? Ive never seen so many police officers, either. In the Portland area, the only cops you see are lurking at intersections trying to catch speeders. Over there there were pedestrian cops patrolling the sidewalks. I actually felt like they were on my side for once. Dont get me wrong; I dont believe in concentrations of power. But I got the impression somehow that the cops in Boston were doing a worthy job.
 
Anyhow. I dont see why you insist, for the sake of the discussion even, on supposing that his story is true. Its not that I think it matters if its true  you should still try to help him if you feel thats right. But exactly how you can best help him probably depends on whether the story is true or not, and its not.
 
One last thing: You had an essay about new software that hasnt reappeared yet. Is it going to or have you dropped it? I am really interested in your thoughts on this. Thanks.
 
Wait if the thread is closed, does that mean Aaron is going to see this?

I talk about my actions towards homeless and beggars at the URL above.  That his story is totally factual is almost completely not true.  But there is surely some facts involved in his story.  Would money have helped? probably not.. but what would have?  Only knowing him more would have given you the ability to know perhaps some of an answer to that question.  Why not go hang out with him?  make him a friend.  It sometimes works.

My condolences. In any case, I think you raised some  hard truths that the Wikipedia community needs to hear. Oh, and Im still waiting for one bloody developer to look at my patch to implement RSS feeds for watchlists.
 
In the end, Wikipedia will suffer from the same problem it has always had: stubbornness. There are other projects more deserving of your time.
 
Im curious to see where you plan to take this next, namely to other projects. How can other community-driven sites foster the same sense of responsibility on the part of its users that Wikipedia has? And how can the code of such sites encourage casual contributors to make useful contributions and discourage vandalism and non-useful contributions?
 
What youve described in some of your articles seems to be essentially a Long Tailification of the community process: a million people gently tap a cats tail over here, and the loudest meow youve ever heard comes out over there. The issue, as I see it, is the parallelization problem, how can you break up a large complex project into one that casual users can contribute to in small chunks, when these users lack domain knowledge and have no motivation to learn any particular procedures specific to your project?

Title: (The Dandy Warhols) Come Down
 
Well, the Wikipedia election has finally ended. The good news is that I can now talk about other things again. (For example, did you know that Erik Mller eats babies?) I have a backlog of about 20 posts that I built up over the course of the election. But instead of springing them on you all at once, Ill try to do daily posting again starting Monday. (Oooh.)
 
The actual results havent been announced yet (and probably wont be for another couple days, while they check the list of voters for people who voted twice) but my impression is that I probably lost. Many wags have commented on how my campaign was almost destined to lose: I argued that the hard-core Wikipedia contributors werent very important, but those were precisely the people who could vote for me  in other words, I alienated my only constituency.
 
Aaron Swartz: Why is he getting so much attention? wrote fellow candidate Kelly Martin. The community has long known that edit count is a poor measure of contributions. Others, meanwhile, insisted my claims were so obviously wrong as to not be even worth discussing.
 
Jimbo Wales, on the other hand, finally sent me a nice message the other day letting me know that hed removed the offending section from his talk and looked forward to sitting down with me and investigating the topic more carefully.
 
And for my part, I hope to be able to take up some of the offers Ive received for computer time and run my algorithm across all of Wikipedia and publish the results in more detailed form. (Id also like to use the results to put up a little website where you can type in the name of a page and see who wrote what, color-coded or something like that.)
 
As for the election itself, its much harder to draw firm conclusions. Its difficult in any election, this one even more so because we have so little data  no exit polls or phone surveys or even TV pundits to rely upon. Still, Im fairly content seeing the kind words of all the incredible people I respect. Their support means a great deal to me.
 
The same is true of the old friends who wrote in during my essays along with all the new people who encouraged me to keep on writing. Writing the essays on a regular schedule was hard work  at one point, after sleeping overnight at my mothers bedside in the hospital, I trundled down at seven in the morning to find an Internet connection so I could write and post one  but your support made it worth the effort.
 
I hope that whoever wins takes what Ive written into consideration. Im not sure who that is yet, but there are some hints. I was reading an irreverent site critical of Wikipedia when I came across its claim that Jimbo Wales had sent an email to the Wikipedia community telling them who they should vote for. I assumed the site had simply made it up to attack Jimbo, but when I searched I found it really was genuine:
 
I personally strongly strongly support the candidacies of Oscar and 
  Mindspillage.
 
[]
 
There are other candidates, some good, but at least some of them are 
  entirely unacceptable because they have proven themselves repeatedly 
  unable to work well with the community.
 
For those reading the tea leaves, this suggests that the results will be something like: Eloquence, Oscar, Mindspillage. But well see.
 
The let-down after the election is probably not the best time to make plans but, if I had to, Id probably decide to stay out of Wikipedia business for a while. Its a great and important project, but not the one for me.
 
Anyway, now everyone can go back to vandalizing my Wikipedia page. Laters.

Wikipedia is big; it contains multitudes.  There are people who spend all their time on the mailing lists, and people who mostly edit talk pages, and people who copyedit, and people who debate mathematics and write about train stations.  I havent gotten the impression the communitys against you  one of the tenets of the internet is that the loudest voices get heard vastly disproportionately.  I mean, its the /internet/.  Ive gotten strange, insulting comments on a blog entry I posted about shoppening malls, and Im not particularly visible or controversial.
 
(Also, I dont see anything wrong with Jimbo endorsing candidates  again, wikipedia is huge, and its difficult to get a feel for all the personalities at play.  Wales probably knows more about Wikipedias human aspect  its flesh-and-blood organizational and beaurocratic mechanics  than anyone, so his suggestions are helpful.)

I dont disagree with your conclusion; in fact, Ive been saying the same thing all long.  Although I do not have stats to prove it, I suspect that the majority of article editing is done by people who are unaware that the community exists, and certainly by people who take relatively little interest in governance issues, at least not until they run into someone they feel needs to be more governed than they are.
 
And I do admit that I misunderstood the nature of your analysis; I now realize that youve just replicated the IBM history flow research, which, sadly, does not add new information to the analysis, either.

Title: Code, and Other Laws of Wikipedia

Part 1: Wikimedia at the Crossroads
Part 2: Who Writes Wikipedia?
Part 3: Who Runs Wikipedia?

Code is law, Lawrence Lessig famously said years ago, and time has not robbed the idea of any of its force. The point, so eloquently defended in his book Code, and Other Laws of Cyberspace, is that in the worlds created by software, the design of the software regulates behavior just as strongly as any formal law does; more effectively, in fact.
 
The point is obvious in some contexts. In the online 3D universe of Second Life, if the software prevents you from typing a certain word, thats a far more effective restraint on speech in that world than any US law could ever be in ours. But the point is far more subtle than that; it applies with equal force to the world of Wikipedia, the thriving community and culture that our wiki software creates.
 
For one thing, the software decides who gets to be part of the community. If using it is clear and simple, then lots of people can use it. But, if its complicated, then only those who take the time to learn it are able to take part. And, as weve seen, lots of intelligent people dont even understand how to edit Wikipedia, let alone do any of the other things on the site.
 
For another, the software decides how the community operates. Features like administrative controls privilege some users over others. Support for things like stable revisions decide what sorts of things get published. The structure of talk pages help decide what and how things get discussed.
 
The page design the site uses encourages specific actions by making some links clear and prominent. Software functions like categories make certain kinds of features possible. The formatting codes used for things like infoboxes and links determine how easy it is for newcomers to edit those pieces of the site.
 
All of these things are political choices, not technical ones. Its not like theres a right answer thats obvious to any intelligent programmer. And these choices can have huge effects on the community. Thats why its essential the community be involved in making these decisions.
 
The current team of Wikipedia programmers is a volunteer group (although a couple of them were recently hired by the Wikimedia Foundation so they could live a little more comfortably) working much like a standard free software community, discussing things on mailing lists and IRC channels. They got together in person in the days before Wikimania to discuss some of the current hot topics in the software.
 
One presentation was by a usability expert who told us about a study done on how hard people found it to add a photo to a Wikipedia page. The discussion after the presentation turned into a debate over whether Wikipedia should be easy to to use. Some suggested that confused users should just add their contributions in the wrong way and a more experienced users would come along to clean their contributions up. Others questioned whether confused users should be allowed to edit the site at all  were their contributions even valuable?
 
As a programmer, I have a great deal of respect for the members of my trade. But with all due respect, are these really decisions that the programmers should be making?
 
Meanwhile, Jimbo Wales also has a for-profit company, Wikia, which recently received $4 million in venture capital funding. Wales has said, including in his keynote speech at Wikimania, that one of the things he hopes to spend it on is hiring programmers to improve the Wikipedia software.
 
This is the kind of thing that seems like a thoughtful gesture if you think of the software as neutral  after all, improvements are improvements  but becomes rather more problematic if technical choices have political effects. Should executives and venture capitalists be calling the shots on some of these issues?
 
The Wikipedia community is enormously vibrant and I have no doubt that the site will manage to survive many software changes. But if were concerned about more than mere survival, about how to make Wikipedia the best that it can be, we need to start thinking about software design as much as we think about the rest of our policy choices.

The discussion after the presentation turned into a debate over whether Wikipedia should be easy to to use.  So, wiki, wiki is now Hawaiian for quick and difficult?  Yikes - talking about removing the priori from a priori. Huh.  Maybe they could rename it SoftwareAsUsualPedia - wherein we follow the strong industry tradition of doing all we can to alienate the user.  Sorry to be so snarky, but I just see red after 30 years in the software industry, and it always comes down to the conclusion that the product is the next best thing to creation itself, if only it werent for the verdammt users!

Of course, your general point about the social/political ramification of software decisions is correct (that perspective is one of the reasons I voted for you), but you havent really said anything specifically relevant to the Wikimedia projects.  What software changes do you see as potential solutions to Wikipedia social problems?
 
Im not sure how, specifically, the input/influence of venture capitalists on MediaWiki development poses a threat.  Certainly its something to watch for, but I dont think its problematic in and of itself.  It seems like, from a software perspective, whats good for Wikia is good for Wikipedia, et. al.  Issues of control vs. accessibility will vary from project to project within Wikia.  For some wikis I would expect a desire for more openness and anonymity than Wikipedia; for others, more editorial control.  It seems like it will be in the interest of Wikia to make the software more flexible, and Wikimedia projects would be able to pick and choose which software changes to utilize.

Maybe its just me, but it seems like everywhere you look people are trying to get a piece of Wikipedia. Wikis sites have been started in every field from the Muppets to the law. The domain Wiki.com recently was sold for 3 million dollars. Professor Cass Sunstein, previously seen arguing the Internet could tear apart the republic, just published a new book arguing tools like wikis will lead us to Infotopia. So is it possible to replicate Wikipedias success? Whats the key that made it work?
 
Unfortunately, this question hasnt gotten the attention it deserves. For the most part, people have simply assumed that Wikipedia is as simple as the name suggests: install some wiki software, say that its for writing an encyclopedia, and voila!  problem solved. But as pretty much everyone who has tried has discovered, it isnt as simple as that.
 
Technology industry people tend to reduce web sites down to their technology: Wikipedia is simply an instance of wiki software, DailyKos just blog software, and Reddit just voting software. But these sites arent just installations of software, there also communities of people.
 
Building a community is pretty tough; it requires just the right combination of technology and rules and people. And while its been clear that communities are at the core of many of the most interesting things on the Internet, were still at the very early stages of understanding what it is that makes them work.
 
But Wikipedia isnt even a typical community. Usually Internet communities are groups of people who come together to discuss something, like cryptography or the writing of a technical specification. Perhaps they meet in an IRC channel, a web forum, a newsgroup, or on a mailing list, but the focus is always something out there, something outside the discussion itself.
 
But with Wikipedia, the goal is building Wikipedia. Its not a community set up to make some other thing, its a community set up to make itself. And since Wikipedia was one of the first sites to do it, we know hardly anything about building communities like that.
 
Indeed, we know hardly anything about building software for that. Wiki software has been around for years  the first wiki was launched in 1995; Wikipedia wasnt started until 2001  but it was always used like any other community, for discussing something else. It wasnt generally used for building wikis in themselves; indeed, it wasnt very good at doing that.
 
Wikipedias real innovation was much more than simply starting a community to build an encyclopedia or using wiki software to do it. Wikipedias real innovation was the idea of radical collaboration. Instead of having a small group of people work together, it invited the entire world to take part. Instead of assigning tasks, it let anyone work on whatever they wanted, whenever they felt like it. Instead of having someone be in charge, it let people sort things out for themselves. And yet it did all this towards creating a very specific product.
 
Even now, its hard to think of anything else quite like it. Books have been co-authored, but usually only by two people. Large groups have written encyclopedias, but usually only by being assigned tasks. Software has been written by communities, but typically someone is in charge.
 
But if we take this definition, rather than wiki software, as the core of Wikipedia, then we see that other types of software are also forms of radical collaboration. Reddit, for example, is radical collaboration to build a news site: anyone can add or edit, nobody is in charge, and yet an interesting news site results. Freed from the notion that Wikipedia is simply about wiki software, one can even imagine new kinds of sites. What about a debate wiki, where people argue about a question, but the outcome is a carefully-constructed discussion for others to read later, rather than a morass of bickering messages.
 
If we take radical collaboration as our core, then it becomes clear that extending Wikipedias success doesnt simply mean installing more copies of wiki software for different tasks. It means figuring out the key principles that make radical collaboration work. What kinds of projects is it good for? How do you get them started? How do you keep them growing? What rules do you put in place? What software do you use?
 
These questions cant be answered from the armchair, of course. They require experimentation and study. And that, in turn, requires building a community around strong collaboration itself. It doesnt help us much if each person goes off and tries to start a wiki on their own. To learn what works and what doesnt, we need to share our experiences and be willing to test new things  new goals, new social structures, new software.

Sigh  I know the above is going to go over well, but I keep saying this, its a very old idea. Its the revolutionary commune. Im 100% serious. That was the whole dream of radical collaboration. The phrase anyone work on whatever they wanted is almost exactly what the communes would tout. Wikipedia is blessed with a sugar daddy, so it can paper over the problems of money, which would sink real communes as soon as the initial enthusiasm ran low.
 
And the commune sometimes had an owner who did very well eventually selling the supposed communal property.
 
Wikipidias real innovation is that it found a way to work the revolutionary ideology trick in these jaded times.

Wikipedia is so valuable as a property and so easy to replicate that the odds of it disappearing approach nil, and the odds approach nil faster with every passing day. So, even if Seths right and every contributer is drinking the Kool-Aid and the experiment will end tonight, Wikipedia is still quite a testament to the human mind and will persist for a very, very long time.
 
Conversely, imagine trying to build a hospital Wiki style. Perhaps it would be useful to take a walk through a robust classification system of human endeavor (not knowledge, endeavor), say Yahoo, or Deweys decimal system, or the Library of Congresss classification scheme, and make a big list of sites that address various areas of endeavor. Youd probably need Google for this. This would probably require a large wall covered with paper and relatively small type, like 10pt. Look for areas of endeavor that are ill-statisfied by the existing sites. There are then many different things that can be done. 1) think about where the world and the internet diverge. How many sites are actually producing more money for charities? Could engineers and architects collaborate to create hospital, public works, and housing designs free for poor nations to use? This might take forty weeks at forty to sixty  hours a week, but its doable. Just barely, but its doable. 2) Find ways to tell people about the variance between what is and what is needed. 3) Find out why the rich and the powerful (the current users of the internet) arent doing more.

Vote for me in the election for the Wikimedia Foundations Board of Directors.
 
Wikipedia, the Vice President of the World Book told us, is now recognized by ten percent of Americans. He presented this in a tone of congratulation: with no marketing budget or formal organization, a free online-only encyclopedia written by volunteers had achieved a vast amount of attention. But I took it a different way. Only ten percent? I thought. That means we have ninety percent to go!
 
Wikipedia is one of the few things that pretty much everyone finds useful. So how do we get all of them to use it? The first task, it appears, is telling them it exists. An ad campaign or PR blitz doesnt quite seem appropriate for the job, though. Instead, our promotion should work the same way way the rest of Wikipedia works: let the community do it.
 
Wikipedias users come from all over society: different cultures, different countries, different places, different fields of study. The physics grad students who contribute heavily to physics articles are in a much better position to promote it to physicists than a promotional flack from the head office. The Pokemon fan maintaining the Pokemon articles probably knows how to reach other Pokemaniacs than any marketing expert.
 
Sure, you might say, but isnt the whole question of marketing Wikipedia somewhat silly? After all, you obviously know about Wikipedia, and your friends probably all seem to as well. But things are a lot thinner than you might expect: as noted above, only one in ten Americans even knows what Wikipedia is, and most of those dont truly understand it.
 
Its shocking to discover how even smart, technically-minded people cant figure out how to actually edit Wikipedia. Dave Winer wrote some of the first software to have an Edit This Page button (indeed, he operated editthispage.com for many years) and yet he at first complained that he couldnt figure out how to edit a page on Wikipedia. Michael Arrington reviews advanced Web 2.0 websites daily, yet he noted that Many people dont realize how easy it is for anyone to add content to wikipedia (Ive done it several times). If prominent technologists have trouble, imagine the rest of the world.
 
Obviously, this has implications for the software side: we need to work hard on making Wikipedias interface clearer and more usable. But theres also a task here for the community: giving talks and tutorials to groups that you know about, explaining the core ideas behind Wikipedia, and giving demonstrations of how to get involved in it. The best interface in the world is no substitute for real instruction and even the clearest document explaining our principles will be ignored in a way that a personal presentation wont.
 
But beyond simply giving people the ability to contribute, we need to work to make contributing more rewarding. As I previously noted, many people decide to dive into writing for Wikipedia, only to watch their contributions be summarily reverted. Many people create a new article, only to see it get deleted after an AfD discussion where random Wikipedians try to think up negative things to say about it. For someone who thought they were donating their time to help the project, neither response is particularly encouraging.
 
Im not saying that we should change our policies or automatically keep everything a newcomer decides to add so we dont hurt their feelings. But we do need to think more about how to enforce policies without turning valuable newcomers away, how we can educate them instead of alienating them.
 
At Wikimania, no less an authority than Richard Stallman (who himself long ago suggested the idea of a free online encyclopedia) wandered around the conference complaining about a problem hed discovered with a particular Wikipedia article. He could try to fix it himself, he noted, but it would take an enormous amount of his time and the word would probably just get reverted. Hes not the only one  I constantly hear tales from experts about problems they encounter on Wikipedia, but are too complicated for them to fix alone. What if we could collect these complaints on the site, instead of having these people make them at parties?
 
One way to do that would be to have some sort of complaint-tracking system for articles, like the discussion system of talk pages. Instead of simply complaining about an article in public, Stallman could follow a link from it to file a complaint. The complaint would be tracked and stored with the article. More dedicated Wikipedians would go through the list of complaints, trying to address them and letting the submitter know when they were done. Things like POV allegations could be handled in a similar way: a notice saying neutrality was disputed could appear on the top of the page until the complaint was properly closed.
 
This is just one idea, of course, but its an example of the kinds of things we need to think about. Wikipedia is visited by millions each day; how do get them to contribute back their thoughts on the article instead of muttering them under their breath or airing them to their friends?

While your intentions are good, I dont see where youve addressed the core problem.
 
Problem: Its not worth an experts time to argue with bureaucrats.
 
Instead of simply complaining about an article in public, Stallman could follow a link from it to file a complaint. The complaint would be tracked and stored with the article. More dedicated Wikipedians would go through 
 
In other words, the expert gets to deal with MORE BUREAUCRATS.
 
How does this help? Are the upper-level admins (so much for anarchy) going to be easier to deal with? Maybe. It still seems to me that the basic issue, of having to waste a lot of time pleading a case to non-experts, remains unresolved. Perhaps it can be made to work with sufficient resources (which brings us back to the money I keep mentioning ).
 
I have my own dissatifications with certain articles. And again, its just not worth it for me to have a big argument over it. Ive done edit-wars a few times, and it wasnt fun.

Actually, after thinking about it a little, maybe this does help, and Ive answered my own question.
 
Restated: Lets create a class of assistant editors in charge of expert contributions. The function of the assistant editor is to shield the expert from having to deal with the frustration of battling the freelancers who will trash the experts work out of ignorance, or even for thrills in lording it over the expert. The assistant editor will indicate that the experts contribution is under the protection of the Wikipedia capos, and thus should not be challenged lightly, and definitely not for status-games.
 
You could probably get people to do this mostly for free, for the emotional satisifaction of helping real experts against the hordes. Its kind of a good-cop/bad-cop result, but that does work.
 
Its still dealing with bureaucrats, so it has that barrier. But it could be an improvement.

Seth: I dont think Aaron was saying the complaints should only be viewable by admins.
 
In fact, I think in practice they could be shunted off to the discussion page  the complaint mechanism would just be an alternate interface to article:talk, one thats not hidden outside the main content frame and doesnt seem to be asking whether you have time to get involved in a debate.  (Honestly, the discussion tab is a really interface element  it doesnt even make clear that its discussion about the article, not about the topic.)

I remember kind of suggested that discussion system of talk pages for Infogami while ago - directly to AaronSWWell, thats okay its just a system which not only leaves the end product (entries, articles) but how messy (or beautiful and even touching) co-editing process, and discussion process can be. (Only if we had all the videos of how all the gorgeous artworks are made, tried - how painters and sculptors wondered and tried and so on. Then we have better things to do than just walking around dead end products hanging in the museumResult only is a kind of Platonist perversion West :-P - and many human civilizations and cultures are now stuck with.)
 
How much suggested - such complaint system would work can be tested with test cases, probably. Wikipedia, considering from its standing and spirit, should be able to accommodate such monitored, tracked, and analyzed experiments - maybe all the time, over other kind of ideas and visions even.
 
But they might say they tried such ideas, or they had experience in Nupedia - enough and - I dont know they just verbally say it - or they can show some analysis, written stuff with evidences or not.
 
Even they say they tried and didnt work, it can be retried and reworked. On several different kind of entries, AaronSW (and his associates, friends), or anyone, can try working on.
 
I remember doing a team project on conflict in Sierra Leone, and I remember more about how each of team member came up with new ideas and inspirations - day to day, over weeks than the result. That experience gave me something really unforgettable, always telling me, recalling me something about human potentials, Dont ignore, Dont underestimate - any of us got talents - can work as mediator, moderator, cheer leader, surprise giver, etc.
 
How the end product wasI dont remember about it much. I only remember the video clips of long discussions the team had - stored in my head.
 
We are all alive and kicking and so on, and we need to do something about that too. And if Wikipedia fails to document such process, or dont care about those processes, then its not for humans who are interested in other humans.

You know, I was much enamored with the Wiki concept at one time, even coding my own PHP version of a wiki where I tried to blend aspects of web log into wiki concept. That was in 2001-2002.
 
Anymore, Im not so sure Wiki is the greatest thing, especially on a scale of Wikipedia.
 
Ive experienced frustration on editing articles and it seems that there is a clique of WikiNazis that really get off on imposing their narrow view of matters and worse, go against the Wikpedia stated NPOV mantra.
 
I offer a recent example - Ive been editing this page recently - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ray_Griffin.
The first line of this persons biography I keep changing from conspiracy theorist to member of 9/11 Truth Movement (with link to that Wikipedia page). An editor keeps changing it back and saying that since Washington Post called him a conspiracy theorist that makes it cited and sourced. To which I argue that conspiracy theory is a genetic fallacy argument, and that while you write many consider other such qualifiers, conspiracy theorist is an editorial call, is negative material and does not adhere to NPOV.
 
In reading through the editors personal pages, it seems that there is a clique of editors that give eachother badges and pride themselves on deleting pages and other acts that I consider over-editing. And as Wikipedia has increased in popularity I am aware that there are teams that are paid to monitor the contents and this coupled with overeditorial zealousness is going to frustrate many a potential writer, leaving the ideologically bent to control content and tone.
 
Ive experienced this on other pages, where they are deleted (or significant content deleted) or where again, overzealousness seems to rule over common sense.

Personally, I think that the real problem here is that, while assuming good faith is already a policy at Wikipedia, it doesnt seem to be practiced anywhere near as often as it should.  Ive seen new users fix something that they believe to be incorrect, and as their thanks they get a Blatantvandal template put on their talk page.  Or they choose their own name as a user name, or the name of something that that makes sense to them, and are blocked without warning with a block description along the lines of user.  This has to have a significant affect in preventing new users from joining up.
 
Regarding the people not being able to figure out how to edit point, another thought might be how to get people to realise that the edit this page really refers to them.  Maybe the name of the button needs to be changed to Edit this page.  Yes, this means you.  Were serious about that.  (-:

As a newish Wikipedian, Ive been literally shocked by some of the deletions stumbled across on subjects I know well. IMO there is definitely some kind of problem if good (subjective statement, I know) content is being wiped wholesale. Apart from that I agree that it isnt particularly easy to actually edit, until you can memorize the markup - but otoh that doesnt really matter because your work, however good or mediocre, will probably get removed anyway :o(

Vote for me in the election for the Wikimedia Foundations Board of Directors.
 
During Wikimania, I gave a short talk proposing some new features for Wikipedia. The audience, which consisted mostly of programmers and other high-level Wikipedians, immediately begun suggesting problems with the idea. Wont bad thing X happen? How will you prevent Y? Do you really think people are going to do Z? For a while I tried to answer them, explaining technical ways to fix the problem, but after a couple rounds I finally said:
 
Stop.
 
If I had come here five years ago and told you I was going to make an entire encyclopedia by putting up a bunch of web pages that anyone could edit, you would have been able to raise a thousand objections: It will get filled with vandalism! The content will be unreliable! No one will do that work for free!
 
And you would have been right to. These were completely reasonable expectations at the time. But heres the funny thing: it worked anyway.
 
At the time, I was just happy this quieted them down. But later I started thinking more about it. Why did Wikipedia work anyway?
 
It wasnt because its programmers were so far-sighted that the software solved all the problems. And it wasnt because the people running it put clear rules in place to prevent misbehavior. We know this because when Wikipedia started it didnt have any programmers (it used off-the-shelf wiki software) and it didnt have clear rules (one of the first major rules was apparently Ignore all rules).
 
No, the reason Wikipedia works is because of the community, a group of people that took the project as their own and threw themselves into making it succeed.
 
People are constantly trying to vandalize Wikipedia, replacing articles with random text. It doesnt work; their edits are undone within minutes, even seconds. But why? Its not magic  its a bunch of incredibly dedicated people who sit at their computers watching every change that gets made. These days they call themselves the recent changes patrol and have special software that makes it easy to undo bad changes and block malicious users with a couple clicks.
 
Why does anyone do such a thing? Its not particularly fascinating work, theyre not being paid to do it, and nobody in charge asked them to volunteer. They do it because they care about the site enough to feel responsible. They get upset when someone tries to mess it up.
 
Its hard to imagine anyone feeling this way about Britannica. There are people who love that encyclopedia, but have any of them shown up at their offices offering to help out? Its hard even to imagine. Average people just dont feel responsible for Britannica; there are professionals to do that.
 
Everybody knows Wikipedia as the site anyone can edit. The article about tree frogs wasnt written because someone in charge decided they needed one and assigned it to someone; it was written because someone, somewhere just went ahead and started writing it. And a chorus of others decided to help out.
 
But whats less well-known is that its also the site that anyone can run. The vandals arent stopped because someone is in charge of stopping them; it was simply something people started doing. And its not just vandalism: a welcoming committee says hi to every new user, a cleanup taskforce goes around doing factchecking. The sites rules are made by rough consensus. Even the servers are largely run this way  a group of volunteer sysadmins hang out on IRC, keeping an eye on things. Until quite recently, the Foundation that supposedly runs Wikipedia had no actual employees.
 
This is so unusual, we dont even have a word for it. Its tempting to say democracy, but thats woefully inadequate. Wikipedia doesnt hold a vote and elect someone to be in charge of vandal-fighting. Indeed, Wikipedia doesnt do anything at all. Someone simply sees that there are vandals to be fought and steps up to do the job.
 
This is so radically different that its tempting to see it as a mistake: Sure, perhaps things have worked so far on this model, but when the real problems hit, things are going to have to change: certain people must have clear authority, important tasks must be carefully assigned, everyone else must understand that they are simply volunteers.
 
But Wikipedias openness isnt a mistake; its the source of its success. A dedicated community solves problems that official leaders wouldnt even know were there. Meanwhile, their volunteerism largely eliminates infighting about who gets to be what. Instead, tasks get done by the people who genuinely want to do them, who just happen to be the people who care enough to do them right.
 
Wikipedias biggest problems have come when its strayed from this path, when its given some people official titles and specified tasks. Whenever that happens, real work slows down and squabbling speeds up. But its an easy mistake to make, so it gets made again and again.
 
Of course, thats not the only reason this mistake is made, its just the most polite. The more frightening problem is that people love to get power and hate to give it up. Especially with a project as big and important as Wikipedia, with the constant swarm of praise and attention, it takes tremendous strength to turn down the opportunity to be its official X, to say instead its a community project, Im just another community member.
 
Indeed, the opposite is far more common. People who have poured vast amounts of time into the project begin to feel they should be getting something in return. They insist that, with all their work, they deserve an official job or a special title. After all, wont clearly assigning tasks be better for everyone?
 
And so, the trend is clear: more power, more people, more problems. Its not just a series of mistakes, its the tendency of the system.
 
It would be absurd for me to say that Im immune to such pressures. After all, Im currently running for a seat on the Wikimedia Board. But I also lie awake at night worrying that I might abuse my power.
 
A systemic tendency like this is not going to be solved by electing the right person to the right place and then going to back to sleep while they solve the problem. If the community wants to remain in charge, its going to have to fight for it. Im writing these essays to help people understand that this is something worth fighting for. And if Im elected to the Board, I plan to keep on writing.
 
Just as Wikipedias success as an encyclopedia requires a world of volunteers to write it, Wikipedias success as an organization requires the community of volunteers to run it. On the one hand, this means opening up the Boards inner workings for the community to see and get involved in. But it also means opening up the actions of the community so the wider world can get involved. Whoever wins this next election, I hope we all take on this task.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

Many of Wikipedias medically related articles (proteins, diseases, genes, etc) rely heavily on the National Library of Medicines Online Mendelian Inheritence in Man (OMIM) database, which is essentially an expert version of Wikipedia. The threshold for editorial access to OMIM is much higher and much vaguer than Wikipedias.

The edits coming into Wikipedia are rather like a grain elevator pouring wheat into a huge pile. The admins have perched themselves at the tip of the growing pile, and they monitor, robotically or otherwise, every edit, especially every new article. Heres the discussion Im currently trying to have with one of Wikipedias admins about a set of articles I started on some rare diseases. The phenomenon of admins sitting atop the stack of new articles and swiping out anything that doesnt meet rather stupid criteria strikes me as crushingly evil when it comes to rare disease. I say stupid in the best since, like the internet itself is robust because its stupid. But the disease are rare! It takes a long time to develop information about them, and theres a lot of them. It takes a really long time to develop information about all of them. And it takes a LOT of expertise to know anything about them. So the nature of the content makes it extremely difficult to begin with, let alone having to deal with some vultures sitting there looking for any excuse to increase their own apparant authority by stomping on the work of others. I thought wikis werent supposed to delete content?

One way to bring in new users would be to further categorize the pages in need of expert attention. If you could present, or make available to immunologists, the immunology pages that really needed their help, you could stand to start recruiting some very highly talented people. It would require some comparison of the requires expert attention category, the categories themselves, and all the stub categories.

Nonsense. We have some perfectly reasonable words for it. There is an answer. However, it is a very unpleasant answer, so I will not speak its name.
 
What do you mean by opening up the Boards inner workings? If you mean giving more attention to the venture capital investment involved, I heartily endorse that plan :-).

They insist that, with all their work, they deserve an official job or a special title.
 
One need of Wikipedians, which is not met by the current culture, is for there to be some kind of token  or title  that can be used to show that, yes, this person is an accepted member of the Wikipedia community. Because anyone can edit Wikipedia, there is no real value in saying something along the lines of I made major contributions that greatly improved the article on Treefrogs. Someone who is familiar with Wikipedia will know that this statement is just as likely to mean that the speaker made a lot of useless edits to the article (& which were later deleted by a more knowledgable editor) as it could mean that the speaker had made undeniable improvements to the article.
 
One result of this need is that it has transformed the duty of being an Admin into a title that proves the person is part of the core group of Wikipedia. (And this has led to Wikipedia having over 1000 Admins, but only a small percentage who actually do Admin chores.)
 
It is human nature to need some kind of initiation ceremony to feel part of a group. And until this need is acknowledged & some kind of title created (even one as simple as Wikipedian in good standing), Wikipedians will feel that they are doing a lot of work yet also feel excluded from the club.

Seth, dont you think thats just a little bit harsh and extreme?  Maximum Supreme Leader? moneybag members?  Come on now, wikipedia isnt some sort of crime syndicate or something.  Jimbo mostly stays out of day-to-day decisions as much as he can, leaving the community to frame Wikipedia policy.  And most policy decisions, especially those about content, are right there in the open, on a wiki, for everyone to examine and criticize.

Well, its not exactly a polite way of phrasing the situation, but Im trying to get the point across in contrast to the fantasy of Server Farm revolutionary commune.
 
In fact, a crime syndicate is an example more meaningful than you may think - in real life, its often made up of semi-autonomous groups that while there may be a Boss Of Bosses, most day-to-day decisions are done by the community (which means the lower-ranking members in their domains). The Big Boss doesnt have time to listen to every little gripe and beef. Disputants are expected to come to a consensus within certain broad rules, with community expulsion (or worse) otherwise as an incentive.
 
Wikipedia has a head honcho. Its Wales. OK, hes not a micromanager. But he does have the absolute, final word. Sure, hes not martinet style. But many CEOs arent martinets either. Theres just little drama to be had in reporting on a CEO who is a delegator-manager type.
 
The Boards permanent members are businessmen. Not activists. Thats simply a fact. Theres at least $4 million dollars in venture capital investment. Thats not rainbows.
 
I understand the appeal of supposedly being part of the avant-garde, the New New Thing, of being so cool youre outside the scale of temperature, so far ahead youre off the map.
 
Working for free on somebody elses hyped project isnt it.

Well Seth, you could name the Words Which Must Not Be Spoken, or continue to lord over everyone that you know something too unpleasant for us ordinary folk to deal with. ;)
 
At the risk of idly philosophizing having just read Grabers _Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology_, I think its correct to consider Wikipedia consistent with an anarchistic worldview. Apparently, a major strain in anarchism is that you increase self-management within the existing order; revolution as a discrete event can often be a constraining mindset.
 
In the case of Wikipedia, I think the Gnu Free Documentation License makes it difficult for the higher-ups to take advantage of some powers. And whenever Ive contributed, Ive felt I could cooperate on an equal footing with others, as long as I stand up for myself and accept they too have their own viewpoints they wish to offer.
 
I cant operate 100% autonomously; so for example, one probably couldnt legally post the text of vital works like Bernays Propaganda, but gradual improvements to the systems in which we live are more to the point, I think

Im trying not to be more inflammatory than Ive been already 1/2 :-).
 
Im all for incremental reform. But the US remains a capitalist economy, which limits how much of a revolution it is to work for free when somebody blows smoke at you.
 
I keep saying this: I cannot consider anything with an unarguable Top Guy and a businessman-controlled Board of Directors and associated investors to be consistent with an anarchistic worldview, except perhaps in the most trivial sense of any loosely organized group.
 
Getting people to believe they make a difference is a key way to get them to volunteer. Theres nothing wrong with volunteering. But nothing particularly new either (though theres some interesting twists in what can be effective in having people volunteer )

With all respect, I think anarchism is trivial, and there are many examples of autonomous spaces in daily life. ;) Theres nothing deep about it  anarchists have even been criticized for lacking theory. So as Graeber claims:
 
Of course, Im no expert on anarchist thinkers, and I wouldnt call myself an anarchist. But I think your entire vocabulary is quite different from many of them, at least many modern ones who in my view have something interesting to say. It seems pragmatic and process-oriented. (Though some might attempt to articulate a possible vision like Parecon, as its rather depressing otherwise). In an interview, Graeber goes on to claim:
 
But anyway, since Im not entirely sure what the unpleasant answer you hinted at earlier is, perhaps the case is that youve successfully baited people like me into responding with boringly long posts, and Ill end that now. ;)

Seth is trolling. The at least $4 million dollars in venture capital investment number matches investment in wikia.com, Jimbos wiki business (which employs a lot of Wikipedias formerly volunteer sysadmins - the most experienced Mediawiki admins in the world) - but theres no venture capital investment in Wikipedia, nor mechanism for such.

Tayssir: The trivial meaning seems hardly worth discussion. Loosely organized is much less distracting (but also less dramatic).
 
David Gerard: Au contraire, I would say wikia.com is exactly the mechanism for venture capital investment in Wikipedia (in the sense relevant to this discussion). In fact, you just demonstrated why and how: employs a lot of Wikipedias formerly volunteer sysadmins). Its quite common to have an non-profit and an associated for-profit, precisely to due to the different accounting requirements.
 
Let me repost part of a comment I made an earlier thread, where I gave a link regarding the investors, and its clear that refers to wikia.com (I didnt give it in this thread, because didnt want to be accused of spamming it, damned-if-do-damned-if-I-dont):
 
Whats really interesting about Wikipedia is how:
 
1) It manages NOT TO PAY almost anyone, getting people to donate their services, on the basis of community or other ideas.
 
2) Its developed elaborate intellectual defenses against the failings of #1, whenever the flaws show through.
 
Those are two aspects which are, if not exactly completely novel, definitely innovative implementations of eternal themes.
 
Lets again recall theres $4 million of venture capital invested in the associated Wikia venture, and at a rule of thumb of 10x return, the investors want at least $40 million. Thats got to come from somewhere, and figuring out how to get work for free seems like a major part of it.
 
You may not like this, but I think its an intelligent, sourced, and well-argued critique. And calling it trolling strikes me as an attempt to discredit that material via an unjustified accusation of intellectual dishonesty.

Seth, you should have been at Wikimania (if you werent).  There were a couple of good talks about what makes Wikipedia work, and what makes it valuable.  I think your money-centered outlook on these questions is misleading you.  I get far more out of wikipedia than I put into it.  This is true for almost all of the users, who, as Aarons research points out, are really the ones contributing content.  So while from a purely selfish point of view, assuming I gained no psychological reward from sharing knowledge with the world, I could beat the system by not contributing anything, and just using Wikipedia as a read-only source.  But its not as if Jimmy Wales is ripping anyone off either way.  The content is all out there.  Its all GFDL.  Theres a real public benefit.  And if a few board members can make a bit of cash running Wikia on the side, I say whatever.  Start your own competing project, or try to get involved in Wikipedia governance, as Aaron is doing.  But this doom-and-gloom stuff about how the Wikimedia foundation is taking advantage of us all is kind of tiring.

Jacob, I thought of going to Wikimania, but for various reasons I eventually decided it would be a bad idea. What would be the point for me to attend sessions on Why Kool-Aid is the most nutritious food in the world, you should drink lots of it, and even work for free in the sugar harvest to bring this miracle powder to the starving masses of Africa. Seriously, what good would come of it? I know people get stars in their eyes.
 
You put in time and work, and you dont get out money. Thats very important structurally. Of course some people do that at times, for the psychological reward. At its best, its called volunteering. At its worst, its called some other things.
 
Its trivial to point out that all the users contributing content enjoy doing it. If they didnt enjoy it (or have some other reason), they wouldnt do it. The unpleasant issue is that this may not be an unalloyed good - and theres lots of incentives, including financial ones, not to think about that.
 
I dont want to be excessively contentious, but I see a very disturbing manipulative pattern. Wikipedia is not yours - it is Wales, it is the business members of boards. You have exactly as much power as they let you have, based on how much you are useful to them, and no more. Anything about how youre part of (my phrase) some revolutionary commune rings alarm bells with me. Thats a classic sales pitch that tends to eventually work out poorly for everyone except the few Glorious Leaders Of The Revolution.

Seth said:

The point is, in this case, theres some quid pro quo.  Im useful to them, and theyre useful to me.  Wales et al have only as much power as we give to them.  Wikipedia is all GFDL licensed.  That means the content is not owned like other property.  If I want to take all that content out and do something else with it, Im free to do so.  If I want to fork Wikipedia, Im free to try it.  Sure, theres politics involved.  Encyclopedia articles arent some exhaustable resource thats being taken away from us and hoarded away by the Wikimedia foundation.

Aaron, as Seth says, youre drinking the kool-aid.  The value of Wikipedia will be that by being first and allowing anyone to contribute, it collected a whole bunch of seed content.  That seed content will then be taken by others and used to grow another encyclopedia with better editing and contributing controls or other specialized encyclopedia websites (one devoted just to technical subjects, for example).  Wikipedia will either adapt to these new realities or will wither and die as people move on.  The lack of structure that you describe cannot sustain the massive size that Wikipedia has reached.  All that needs to happen is for someone or some group of people to realize this and start their own site.

If I may, I would like to add 2 worth here on Socialism, Anarchism, and the American way, (Corporatism).
 
Wikipedia appeals to something within me that I express in other forums, the need - within myself - to share what I have so that all I encounter can be as wealthy as I am. That is a form of Socialism & IMHO, the world - (& America, in particular) - could use more of it.
 
I spend time helping people online fix computer-related problems and I do it for no financial remuneration, I do it for the payment I value most, the ability to feel I am doing something worth a damn in a world where everything seems to have a pricetag attached.
 
I believe there are a LOT of people in the world just like me, and given a chance and the time to do so, are willing - make that driven - to do exactly what I do, share whatever knowledge, skills, and expertice they have, so that the world can become a better, more edumacated, and smoother functioning place to live and operate from day to day.
 
In the end, having a Wikipedia around saves me money. I own several old and outdated encyclopedias and would be continually upgrading them were not Wiki here for my use. I SAVE MONEY, therefore Wiki is a good deal for me, even though I spend valuable time in returning payment by helping to add to the compendium of knowledge it represents.
 
What it represents is a willingness, (and a guilt-driven in some cases - people DO have a conscience about not paying for things they use & benefit from), to expend fair value to to have something available that benefits them personally. Its selfish in the extreme, but the amount of payment, while not measurable in Dollars/Euros,Pesos etc., is of worth and just as Wiki itself is run, allows a sense of FROM each according to his Needs and TO each according to his Deeds to occur without the harsh feelings coercive payments or taxation brings about.
 
In the end, anarchy - the freedom to do whatever we believe is right - is served in the open ability to add/subtract to Wiki, and Corporatism is served by returning value on investment, (time spent), and Socialism is served, by giving to those who do not have but need, by those with an excess they may not need and are willing to freely share.
 
In the end it matters little to those of us doing the sharing, because we receive an equitable value, and it matters little to those of us who do the taking, because we DEFINATELY receive equitable value, whether or not there is some mysterious backer(s) making a little or a handful of loot from Wikipedia in one way or another. As long as we get what we want and need, society and our own selfish interests are served. 
It appears to be a Win/Win to me, and gripping about fiscal exchanges or hidden motivations seems pointless in the extreme.
It works, leave well enough alone eh?
 
Long Live the Wiki.

It is basic physics knowledge that world has a tendency towards chaos rather than discipline. At first it seemed that wikipedia was a perfectly growing website but as the website grows and becomes more precious than ever, basic physics law starts to show up again. Editing is necessary, but within limits. If not chaos or unhappyness is unpreventable.

Very interesting points of argument I see floating around here. And I was directed to this blog by watching a very good intellectual discussion on [URL=http://mitworld.mit.edu/play/492/]collective intelligence[/URL] from MIT, which wikipedia was perhaps the centerfold of attention.
 
Were approaching the extreme of a freedom revolution in our midst and I find that certain things are very important to make a point about.
 
1) There is a great need to route out collective idiocy/ignorance, which threatens to hinder both the productivity and potentiality of the global community. Part of this problem is introduced and presented by Nadiralis predicament on assuming irresponsible individuals power that they use to exploit in their own selfish ways.
 
Applying this problem physically, it is a polarization of such- Wikipedia, as a core hub of potentially energizing the mind with knowledge, faces the problem of negative input, giving us negative output. Wikipedia is merely a medium for information flow. As a result, anything that is put into it is what flows out directly. (This is perhaps what may arise the need for admins to filter out the negative, but Ill bring that up later on in this response too)
 
The main reason Wikipedia is such a positive entity is the fact that people see the positive potential in using it to help out communities.
 
I think part of Seths dysfunction is not seeing this, and only seeing the possibility for extracting maximum money flow through exploiting and whittling your way into a profitable position (which Im sure hes exposed to and is inferring towards the corruptible nature of the business industry- more bang for your buck. Also known as externalities in this case.) But in the case of Jimmy Wales and the ones who recieve monetary fund from contributors, I find it practically justified for maintaining such an amazing database. Im sure the idea itself is worth what people contributed. And sure, why not give some money to someone who has helped out humanity in such a positive way? Better off giving them some cash to live off of rather than directly to exploitative corporations that profit solely on back-breaking labor!
 
Of course, this is the main problem in any system: being corrupted by too much negativity and ending with negative returns (which is what were seeing with all this pollution, cancer, disease, deforestation, warfare, etc.. going around in the world). But I find that the architecture of Wikipedia is created to route out that problem at its source. And once experts in the various specializations of academics utilize Wikipedia and acknowledge its potential, well have a universal learning tool that may even evolve into something much greater and more refined.
 
I can actually see a database arising as a successor to Wikipedia- one that starts categorization of such knowledge into a tree-form architecture. And this is partly inspired by this website: http://www.lecturefox.com/
 
Someone somewhere is bound to find the idea to link together the two parts, and I see something like having a layout of informative works as well as having videos to help explain the information. So essentially, were ending up with a multimedia tool that has the possibility of even evolve itself further into the rising internet revolution.
 
2) Economic stabilization is required. This is perhaps the most important part of the freedom revolution. In order to this, we need to restructure our society and the means of functioning into a way that doesnt require monetary funds for sustainability. Part of what I see is that Wikipedia is practically devoid of this. You are free to harness the information and use it accordingly to your own will. I literally see Wikipedia as a microcosm of anarchy in action. And Ive been told that practical anarchy will never work and cant, but I know that to be naive ignorance of the ego telling me this.
 
And perhaps the strongest argument is the the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution]Spanish Revolution[/url]. They operated without monetary fund for the most part. Who is to say that this cant happen on a macroscale equivalent?
 
3) An abundance of resources needs to arise. As 6 billion people on this planet, we have the full capability of exponentially raising the output of energy. We have the capability end poverty and warfare, and all that other negativity that is destroying the essence of life on this planet. But we need to work for it. We have to be positive about it, and not selfish. The alternatives already exist, we just need to make it materialize and bring it to fruition.
 
Such things that have been known for decades now are energy farming (such as hemp farming), permaculture food farming, and now the research into free-energy, also known as cold-fusion, or low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR). More about this can be found at www.infinite-energy.com
 
Also, patent #6126794 is an example of a way we can get off of using harmful, radioactive nuclear energy and more on hydrogen energy.
 
This specific type of energy converter has been kept well secret throughout the automotive industry (because of the oil monopoly). We have the power to run cars on water!
 
So truly, in the next couple years, we should see these new forms of massive, free-energy arising. And it will literally put an end to the necessity of relying of money monopolization to run our world. Money is the root of all evil and I see it being systematically rooted out through our own intuition to find alternatives!
 
Now going back to the first part of my post, I find that collective idiocy will be systematically removed the more time goes on. The more we absorb the shock of all the negativity in the planet and transform it into positive outputs, the less we will see of ignorance and the hinderance towards a new way of life versus the death culture that plagues us with cancer, disease, sickness, and other physiological and psychological dysfunctions.
 
Were on the bring of the Kingdom of Heaven, and at this point, being greedy and trying to exploit humanity to be selfish is only causing the destruction of the individual, not the communities.
 
And Ill end with the most powerful quote I know:
 
When the power of Love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace. -Jimi Hendrix

Title: False Outliers
 
So far my Wikipedia script has churned through about 200 articles, calculating who wrote what in each. This morning I looked through them to see if there were any that didnt match my theory. It printed out a couple and I decided to investigate.
 
The first it found was Alkane, a long technical article about acyclic saturated hydrocarbons that it said was largely written by Physchim62. Yesterday a good friend was telling me that he thought long technical articles were likely written by a single person, so I immediately thought that here was the proof that he was right. But, just to check, I decided to look in the edit history to make sure my script hadnt made an error.
 
It hadnt, I found, but once again simply looking at the numbers missed the larger point. Physchim62 had indeed contributed most of the article, but according to the edit comments, it was by translating the German version! I dont have the German data, but presumably it was written in the same incremental way as most of the articles in my study.
 
The next serious case was Characters in Atlas Shrugged, which the script said was written by CatherineMunro. Again, it seemed plausible that one person could have written all those character bios. But again, an investigation into the actual edit history found that Munro hadnt written them, instead shed copied them from a bunch of subpages, merging them into one bigger page.
 
The final serious example was Anchorage, Alaska, which appeared to have been written by JeffreyAllen1975. Here the contributions seemed quite genuine; JeffreyAllen1975 made tons of edits each contributing a paragraph at a time. The work seemed to take quite a toll on him; at his user page he noted I just got burned-out and tired of the online encyclopedia. My time is being taken away from me by being with Wikipedia. He lasted about four months.
 
Still, something seemed fishy about JeffreyAllen1975, so I decided to investigate further. Currently, the Anchorage page has a tag noting that The current version of the article or section reads like an advertisement. A bit of Googling revealed why: JeffreyAllen1975s contributions had been copied-and-pasted from other websites, like the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce (Anchorages public school system is ranked among the best in the nation.  The districts average SAT and ACT College entrance exam scores are consistently above the national average and Advanced Placement courses are offered at each of the districts larger high schools.).
 
I suspect JeffreyAllen1975 didnt know what he was doing; his writing style suggests hes just a kid: In my free time, I am very proud of my-self by how much Ive learned by making good edits on Wikipedia articles. Im pretty sure he just thought he was helping the project: Wikipedia is like the real encyclopedia books (A thru Z) that you see in the library, but better. But his plagiarism will still have to be removed.
 
When I started, just looking at the numbers these seemed to be several cases that strongly contradicted my theory. And had I just stuck to looking at the numbers, I would have believed that to be the case as well. But, once again, investigation shows the picture to be far more interesting: translation, reorganization, and plagiarism. Exciting stuff!

The worlds always more interesting than the numbers suggest.
 
The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers - Richard W. Hamming
 
The orginal basic insight is still standing - theres a staff, which does copyediting, and subject-matter writers.
 
Whats youve found, at a more refined level of investigation, is that some of the people who might have been thought to be the original writers are in fact simply relays (translators or plagiarists) from the true original writers.
 
Which is indeed interesting. Especially since its more likely these primary writers were in fact paid.

Interesting.  I hope you keep a record of the metric used to identify outliers, what happened on further inspection of each outlier, and any interesting results from further inspection of an equal number of non-outliers

That Anchorage article was a wacky case (I just deleted all revisions since late 2005); the poor guy must have put as much effort into finding all those different websites to copy from, and mixing and matching the content like that, as he would have into writing an original article.  Weird
 
Your observations in this whole series, by the way, tally with whats been my anecdotal experience with the articles Ive worked on; most raw content is added by IP editors or occasional contributors, most formatting is done by regulars.  I would be interested, however, in seeing you run this on articles with good references, since I think thats what we need to be focusing on now.
 
But, in any event, you got my vote with this

Title: Who Writes Wikipedia?  Responses
 
(back to Who writes Wikipedia?)
 
First, on a personal note, let me simply say thanks. I probably put more work yesterdays post than anything else Ive ever written. In addition to the research I describe, Ive spent my free time the past few weeks going over the text of the article again and again, agonizing about the proper phrasing, getting everything just right. It was definitely worth it. My sincere thanks to everyone who made it possible.
 
Getting down to business, many are interested in pursuing this line of quantitative research. The work I did was intended for an article, not a formal paper, and while Im fairly confident the basic principles are correct theres plenty more work to be done.
 
I was heartened to discover research by Seth Anthony which, independently and more formally, came to largely the same conclusions. As he explained on Reddit: Only about 10% of all edits on Wikipedia actually add substantive content. Roughly a third of those edits are made by someone without an account, half of someone without a userpage (a minimal threshhold for considering whether someone is part of the community). The average content-adder has less than 200 edits: much less, in many cases.
 
One of the more interesting things Anthony did was look at the work of admins in detail. In his sample, he noticed that none of the genuinely substantive edits were done by official site admins. He found that when admins originally joined the site, they contributed a lot less frequently and consistently but created a lot more substantive content. After they became admins, however, they turned into what Anthony calls janitors.
 
One of the wonderful things about Wikipedia is that literally all of the data  every single edit and practically every discussion made on or about the site  is easily available. So theres an enormous amount more to learn about how it gets written. (In addition to nailing down what we know so far a little better.) If youre interested to contributing to further research on this and related topics, send me an email and Ill try to coordinate something.
 
Another response was to think about the implications on who gets to vote in Wikipedia elections. I tried to vote, commented Eric, but since I am one of your occasional contributors (Ive edited only one article to make content changes), I am not eligible[]. It appears that the opinions of occasional contributors will not be heard. Others, including William Loughborough and Jason Clark, expressed similar sentiments. HURRAH, I am DISENFRANCHISED, complained Bill Coderre.
 
But by far the most common response was people sharing their experience trying to contribute to Wikipedia, only to see their contributions be quickly reverted or rewritten.
 
You can definately tell the regulars on Wikipedia, joshd noted. Theyre the ones who  delete your newly reate[d] article without hesitation, or revert your changes and accuse you of vandalis[m] without even checking the changes you made. Every modification I made was deleted without any comment, complained CafeCafe. I know there are a lot of people like me willing to help, but unless there is a real discussion behind, I wont waste my time to help anymore which is a sad thing.
 
bowerbird complained that my contributions  have been warped by people who merely want to make it sound like an encyclopedia without having any knowledge of the topic while Ian got fed up of the self-appointed officious jobsworths who [rewrite your] things [to] fit their vision  . My time is too valuable to argue with these people
 
Bill Coderre told of how he wrote entire articles from scratch, only to see them ruined by some super-editors, who removed content, and turned what I thought was gosh-darn good writing into crap.  These people, by and large, edited thousands of articles. In most cases, these edits were to remove material that they found unsuitable. Indeed, some of the people-history pages contained little awards that people gave each other  for removing content from Wikipedia.
 
And it seems like half of all the people I meet have a story about being listed for deletion and the nasty insults that ensued. Seriously, there have been numerous times Ive said something about Wikipedia to a relatively well-known person and they responded back with a story about how someone insulted and deleted them. [T]here are culture vultures overlooking Wkidpedia waiting to kill anything that doesnt fit the norm, wrote Mediangler.
 
Why does this matter? Why should we listen to the angry complaints of random people on the Internet? If occasional contributors are the lifeblood of Wikipedia, as the evidence suggests, then alienating such people just cant be healthy for the project. As Ian wrote, if we are to invest our valuable time contributing some expert knowledge on some subject, we want to know that our work will remain there for others, and not just keep getting reverted out in seconds by some control freak that knows nothing about the actual subject.  your article proves the exist[e]nce of this inner gang that I feel are actually holding Wikipedia back. To allow Wikipedia to grow and really pick the brains of the experts around the world, you need to do something to break up this inner gang and the mini empires they are building for themselves.
 
Perhaps we can improve things with new rules (not only should you not bite the newcomers, you shouldnt even bark at them) and new software (making it easier to discuss changes and defend contributions), but most importantly, its going to require a cultural shift. Larry Sanger famously suggested that Wikipedia must jettison its anti-elitism so that experts could feel more comfortable contributing. I think the real solution is the opposite: Wikipedians must jettison their elitism and welcome the newbie masses as genuine contributors to the project, as people to respect, not filter out.

Why does this matter? Why should we listen to the 
  angry complaints of random people on the Internet?
 
That is actually a lot more imortant than just being a rhetorical question. You have linked to a lot of claims, but before taking any of them at face value, you should investigate them. And I am not saying this to  insult the people that commented, but because of my own experience administrating/moderating a medium sized community (small by wikipedia standards).
As you would know from politics, there is radically different ways of looking at and describing certain actions and deletions. And it is especially the casual users that (obviously) lack detailed knowledge on rules and conventions (again, this is not put anybody down, its quite normal for people who do not invest time into a project/community). I mean, everybody agrees that those people shouldnt feel that way; disagreements are on how to achieve that end (in balance with the other goals).
 
One more thing: You seem to have learned your lesson from following politics.;) You bring up a common issue that is suffcicently generally phrased so that many people can identify with it. (Yeah, I wrote something once, and somebody else edited it out). Yet, even if you had actually proposed measures against the problem (which you didnt), those measures couly only affect a minority of edits - because by and large (I am guessing here) the big majority of edits seem actually necessary to most people familiar with Wikipedia, including probably you. Would you actually improve the situation such, that all those people that you quote from the comments, would have a better experience next time? Hard to say, because you neither you nor I actually which rules those people ran up against.
 
Being newbie friendly (which I feel is where this going at) all the time is a super-hard job, and finding people that want to (or even are able to) spend a lot of their time being newbie-friendly is exceptionally hard. The problem here is not process or rules, its the sheer amount of newbies and their (on average) stupidity. Are you familiar with the usenet expression the eternal september?
 
I am sure I dont have to link to Shirkys piece on the worst enemy of a group. Ill just quote No. 2 of his conclusions - though Ill leave it open on how to interpret and apply that to Wikipedia:
 
2.) The second thing you have to accept: Members
   are different than users. A pattern will arise 
  in which there is some group of users that cares
   more than average about the integrity and 
  success of the group as a whole. And that 
  becomes your core group, Art Kleiners phrase 
  for the group within the group that matters 
  most.
 
I would be interested in how you bring this together with how you would want to see Wikipedia organized in terms of rules, process or people (if you agree with Shirky on that, that is).

I think Sencers comment brings a bit of balance to the discussion but as somebody who has had material immediately reversed out on wikipedia - it was around a piece of corporate information - I would like to assure you it happened and it was shocking how quicly it happened. My concern with that is it felt liek censorship. What can be done differently - I think there has to be scope to allow competing or divergent views on a subject or issue such that the keeper of the main post cannot be the keeper of a divergent post.

I wondered about the following,
 
Still Gang of 500 or 1000 might remain strong or good enough even you get a position. What are the substantial analysis about those people? Who are they, and why they came to behave and act such ways? Is that how experts grow and come to hold certain mindsets? (Lewontin, I think, talk about this problem[not solutions or answers though].) Or what they went through? how it looks from their positions and their side of stories? No effective communication possible with those who labeled as gangs?
 
And by getting you elected, how that could/would really, substantially change? You need to persuade 500 gangs - or you dont have to do that, you just can keep low entry setting open, and software design tweaks, and then - that kind of 500 gangs would just - change? (or melt away?)
 
Before saying like Alienating the world, can we know about how Jimbo Wales and his 400 or 500 close Wiki tops are talking, discussing? Are those discussions contents are accessible to everyone? or not? (No Monthly letter from Wiki HQ? But we only have Jimbos rubber stamp talks at several hundreds locations?)
 
Arent these related to the issue of handling of POVs - neutrality, impartiality and so on?
 
Maybe more fine point, but maybe also crucial, is, like old? - Ward Cunninghams Wiki had no deletion encouraged policy, even advanced users, or gangs werent encouraged to do that. It said its against Wikis spirit. Rather, if you are advanced,
 
1: you need to be able to handle newbies, and get them to learn how to do difficult stuff. (say POVs handling, moderation over disagreement)
 
2: dont delete - keep it somewhere recorded and work from there, with newbies/someone with (radically?) different perspective, information, opinion and so on.
 
And they talked about this as important thing, so that Wiki wont become something like UseNet, which sank itself into regular flamers roaming pool. (How that happened? - among people. UseNet had some ideals and spirits too)
 
I wonder how not to repeat, what could give us, assist us to bring change in all this.

Great set of posts, thanks.
 
I dont know what kind of mining efforts there have been on the wiki corpus so far, but I can offer a couple of suggestions that spring to mind.
 
Im often driven to distraction by wikipedias clumsy prose.  A random example: Since 1992, the current leader and Secretary-General of Hezbollah is Sheikh Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.  It would be interesting to focus on those edits that dont alter the substance of a sentence.  E.g., I ran that one through Lingua::LinkParser, and it failed.  But then I fixed it up a bit, and it parsed just fine: Sheikh Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been the leader and Secretary-General of Hezbollah since 1992.  In a perfect world, youd have a routine to preemptively suggest better grammar. But in our imperfect world, authors should get fine-grained feedback about these problems.
 
On a related note, I notice an awful lot of passive voice on wikipedia.  It is claimed that [Anderson] Cooper doesnt drink hot beverages or His height is reported to be no more than 5 10.  A lot of that may simply indicate unsourced claims, but I suspect overall theres more to it: that its a form of defensive prose, perhaps to ward off summary deletions.  It would be fun to compare a sample of authors wiki posts to their blog posts, if that information were available, to spot any interesting grammatical differences.
 
I also wonder if theres been any fine-grained analysis of the more volatile pages, the ones whose content changes the most.  Can this lead to any predictive routines about a texts level of controversy?  Perhaps even more useful information than a section-level notice of a dispute.  I nooded around with a routine to stratify argument threads within blog comment sections, but didnt get this far.  I assume others have worked on this problem, though.

Bravo for this series of Wikipedia articles and the research behind them, Aaron. I for one was terribly dissapointed to find that I was ineligible to vote for you. I wonder how many Wikipedia super-editors would have the knowledge required to knit together the genetics, pathology, biochemistry, and related articles that I have. It is also apparently to bad for me that I do many of my edits from the medical library computers and dont bother to sign into Wikipedia before making the edits as well. (This is also from a library computer, so maybe you can find how many Wikipedia edits are from the block of IP addresses that this letter is sent from.)

Aaron, this isnt a wikipedia election. Its a Wikimedia Foundation election. Theres a difference: one is the name its authors give to the content its known for, the other is the web host for the content. With some people involved in both.

The vast majority of these complaints against wikipedia are complaints for which there are no possible solutions.
 
My article got deleted, therefore wikipedia sucks.  I added content to an article, which was promptly removed, therefore wikipedia sucks.  I took some content out of an article which I thought was false, and it was put right back in, therefore wikipedia sucks.
 
How can any of the above possibly go any differently?  Articles are going to be deleted, as wikipedia cannot simply have articles on everything, from my dog Bonkers to George Bush is a tard!.  Editors are going to disagree with one another and revert each others edits, that is the nature of wikis.
 
As for all the I couldnt vote, I dont have enough edits, this is unfair, how else is vote stacking going to be prevented?  If people with few or no edits can vote, they can make 1000 accounts and stuff the ballot for their candidate.
 
These complaints are like someone new to the process of driving saying, This road system sucks, I want to be able to drive on both sides of the road, and these stop signs and stop lights are wasting everyones time, and other drivers are driving badly and I hate that and something should be done, and also I dont want to ever get a traffic ticket, and the roads should be 10 times wider, except my taxes shouldnt be raised to pay for those wide roads.

xyzzyplughs analogy to driving unintentionally illustrates one of the big flaws common in community developed knowledge basesthe tendency for groupthink to oppose ideas that run contrary to that which everyone knows.  There is evidence to suggest that removing traffic lights, stop signs, lane markers, etc. actually improves safety and reduces accidents.  See the story on one such experiment, in The Netherlands, here:

I hate wiki, and know at least a couple dozen professionals like myself who work in our respective fields who also groan or wince a little whenever wiki is merely mentioned.
 
And I think that the wiki people know what the problem is, I mean, come on guys, all you need to do is look at who it is thats deleting and abusing new contributors.  But nobody is ever actually held accountable, and wiki quickly takes on the feel to newcomers of a really crappy and elitist early 90s BBS.
 
Now that wiki is removing so many useful links, many of them which clearly show that the little wiki nazis have edited the article to be decidedly on-NPOV, wiki has become a really sad joke.
 
Good luck with removing links and telling specialists in their fields that they cant make corrections, and with the little awards for what, for making entries not just mediocre, but inaccurate and in many cases absurd.

I am an expert in a particular field.  I found the quality of wikipedia information highly variable.  Some articles were good.  Others had inaccurate and sometimes completely wrong information.
 
Still other articles are zealously guarded by a group who are able to effectively censor information through a variety of techniques.  This discourages experts.  As a result, I only contribute occasionally.  When I do, its for unimportant stuff, like cartoon characters and TV shows.

Wikipedia run by 12 year old schoolboys for 12 year old schoolboys.
 
I am not joking I had a lot of work deleted by a 13 year old, with numerous wiki medals.
 
I promptly left the site.
 
Do yourself a favour use proper resources such as libraries, actual websites or proper encylopedias
such as Britannica.
 
Also dont donate money to wiki until they become a geniune resource aimed at there customers rather than an unaccountable inner elite.

To be honest, Wikipedia is a place where, if more users agree with you on anything, they become correct. It doesnt matter if its a picture of a penis ejaculating ont he front page of a ejaculation page, if dogs are used as meat in the US, or if Christian bands play Christian music. Wikipedias editors have no creditials. Im saying this because I used to edit Wikipedia for years until I realized that what I did had little effect on anything.

Title: Who Writes Wikipedia?
 
Wikimedia 2006 Elections
 

Part 1: Wikimedia at the Crossroads
Part 2: Who Writes Wikipedia?
Part 3: Who Runs Wikipedia?
Part 4: Making More Wikipedians
Part 5: Making More Wikipedias
Part 6: Code, and Other Laws

 
Translations: , Espaol, Deutsch, Franais (add)
 
Vote for me in the election for the Wikimedia Foundations Board of Directors.
 
I first met Jimbo Wales, the face of Wikipedia, when he came to speak at Stanford. Wales told us about Wikipedias history, technology, and culture, but one thing he said stands out. The idea that a lot of people have of Wikipedia, he noted, is that its some emergent phenomenon  the wisdom of mobs, swarm intelligence, that sort of thing  thousands and thousands of individual users each adding a little bit of content and out of this emerges a coherent body of work. But, he insisted, the truth was rather different: Wikipedia was actually written by a community  a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers where I know all of them and they all know each other. Really, its much like any traditional organization.
 
The difference, of course, is crucial. Not just for the public, who wants to know how a grand thing like Wikipedia actually gets written, but also for Wales, who wants to know how to run the site. For me this is really important, because I spend a lot of time listening to those four or five hundred and if  those people were just a bunch of people talking  maybe I can just safely ignore them when setting policy and instead worry about the million people writing a sentence each.
 
So did the Gang of 500 actually write Wikipedia? Wales decided to run a simple study to find out: he counted who made the most edits to the site. I expected to find something like an 80-20 rule: 80% of the work being done by 20% of the users, just because that seems to come up a lot. But its actually much, much tighter than that: it turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users  524 people.  And in fact the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits. The remaining 25% of edits, he said, were from people who [are] contributing  a minor change of a fact or a minor spelling fix  or something like that.
 
Stanford wasnt the only place hes made such a claim; its part of the standard talk he gives all over the world. This is the group of around a thousand people who really matter, he told us at Stanford. There is this tight community that is actually doing the bulk of all the editing, he explained at the Oxford Internet Institute. Its a group of around a thousand to two thousand people, he informed the crowd at GEL 2005. These are just the three talks I watched, but Wales has given hundreds more like them.
 
At Stanford the students were skeptical. Wales was just counting the number of edits  the number of times a user changed something and clicked save. Wouldnt things be different if he counted the amount of text each user contributed? Wales said he planned to do that in the next revision, but was sure my results are going to be even stronger, because hed no longer be counting vandalism and other changes that later got removed.
 
Wales presents these claims as comforting. Dont worry, he tells the world, Wikipedia isnt as shocking as you think. In fact, its just like any other project: a small group of colleagues working together toward a common goal. But if you think about it, Waless view of things is actually much more shocking: around a thousand people wrote the worlds largest encyclopedia in four years for free? Could this really be true?
 
Curious and skeptical, I decided to investigate. I picked an article at random (Alan Alda) to see how it was written. Today the Alan Alda page is a pretty standard Wikipedia page: it has a couple photos, several pages of facts and background, and a handful of links. But when it was first created, it was just two sentences: Alan Alda is a male actor most famous for his role of Hawkeye Pierce in the television series MASH. Or recent work, he plays sensitive male characters in drama movies. How did it get from there to here?
 
Edit by edit, I watched the page evolve. The changes I saw largely fell into three groups. A tiny handful  probably around 5 out of nearly 400  were vandalism: confused or malicious people adding things that simply didnt fit, followed by someone undoing their change. The vast majority, by far, were small changes: people fixing typos, formatting, links, categories, and so on, making the article a little nicer but not adding much in the way of substance. Finally, a much smaller amount were genuine additions: a couple sentences or even paragraphs of new information added to the page.
 
Wales seems to think that the vast majority of users are just doing the first two (vandalizing or contributing small fixes) while the core group of Wikipedians writes the actual bulk of the article. But thats not at all what I found. Almost every time I saw a substantive edit, I found the user who had contributed it was not an active user of the site. They generally had made less than 50 edits (typically around 10), usually on related pages. Most never even bothered to create an account.
 
To investigate more formally, I purchased some time on a computer cluster and downloaded a copy of the Wikipedia archives. I wrote a little program to go through each edit and count how much of it remained in the latest version. Instead of counting edits, as Wales did, I counted the number of letters a user actually contributed to the present article.
 
If you just count edits, it appears the biggest contributors to the Alan Alda article (7 of the top 10) are registered users who (all but 2) have made thousands of edits to the site. Indeed, #4 has made over 7,000 edits while #7 has over 25,000. In other words, if you use Waless methods, you get Waless results: most of the content seems to be written by heavy editors.
 
But when you count letters, the picture dramatically changes: few of the contributors (2 out of the top 10) are even registered and most (6 out of the top 10) have made less than 25 edits to the entire site. In fact, #9 has made exactly one edit  this one! With the more reasonable metric  indeed, the one Wales himself said he planned to use in the next revision of his study  the result completely reverses.
 
I dont have the resources to run this calculation across all of Wikipedia (there are over 60 million edits!), but I ran it on several more randomly-selected articles and the results were much the same. For example, the largest portion of the Anaconda article was written by a user who only made 2 edits to it (and only 100 on the entire site). By contrast, the largest number of edits were made by a user who appears to have contributed no text to the final article (the edits were all deleting things and moving things around).
 
When you put it all together, the story become clear: an outsider makes one edit to add a chunk of information, then insiders make several edits tweaking and reformatting it. In addition, insiders rack up thousands of edits doing things like changing the name of a category across the entire site  the kind of thing only insiders deeply care about. As a result, insiders account for the vast majority of the edits. But its the outsiders who provide nearly all of the content.
 
And when you think about it, this makes perfect sense. Writing an encyclopedia is hard. To do anywhere near a decent job, you have to know a great deal of information about an incredibly wide variety of subjects. Writing so much text is difficult, but doing all the background research seems impossible.
 
On the other hand, everyone has a bunch of obscure things that, for one reason or another, theyve come to know well. So they share them, clicking the edit link and adding a paragraph or two to Wikipedia. At the same time, a small number of people have become particularly involved in Wikipedia itself, learning its policies and special syntax, and spending their time tweaking the contributions of everybody else.
 
Other encyclopedias work similarly, just on a much smaller scale: a large group of people write articles on topics they know well, while a small staff formats them into a single work. This second group is clearly very important  its thanks to them encyclopedias have a consistent look and tone  but its a severe exaggeration to say that they wrote the encyclopedia. One imagines the people running Britannica worry more about their contributors than their formatters.
 
And Wikipedia should too. Even if all the formatters quit the project tomorrow, Wikipedia would still be immensely valuable. For the most part, people read Wikipedia because it has the information they need, not because it has a consistent look. It certainly wouldnt be as nice without one, but the people who (like me) care about such things would probably step up to take the place of those who had left. The formatters aid the contributors, not the other way around.
 
Wales is right about one thing, though. This fact does have enormous policy implications. If Wikipedia is written by occasional contributors, then growing it requires making it easier and more rewarding to contribute occasionally. Instead of trying to squeeze more work out of those who spend their life on Wikipedia, we need to broaden the base of those who contribute just a little bit.
 
Unfortunately, precisely because such people are only occasional contributors, their opinions arent heard by the current Wikipedia process. They dont get involved in policy debates, they dont go to meetups, and they dont hang out with Jimbo Wales. And so things that might help them get pushed on the backburner, assuming theyre even proposed.
 
Out of sight is out of mind, so its a short hop to thinking these invisible people arent particularly important. Thus Waless belief that 500 people wrote half an encyclopedia. Thus his assumption that outsiders contribute mostly vandalism and nonsense. And thus the comments you sometimes hear that making it hard to edit the site might be a good thing.
 
Im not a wiki person who happened to go into encyclopedias, Wales told the crowd at Oxford. Im an encyclopedia person who happened to use a wiki. So perhaps his belief that Wikipedia was written in the traditional way isnt surprising. Unfortunately, it is dangerous. If Wikipedia continues down this path of focusing on the encyclopedia at the expense of the wiki, it might end up not being much of either.

This is interesting.  I came to a similar conclusion (that Wikipedia is similar to traditional encyclopedias) based on my own experiences as a contributor of traditional encyclopedia articles; see here:

Also see here for my further thoughts on the topic:

Regarding the formatting issues that you mention near the end of your article, I agree that ultimately the ocntent is more important.  But I imagine the common format is a big part of Wikipedias appealit sort of makes it into the McDonalds of information sources. I suspect that the clean and uniform format is a large part of Wikipedias air of authority.

Spot on, BUT the air of authority is quite a different matter than actual authority.
 
The good sign is that format, etc. sells tickets but content changes the world.
 
The bad sign is that those who groom this monkey seem to have taken control of the project by setting themselves up as a hierarchy via voting eligibility rules.
 
The people Aaron shows to have crafted the content are largely disenfranchised while the eyeshade editors rule.

Dont worry, he tells the world, Wikipedia isnt as shocking as you think. In fact, its just like any other project: 
 
And hes correct, though that cuts both ways. Theres an editorial staff which handles the copyediting, versus the occasional freelance contributors, who work on specific topics. That is indeed a standard model.
 
Whats really interesting about Wikipedia is how:
 
1) It manages NOT TO PAY almost anyone, getting people to donate their services, on the basis of community or other ideas.
 
2) Its developed elaborate intellectual defenses against the failings of #1, whenever the flaws show through.
 
Those are two aspects which are, if not exactly completely novel, definitely innovative implementations of eternal themes.
 
Lets again recall theres $4 million of venture capital invested in the associated Wikia venture, and at a rule of thumb of 10x return, the investors want at least $40 million. Thats got to come from somewhere, and figuring out how to get work for free seems like a major part of it.

Very insightful Aaron.
 
In fact to think of it, I guess it is this flawed understanding of the nature of the contribution process to Wikipedia which Wales harbors might be behind the recent decision by Wikipedia to ban edits by users who are not logged in.
 
I think this is one of the most regressive moves in the history of Wikipedia - by putting in a login barrier i would assume a lot of the casual (but as you pointed out, very critical) contribution is put off.
 
This type of casual contribution is at the heart of Wikipedia, and no amount of vandalism is reason enough to put barriers around this. 
It is like killing your goose which lays the golden eggs, just because you cant stop some of them from being stolen.

Interesting article, but I think youre being overly dismissive of the insiders/formatters. Because the likelihood of casual users making significant contributions is determined not only by how easy it is for casual readers to contribute, but also by how many such readers there are to begin with. And the size of that pool of readers depends to a great extent on how readable, reliable and accessible the information presented is. So a change that imposes a minor impediment to casual edits can still result in a net increase in casual editors if it also helps the insiders and formatters improve Wikipedias usability, and increase its readership.

I second what bowerbird says. I used to be one of the people making small but regular contributions to Wikipedia, on the subject of places I have lived and the London theatre scene/history, both subjects on which I have a lot to contribute, but got fed up of the self-appointed officious jobsworths who would come along minutes later and revert your contribution or substantially modify it (so that it lost the important detail), in order that things would fit their vision for the sections they patrol and have made their own. My time is too valuable to argue with these people, sit monitoring discussion pages, or fight for ages to wrestle control back (and in doing so become as bad as these people, if I were to end up spending my entire waking hours on Wikipedia as they appear to).
 
Ive also become annoyed with the behaviour of this perceived inner circle when it comes to current events and the high and mighty attitude they have to outsider contributors (not me in these cases).
 
Wikipedia was good up until 12-18 months ago but lately its become far too cliquey. Which scares a lot of knowledgeable would-be contributors off, because if we are to invest our valuable time contributing some expert knowledge on some subject, we want to know that our work will remain there for others, and not just keep getting reverted out in seconds by some control freak that knows nothing about the actual subject.
 
Why am I taking the time to make this point here? Because your article proves the existance of this inner gang that I feel are actually holding Wikipedia back. To allow Wikipedia to grow and really pick the brains of the experts around the world, you need to do something to break up this inner gang and the mini empires they are building for themselves.

As an occasional contributer Ive found largely the same thing. The super editors are the ones whom the site benefits, and, unfortunately, they share the same opinion as Wales that they are responsible for the bulk of the content. Ive proposed the addition or deletion of a couple articles, cited Wikipedia policy (two or three points in each case) and have been told point blank that I am wrong and that the other editors would agree with the editor I was arguing with. I may not spend 10 hours a day on the site or have thousands of edits under my belt, but this sort of treatment just left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and it sounds like the founder is all but condoning it.

All of the original content before it was switched to PHPWiki was done by an almost entirely different group than the people who are doing it today, so while there may be 500 active supercontributors at any one time, between 2001 and now there has been a constantly changing group of active contributors. This has an effect on both the numbers that are being used here, I think. Early on, there was only about 500 people, total contributing, but everyone was a supercontributor.
 
As a side note, it was much easier to contribute before, when you could discuss with other contributors and know that someone really had to be disruptive to be blocked. It happens way too easily now, primarily I think because of a number of truly unprofessional so-called moderators. The power imbalance now is very anti-wiki.

When I tried to vote there was a curious response:
 
Sorry, you are not qualified to vote in this election here on the English Wikipedia. You need to have made 400 edits here before 2006-08-01T00:00:00; you have made 31. Also, your first edit on this wiki was at 2005-04-29T05:57:45; it needs to be before 2006-05-03T00:00:00.
  Curious because in my understanding 2005 is before 2006. Perhaps I am misunderstanding the rule?
 
Good luck with the election.

Regardless of how many people contribute to Wikipedia content, I remain concerned about the unchecked biases of contributors.  Anyone can can make impressive-sounding citations to create an air of authority when writing/editing a topic.  But what percentage of those occasional, unregistered contributors who are subject matter experts on that topic review new contributions to verify the changes?  While this may be trivial for celebrity bios, it is particularly important for controversial scientific entries, such the standard model for physics, xenoestrogens, and global warming.
 
At least with a traditional encyclopedia publishing process, the compiling company hires people with well-established expertise to check the work of free-lance contributors.  And on the most important topics, the compiling company gets top-notch subject matter writers to begin with.  None of this is guaranteed in cyberspace.
 
As a test of my theory the problems with the lack of peer review in Wikipedia, Ive augmented a topic (with citations) on a controversial medical topic to see if anyone bothers to challenge my assertions.  It will be interesting to see the revisions of that article.

Your point is well taken, with a caveat: that its difficult to actually quantify particular anonymous users contributions to Wikipedia.
 
As anonymous users are tracked by IP address, any one real-world user may be broken up into a countless Wikipedia users if they happen to reside behind a dynamic IP.
 
Even given a fairly stable IP address here at home, the Wikipedia user contributions page for my latest anonymous identity only lists 23 edits to my name. Another one from a month or two back lists only 6. My IP address at work seems to switch on an almost hourly basis, so multiple casual edits from even a single day from there may show up as isolated edits by random readers passing in the night.
 
The idea that the bulk of Wikipedias substance comes from the more heavily specialized, non-community users strikes me as inherently reasonable (and actually quite reassuring).
 
I dont think, though, that you can establish with any certainty whether these anonymous users return time after time or if they really just make a handful of changes and never hit edit again.

This is fantastic research and very actionable. Unfortunately, as you note, some actions are going the other way (making it harder for the less frequent but more knowledgeable users).
 
The other major grip I have with Wikipedia recently is the proliferation of citations. I understand why people think they are of value but I feel like a) they lead to another false sense of authority and b) they lead to disjointed articles (ie., Ive seen articles that seem like a long list of citations with not a single sentence seeming to flow from the preious one).

I wrote several wikipedia articles, where I wrote an entire article up out of nothing. In each case, the article was then edited  without any notification to me  by some super-editors, who removed content, and turned what I thought was gosh-darn good writing into crap. I tried to explain to friends my frustrations, and they told me Why do you even bother? Of course its just a bunch of self-important snobs.
 
So I went and looked at the people who edited my contributions, and saw that my friends were right. These people, by and large, edited thousands of articles. In most cases, these edits were to remove material that they found unsuitable. Indeed, some of the people-history pages contained little awards that people gave each other  for removing content from Wikipedia.
 
Since I heard of your article, I headed on to the voting page, and, alas and alack, I am not eligible to vote, since I have only made 21 article edits. I was also informed that since I didnt have the required number of edits by yesterday, I cannot become eligible.
 
HURRAH, I am DISENFRANCHISED.
 
All this leads me to ask, I wonder if those little awards that people give each other count towards the required number of edits?

Perhaps a more useful metric would be: # of letters typed that are still present in the current release. This would weed out those who contribute garbage data that is only removed later. An even more useful but difficult metric to measure would be: # of letters typed that are present in the most recent non-garbage release (as the current version of some pages may be vandalized).

I find it funny that people are complaining its not easy enough to make edits because the big bad super editors revert your writing. Look  wikipedia cant have it both ways, you need to cite your facts, sometimes that means going to the library to cite a fact you already know to be true. Maybe a google book search, a news search, whatever.
 
Has anyone noticed the articles about wikipedia in the news lately? They are all scare tactics  wikipedia is a fraud because anyone can make edits! Thats why the editors have to be so tough about what is added, if they really did allow any old thing to be added wikipedia would be completely useless.
 
So stop complaining, we cant have it both ways. Either we are strict on each other or wikipedia is garbage. Take your pick.

Interesting, but as you comment, the analysis really needs to be expanded beyond a couple articles. Otherwise, you risk generalizing from too small a base.
 
Speaking of which, Ill generalize - or at least talk about - myself. The first big thing I did on Wikipedia was editing the Henry James entry up to featured-article status, plus writing a lot of articles on individual works by James. I did much of this work anonymously because I was often too lazy to log in under my account name.
 
You could say I was your narrow-focus expert user at first, the kind of editor you think contributes most of the real content. But then something funny happened. I gradually turned into one of Jimbos 0.7% users. Now I make lots of edits to various articles on the encyclopedia, and almost none of them have anything to do with Henry James.
 
Yesterday, for instance, I worked on an article called Human Waste Project (dont ask). Yes, I chip in some real content to such articles, but I also do a lot of cleaning up, linking, organizing, citing, etc. As a result, my edit count has started to pile up, and my contributions list has become a hodgepodge of edits on wildly different subjects.
 
So your two types of editors are not always distinct. Sometimes, a narrow-focus expert can turn into an all-purpose janitor. God help me, it happened to my little old self.

To take another example, I recently janitored the article on John Podhoretz. I did a lot of reorganization, straightened out the cites, set up a bibliography, etc.
 
But I also added a lot of content about Podhoretz views on various issues. So its not like janitors dont make content contributions, as well. We shouldnt get carried away with the distinction between the two types of editors. They really do blend into each other sometimes. For instance, theyve blended into, well, me.

Your finding pretty much agree with what Ive found from working on Wikipedia for a year or so.  Im a little surprised that its skewed quite as far as you say - I think most newbies start by fixing small problems - then get the confidence in the process to dump their personal knowledge areas into a couple of articles which they proceed to maintain for a while.
 
Then comes the fork in the road - some get drawn inexorably into the community and make more and more (mostly minor) edits - where others lose interest and go away.
 
But without doubt, it is impossible for 500 people to have made even the smallest scratch into 1.2 million English language articles.  Over the couple of years that Wiki has really taken off, those 500 people would each have had to have written one new article a day in order to have written half of the articles out there.
 
When you consider the increasing amounts of time those people spend arguing about policy, voting on articles to promote and delete and fixing up style/category/spelling/grammar issues too - thats just not credible.

Wikipedia is past the first phase of its growth, when the emphasis was on seeding content.  It has reached sufficient size that parasitic elements start to become noticeable.  The emphasis must now be on cultivating an organization of editors that can properly tend to its growth.  This will require creating a hierarchy of editors and creating a system so that this hierarchy can be properly created and regulated.  For example, an easy complaint mechanism would allow a casual contributor like one of the commenters above to report his problem with an editor wiping out his content to another editor with wider authority, who can adjudicate.  Further, he might be given the ability to create a petition making a case for removing an administrator from control of a particular section.  This petition might be enforced if he can get enough registered users to vote for it.  Those who believe that anything can be done without some sort of administrator hierarchy and easy ways to collect consensus opinions are hoping for a utopian fantasy.  Wikipedia may be a good example of the tragedy of the commons, as most contributors, including me, cannot be bothered to look into the administrator selection process.  However, Wikipedians must always be aware that someone can fork the content and create their own system with its own editing hierarchy (though the costs of bandwidth and servers will ensure that this is not a spontaneous decision).  I suspect that forks to other sites with better administrator processes is what will happen.

No successful forks have happened yet. Fred Bauder, one of the ArbCom members on Wikipedia, tried a fork with Wikinfo, but it never really caught on.
 
Anybody who tries to impose a hierarchy of editors on a Wikipedia fork will find it hard to lure contributors away from more free-wheeling sites, like Wikipedia itself. Thats what happened to Bauder, and I suspect it will happen to anybody attempting a more rigidly policed fork site.

Aaron,
 
Excellent article, and congratulations on your slashdotting.  As per your last article I had gone to wikipedia to vote for you and found out that because I had not made more that 400 edits I couldnt vote.  I was surprised that I didnt meet the criteria as Ive been a member for a long time. I decided I must not be a very good member so I doubled (by doing ten) my number of edits instead of voting.
 
Now reading these points I am all the more motivated to vote for you but have decided that instead of me being a poor wikicitizen wikipedias voting system advances an unfair assumption.  The same assumption that you unearthed here: that the only people that matter are the large quantity editors.
 
So I cant vote for you, but if you do get elected and you do believe what you wrote you should act to change the voting system.
 
-Andy

You seem to have forgotten considering those users with large numbers of edits and who contribute large amounts to articles. There may be those who are not by your definition outsiders. What are the statistics in this instance? This would have made your analysis a little more complete.

Intreguing study, Aaron. From my own personal (& incomplete) experience, I have to agree with your conclusion  either I can focus on lots of little edits that concern style, formatting, & so forth, or I can focus on making a few substantial contributions.
 
Despite having written a number of essays in college, I still find it a challenge to write even 500 words on any given topic for Wikipedia.
 
So why do some contributors cluster at one extreme or the other in their behavior  & some end up becoming entirely involved in another axis of participation, creating & enforcing policy? I sense material for a Masters thesis in psychology or sociology here.

A nice article and thx a lot for the insight!
Anyhow i do have some concerns:
One interesting thing about the wiki-thing in wikipedia is that different tasks (like editing, reviewing, formal qa - to name but a few) are conducted through a single interface and that the complexity of creating an article is therefore driven from the software itself into the flexible organisation of production and publication (so to say, the human factor).
Regarding yours and Jimmy Wales research, i think that both approaches show some flaws in terms of this aspect. 
You both wanted to identify an aspect of quality - Which contributions by whom made up the essence (a hard to operationalize term in anyway) of the article by quantitative means. I dont know if this works at all, but in any case there needs to be some sort of categorization: 
What kind of edit has been conducted here? Editing, Reviewing, Janitoring (?) etc.
Did this edit lead towards the current state of the article or not? The so called quality of an article in wikipedia is not defined by absolute means but is the result of the quality demands of the stakeholders, therefore subject to dynamic change.
In the end this approach is a tedious and time-consuming work if you want to conduct it for thousands of articles.
And also, by the way, not as shiny and reliable as pure quantitative work.

admins start out doing serious contributions, then become janitors.

Very interesting article, and definitely worth reading. I often feel that the Wikipedia community, such as it is, places too much emphasis on users with a large number of edits (i.e., themselves), and doesnt consider what those edits actually are. The current voting system is a perfect example of this. I would be voting for you, Aaron, but apparently I have only 85 edits. What I dont understand is why this makes me less deserving of a say in how Wikipedia is run than someone with more edits.

Im also one of the hybrid users mentioned above. When I first came aboard 2 1/2 years ago, I went crazy adding content on local institutions and issues, plus topics I know about but didnt have significant content.
 
But I only know so much; after a while I was mainly just maintaining what Id contributed and talking about how else to present it, with other editors who were interested. Once in a while Ill have a burst of new knowledge - Ive visited a location or read an article or experienced a unique event - where I can dump a bunch more knowledge. But those are few and far between; 90% of my edits these days are cleanups, formats or comments, of both my work and of existing work that I have interest in and knowledge of.
 
I think many diehards are the same; working to keep things looking good and presentable and encyclopedic to the outside world.
 
I cant speak for the knowledgeable newbie crowd - I dont know them well - but we should keep them in mind when making policy decisions. We try to assume good faith and not bite them, as the policy pages say; how realistically they are followed is another matter. That, we will have to leave for the administrators.
 
Im still considering my vote. Aaron, you may well be on my final list; Ill cosider all the issues when it comes to it.

Interesting article, I agree with your findings that articles are written mostly by anonymous (expert)contributors.
 
Mostly they EXPAND the already existing (small) article. I think article creation is less common among anonymous contributors (this would be interesting to find out as well, or maybe there are already statistics on this??).
 
The value of CATEGORISATION and creating INTERLINKAGES I think should be stressed more in your article, since these improve the encyclopedia and create new insights.
categorisation/interlinking effort are probably more often undertaken by the active community (does statistical data exist?).
 
Another point Id like to make in my concern with DELETION of whole articles on wikipedia by often the active community: after a small week and some votes of this community on a certain article, the article may be voted to be deleted. This is often decided quantitatively, not qualitatively. Often arguments for keeping the article are not debated; or arguments for deletion are not well founded.
Some contributors might be on a wikibreak, come back some time later and find out (or not, even worse) about a deleted article: old deleted pages are (sometimes?) completely inaccessible. 
This is a loss of content that should be avoided since it frustrates contributors and decreases the quality of the encyclopedia for its users.
 
Feedback on these concerns is much appreciated! :)

Contributeur franais rgulier, je peux confirmer que mon activit se partage entre quelques contributions substancielles dans mes domaines de spcialits et des interventions dditeur (forme, corrections, vrifications, critiques) beaucoup plus nombreuses. La loi de Pareto sapplique mais dans le sens 80 % des contributeurs pour le contenu et 20 % pour la forme.
Lintrt de Wikipedia nest pas dans sa ressemblance plus ou moins proche avec les encyclopdies traditionnelles (recueil de linformation, rdaction, validation) qui est invitable, je ne vois pas comment faire autrement !, mais dans le fait que lensemble de ces actions est ouvert  un grand nombre de personnes (potentiellement gigantesque). Car dsormais les effets produits sont des rgularits, des rgulations qui dpassent celles qui taient jusqualors accessibles : le recueil des informations sollicite des dizaines de milliers de personnes et progressivement de plus en plus, ce qui permet de couvrir des domaines qui ntaient jamais couverts par les encyclopdies traditionnelles, limites par les ressources de temps et matrielles. Les corrections-validations par des milliers de lecteurs produisent au fil du temps des articles de qualit acceptable qui ouvrent sur un thme et donne les moyens dlargir la recherche et den faire ventuellement la critique (combien de fois suivant un lien externe  WP, jai pu critiquer une information et en proposer ou faire la correction dans un article ?). Ce processus est cumulatif dans le temps et accrot encore leffet grand nombre : ne pas en tenir compte serait une grave erreur danalyse. Cest dailleurs une erreur que certains expriment en demandant de manire rcurrente des validations par des experts ou des comits restreints : une manire de supprimer leffet grand nombre qui me semble-t-il est la force majeure du processus Wikipedia. Cette force en volution permanente fait peur  certains, manifestement.

Im one of two super editors who have made the bulk of edits on the site; Im now out of content  i have, literally, not much more to add.
I realise now that I should be approaching so-called Subject Matter Experts and getting them to add content, and letting the rest of us tidy it up for them.

Great proactive analysis. Wales statement, prior to his next version, probably shouldnt have been so definite..
 
Last month Jason Calacanis wrote, about the pitfalls of Wikipedias syntax and unintuitive interface. Given your findings and as a candidate for the foundations Board of Directors do you feel a leveling of the learning curve of the content production process should be of priority? After all, if the content producers are empowered to improve their formatting and structure, the Top 2% will have less ground to accumulate edits and thus power.

Ill have to agree with you here. I know that Ive only made a few contributions to Wikipedia, mostly on subjects that I know enough about to make meaningful contributions. So occasionally Ill jump on Wikipedia and make a few edits, usually substantial in content (in accordance with the be bold imperative of Wikipedia).
 
Although it hasnt always happened, largely I find that the pages are monitored by a specific person who end up attempting to erase the edits or substantially change them. Take a look at the Wikipedia page on Jack Thompson, which is basically edited into a hagiography. One of the pages I made a substantial edits to (roughly doubling the length of the article) was then edited back to its initial state by a person with a severe conflict of interest (vice-president of a company who was mentioned in the edits). What it often comes down to is that the people who are compulsively looking out for their own interests, rather than the truth, are willing to dedicate more time on the site squashing what they dont like. Too bad, really.

I wrote an ethnography of a Wikipedia article a bit more than a year ago, looking at the Support Vector Machines article.
 
Though my conclusions did not directly contradict those above, I did not find that the majority of major edits were made by less active users of Wikipedia.  For the Support Vector Machines article, I found that there were two major editors - one of whom was a very active Wikipedia user with an account and second was only known by an IP address but knew the norms of Wikipedia very well, indicating he/she too was an active Wikipedia user.

I think that the regulars play a role that is larger than formatting.  Part of the reason that Wikipedia is not a useless mess is because it is organized.  The same collection of information, poorly organized, would be little better than doing a Google search.  For many people, in many situations, the current Wikipedia is a more useful way to find certain kinds of information than a Google search is.
 
Your observation that there are different types of users is spot on, but I think that all types (except vandals) play an indispensible role.

I have been a original content generator on Wikipedia for some time, but stopped after Ive become disillusioned with the whole site.  I do not see very many users adding original content at all (at least on the articles Ive worked on), other than just the moving, deleting and rewording things here and there.  What we have are the some smuggest, know-it-all editors and admins making snide remarks on the work I have done, but they havent done anything to add anything worthwhile.  But thats my experience.

Most of my contributions have been removed (not modified) and so I have largely stopped contributing.
 
Often times the contributions are removed and not modified with obscure references to numerous wikipedia policies that seem to make no sense and that are enforced very unevenly across the wikipedia.
 
At other times, controversial but accurate information is just removed, resulting in a very bland innocuous mostly harmless article.  (And not terribly useful.)
 
The cyberstalking article is a case in point.  It is humorous (and sad!) to examine how that article has evolved over time.

What annoys me about Wikipedia is the peoples penchant for rewording other peoples stuff. For instance, I wrote original material on Impression Fraud on my site( http://www.sofizar.com/impression-fraud.php ). I was shocked to find that wikipedia entry for impression fraud was a summary of my article with nary a credit. Are the authors of wikipedia just trying to get done with everything?

Lets face it.  Few people want to strain themselves of doing the hard and winded research (such as going through books or scouring through newspapers and academic journals, and so on) and writing.   Its easier just to rephrase someone elses work or use other Web sites as citable sources as accessible through Google.

I wonder if all the people who have had trouble with mean administrators really provided valuable content.

Perhaps Wikipedia simply gives people a certain surge of authoritative and administrative power and prestige over others.  Those with user names feel entitled to a sense of superiority, compared to a user with a mere IP address and a few original entries.

But on the other hand, the more people view an article the more it is likely to be corrected and balanced for NPOV.
 
The more people that view an article the more likely the article is to reflect the views of more people. Sometimes that will tend towards a NPOV and sometimes not. The article will increasingly reflect popular opinion (which may not be neutral at all).
 
it isnt perfect, but in the opinion of many the results are fairly acceptable.
 
Perhaps, but not definitive. How do you justify that claim?
 
When an article can be objective without threatening the views of people it stands a decent chance of being so. Wikipedia is, by its nature, not an objective resource. It is a useful one, though.

I am agree with autors opinion. I think the volunteer authors of Wikipedia articles dont have to be experts, although some certainly are. They could be anyone! Further, volunteers do not need any formal training before creating a new article or editing an existing article. Many people have created or edited articles in Wikipedia. They live in different countries of earth, from all ages and backgrounds. The autors are called a Wikipedian or Wiki. The policy to add to the encyclopedia only statements that are verifiable, and not to add original research. To hold the quality high there are special style guide encourages editors to cite sources.

Very good article Aaron. I had this suspicion for a long time myself. Just couldnt pursue it for various reasons. I am not a particularly big fan of Wikipedia or Jimbo Wales due to their very weird policies of editing. To date I have contributed only one big article and that thankfully survived massive editing. I feel those folks should open up a bit more. It seems way too rigid at the moment. Vandalism is inevitable but the community should grow. Stagnation will not only erode the quality of the site but also lead to its slow and painful death. I hope you read this Jimbo.

Its not the first time in the history of mankind that a Great Thing is taken over by admins who dont understand much of the Initial Idea, but who understand very well how to benefit of it. Hierarchies, structures and rules prevent any further progress and the Great Thing converts into a Serious Thing, that uses the Initial Idea only as a marketing tool.

In response to the criticism made by Carbidfischer, well, if you have something to benefit from Wikipedia Im sure youll defend them.
 
Anyhow, I hope the author of the original article could do some similar analyses on the Wikipedia articles on Chinatown, Asian supermarket, and Little Saigon.  You see, I wrote a bulk of those articles and over the years I have seen many others just delete here, rephrase there, add a link there, make remarks thither but not much else.

It is true that the Editors,or the formatters,are more concerned about the tone,style,category of the wikis.While most part of the world does not find any or even minimum adequate representation,(Even historic monuments and large towns in India do not appear even in the www,what to say of the wikipedia)the concern with formalities does discourage contributions.Contributors do so because they felt something about the topic and the feeling  will certainly come out.All of them,or even a few of them cannot be expected to have the attitude and training of encyclopedia editors.The editors appear to be specialists who know only editing and surely they seem to be knowing nothing else.In India,the office typists have the same attitude.They show all the concern for the format only,not for the content,because they do not realise the relative importance of the content.

You wrote in your article:  Thus his assumption that outsiders contribute mostly vandalism and nonsense. And thus the comments you sometimes hear that making it hard to edit the site might be a good thing.
If  outsiders like me give a different viewpoint you think the same way like Jimbo Wales.

Wow, great article. Im glad to hear your findings, after hearing Wales initial findings. It has far reaching implications in society as a whole, not just Wikipedia. How depressing would that have been, that only some .7% of people were capable of any kind of productive contribution to society, with the rest of us just sitting around bickering about the presentation. Though it may seem like that to those with some kind of deep interest and active role in society, really all they are doing is directing everyone elses major contributions. In spite of their self deception to the contrary, their roles as spit shiners is immensely important, and  not at all petty. If they could get off of their imaginary high horses to see that, then they probably wouldnt need the delusion to keep their self image so well bolstered.

Thanks for the provocative and interesting analysis.  I dont agree that the editors of traditional encyclopedias concern themselves largely with formatting and presentation.  As mediators between the copyeditor and the contributor, their primary objective is to vet content: to assign articles, assure the reader that the contributors have some grounding in an existing literature to establish the authority of their claims, to check facts, and especially to align articles on various subjects with other articles: to remain true to the encyclopedias overarching purpose.  The insider-editing you describe in your article is largely basic copyediting, but it is far, far narrower than traditional encyclopedia editing, and its a significant reason why academics and instructors are wary of Wikipedia as an authoritative source as opposed to a window into the minds and ideas of contributors.

Part 1: Wikimedia at the Crossroads
Part 2: Who Writes Wikipedia?

Part 5: Making More Wikipedias
Part 6: Code, and Other Laws

 
If you translate this essay, please contact me.
 
Vote for me in the election for the Wikimedia Foundations Board of Directors.
 
A couple weeks ago I had the great privilege of attending Wikimania, the international Wikimedia conference. Hundreds from all over the world gathered there to discuss the magic that is Wikipedia, thinking hard about what it means and why it works. It was an amazing intellectual and emotional experience.
 
The main attraction was seeing the vibrant Wikipedia community. There were the hardcore Wikipedians, who spend their days reviewing changes and fixing pages. And there were the elder statesmen, like Larry Lessig and Brewster Kahle, who came to meet the first group and tell them how their work fits into a bigger picture. Spending time with all these people was amazing fun  theyre all incredibly bright, enthusiastic and, most shockingly, completely dedicated to a cause greater than themselves.
 
At most technology conferences Ive been to, the participants generally talk about technology for its own sake. If use ever gets discussed, its only about using it to make vast sums of money. But at Wikimania, the primary concern was doing the most good for the world, with technology as the tool to help us get there. It was an incredible gust of fresh air, one that knocked me off my feet.
 
There was another group attending, however: the people holding up the platform on which this whole community stands. I spent the first few days with the mostly-volunteer crew of hackers who keep the websites up and running. In later days, I talked to the site administrators who exercise the power that the software gives them. And I heard much about the Wikimedia Foundation, the not-for-profit that controls and runs the sites.
 
Much to my surprise, this second group was almost the opposite of the first. With a few notable exceptions, when they were off-stage they talked gossip and details: how do we make the code stop doing this, how do we get people to stop complaining about that, how can we get this other group to like us more. Larger goals or grander visions didnt come up in their private conversations; instead they seemed absorbed by the issues of the present.
 
Of course, they have plenty to be absorbed by. Since January, Wikipedias traffic has more than doubled and this group is beginning to strain under the load. At the technical level, the software development and server systems are both managed by just one person, Brion Vibber, who appears to have his hands more-than-full just keeping everything running. The entire system has been cobbled together as the site has grown, a messy mix of different kinds of computers and code, and keeping it all running sounds like a daily nightmare. As a result, actual software development goes rather slowly, which cannot help but affect the development of the larger project.
 
The small coterie of site administrators, meanwhile, are busy dealing with the ever-increasing stream of complaints from the public. The recent Seigenthaler affair, in which the founding editor of USA Today noisily attacked Wikipedia for containing an grievous error in its article on him, has made people very cautious about how Wikipedia treats living people. (Although to judge just from the traffic numbers, one might think more such affairs might be a good idea) One administrator told me how he spends his time scrubbing Wikipedia clean of unflattering facts about people who call the head office to complain.
 
Finally, the Wikimedia Foundation Board seems to have devolved into inaction and infighting. Just four people have been actually hired by the Foundation, and even they seem unsure of their role in a largely-volunteer community. Little about this group  which, quite literally, controls Wikipedia  is known by the public. Even when they were talking to dedicated Wikipedians at the conference, they put a public face on things, saying little more than dont you folks worry, well straighten everything out.
 
The plain fact is that Wikipedias gotten too big to be run by just a couple of people. One way or another, its going to have to become an organization; the question is what kind. Organizational structures are far from neutral: whose input gets included decides what actions get taken, the positions that get filled decide what things get focused on, the vision at the top sets the path that will be followed.
 
I worry that Wikipedia, as we know it, might not last. That its feisty democracy might ossify into staid bureaucracy, that its innovation might stagnate into conservatism, that its growth might slow to stasis. Were such things to happen, I know I could not just stand by and watch the tragedy. Wikipedia is just too important  both as a resource and as a model  to see fail.
 
That is why, after much consideration, Ive decided to run for a seat on the Wikimedia Foundations Board. Ive been a fairly dedicated Wikipedian since 2003, adding and editing pages whenever I came across them. Ive gone to a handful of Wikipedia meetups and even got my photo on the front page of the Boston Globe as an example Wikipedian. But Ive never gotten particularly involved in Wikipedia politics  Im not an administrator, I dont get involved in policy debates, I hardly even argue on the talk pages. Mostly, I just edit.
 
And, to be honest, I wish I could stay that way. When people at Wikimania suggested I run for a Board seat, I shrugged off the idea. But since then, Ive become increasingly convinced that I should run, if only to bring attention to these issues. Nobody else seems to be seriously discussing this challenge.
 
The election begins today and lasts three weeks. As it rolls on, I plan to regularly publish essays like this one, examining the questions that face Wikipedia in depth. Whether I win or not, I hope we can use this opportunity for a grand discussion about where we should be heading and what we can do to get there. That said, if youre an eligible Wikipedian, I hope that youll please vote for me.

Aaron, somewhere I lost thread of your argument, though I think Ive got the gist.
 
Lets examine the basics:
 
The Board consists of five directors. Since June 2004, two of these seats have been elected.
 
This means that the board will do what the three permanent members want it to do. Thats just a fact.
 
Thus, the two elected members are some sort of advisory helpers. They have no power when in conflict with the others.
 
Now, as far as I can grasp what you are saying (and I may be wrong), I think you believe that since the vision at the top sets the path that will be followed, you can provide a vision which is true to the spirit. But that would have to be done by strength of vision alone, as voting power is not an option per above.
 
If, hypothetically, just for the sake of an interesting discussion, the $4 million of venture capital invested in Wikia generates imperatives that conflict with the vision (remember, VCs want a big payoff), there wouldnt be much you could do against that. I mean, you could argue for your vision, but in such a conflict Id bet on the money every time.
 
But the upside of being pure of heart is that I doubt you could be bought-off with some IPO shares :-).

I think a lot of the way boards operate is by whos in the room and who theyre talking to  what information is presented and what arguments are made. So even if you and whoever else could get outvoted, you know theres communication between the regal three and the grassroots two, and the outsiders know whats going on in the insider room and vice versa.
 
If the insider three were Rupert Murdoch, Hillary Clinton, and Michael Powell Id be less convinced of this but I think whoever these people are, theyre pretty certainly broadly dedicated to the principles Wikimedia was founded on, having worked without hope of financial incentive for years on the project.

I would love to vote for you, but Im not allowed: I have only 155 edits to my name. Why? Because when I have edited articles, which I do from time to time, I take care to proof them before posting, often by using Preview. Now, if I posted stuff before proofing and then fixed it, I would be over 400 by now: my typing isnt anything like perfect, and sometimes I cant remember which way things go in the [thing|thingy] syntax.

Hello
 
I just found out your blog and this collection of essays related to the elections. Fascinating ! Ill read it entirely in and out one more time as I think there is much to learn about it.
 
One sentence caught my attention though.
 
Finally, the Wikimedia Foundation Board seems to have devolved into inaction and infighting. Just four people have been actually hired by the Foundation, and even they seem unsure of their role in a largely-volunteer community.

May I dare ask you whether you took the time to attend the presentation I made ? I am doubting you did. Either you did not, or you understood nothing of what I said. Thats unfortunate. Id like to invite you to listen to the presentation as well as look at the powerpoint. And if you desire so, to talk about it a bit more. But I am absolutely rejecting the validity of the sentence above. Yes, Jimbo does that. I do not. I have never done that. And I took much pain to try to be as open and honest about how things were NOT working and how much help we needed. Thats frankly dishonnest to claim that our little group is just pretending to fix it all. Either you were being dishonnest because you were a candidate to the board, or you are simply confusing Jimbo with the other members of the group. Please, do me the favor of considering us as human individuals with own opinion and abilities and fear and joys, and not simply as Jimbos valets. Thanks

Title: The Smalltalk Question
 
One of the minor puzzles of American life is what question to ask people
at parties and suchly to get to know them.
 
How ya doin? is of course mere formality, only the most troubled
would answer honestly for anything but the positive.
 
What do you do? is somewhat offensive. First, it really means what
occupation do you hold? and thus implies you do little outside your
occupation. Second, it implies that ones occupation is the most salient
fact about them. Third, it rarely leads to further useful inquiry. For
only a handful of occupations, you will be able to say something
somewhat relevant, but even this will no doubt be slightly annoying or
offensive. (Oh yeah, I always thought about studying history.)
 
Where are you from? is even less fruitful.
 
Whats your major? (in the case of college students) turns sour when,
as is tragically all too often the case, students feel no real passion
for their major.
 
What book have you read recently? will cause the majority of Americans
who dont read to flail, while at best only getting an off-the-cuff
garbled summary of a random book.
 
Whats something cool youve learned recently? puts the person on the
spot and inevitably leads to hemming and hawing and then something not
all that cool.
 
I propose instead that one ask What have you been thinking about
lately? First, the question is extremely open-ended. The answer could
be a book, a movie, a relationship, a class, a job, a hobby, etc. Even
better, it will be whichever of these is most interesting at the moment.
Second, it sends the message that thinking, and thinking about thinking,
is a fundamental human activity, and thus encourages it. Third, its
easiest to answer, since by its nature its asking about whats already
on the persons mind. Fourth, its likely to lead to productive dialog,
as you can discuss the topic together and hopefully make progress.
Fifth, the answer is quite likely to be novel. Unlike books and
occupations, peoples thoughts seem to be endlessly varied. Sixth, it
helps capture a persons essence. A job can be forced by circumstance
and parentage, but our thoughts are all our own. I can think of little
better way to quickly gauge what a person is really like.
 
What have you been working on lately? can be seen, in this context, to
be clearly inferior, although similar.
 
So, what have you been thinking about lately?
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

I like the question, but until it comes into common use, it will still be a bit awkward. I think because people dont often hear such open-ended questions from strangers, theyre likely to infer a more specific question and answer that with the same problems you mentioned.
 
Ive been thinking lately about how to encourage diverse self-selected communities without geographic constraints forcing us to spend time around people who annoy us (i.e. online).

I often ask newly-met people whats important to them.  It definitely throws them off at first, but just generally taking an interest in something -they- find interesting gets it going just fine.
 
If what they thing is important is foreign to me, so much the better I can learn something and treat them to a blank slate.
 
Simon Willison probably set a record in meeting people at SXSW a while back by asking everyone he met what they were excited about.  By the time the conference was over, it seemed everybody knew him.

I like Aarons question, and am often trying to figure out what type of open-ended question to ask people in these situations. Especially nerds, who are often the most interesting once they get rolling, but often slow to start talking to new people (myself included).

Im not sure I agree with this - I was recently at a party where I didnt know many of the guests, and this was used as the standard icebreaker by myself and others, and each time it led to interesting conversations. I think this is down to it being such a standard gambit that people always add something to their reply, so instead of Im a journalist or Im an artist, you get Im a news journalist, Im just back from the Lebanon or Im an artist, Im hanging my new show tomorrow.
 
That said, I do like the suggested question and will try it out, even if it would probably be met with a raised eyebrow.
 
Ive been thinking about the (apparent) lack of contemporary equivalents to movements like Arts & Crafts, in which people worked collaboratively across different artistic disciplines.

Inquiring so directly about ones occupation seems to be largely a phenomenon of the US.  Most other cultures try to gleen the information from you, or ask other questions before asking such a personal question.
 
I like your suggestion, but I wonder how well it would go over in most social situations.  While I am all for making people think, the icebreaker shouldnt be the time for an unexpected question.  Most people would fumble with the notion, and youd be off to an awkward start 9 times out of 10.  Uncomfortable is not the first impression I generally try to make.

I thought the chapter entitled Relationships in Scott Adams Gods Debris: A Thought Experiment had a good explanation about small talk (two words, which distinguishes it from the programming language).  Gods Debris is even available on Adams site for free as a pdf download.

I also prefer the variation what have you been interested in lately?. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. But - having been given limited actor skills - its one of those questions I can almost always pose with an honest smile.
 
And talking of honest facial expressions when fronted with the question How ya doin? I usually tend to answer honestly, unless theres a really good reason not to. This probably has something to do with my national (Finnish) heritage, and not really understanding the finesses of small talk.
 
Lately, during the past 10 minutes, Ive been thinking that there are probably people who dont consider themselves thinkers. Thus, Ive been thinking that the question Aaron suggests would be of best use in thinkers parties, which he no doubt already visits frequently.
 
Also, for some odd reason, Im currently interested in finding out what the other readers of this blog have lately been interested in.

Im with Tommi; I answer honestly, though not immediately in great detail.  At least, I dont say fine if Im not, and I will mostly say fantastic if I am.  I figure if youre going to ask the question.
 
I also find your preferred question to be a little awkward to say.  If Whats on your mind? didnt have such a negative connotation to me Id probably lean towards it, instead.
 
I find this notion:
Fourth, its likely to lead to productive dialog, as you can discuss the topic together and hopefully make progress.
interesting because it seems to bespeak a singularly male perspective.  Dismissing the vapidity of the Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus meme, I find that the ideas behind that book ring true in my relationships - men often see language/conversation as a tool for problem solving and women as a means of connection.

I tend to stick with what got us together in the first place. Relationships are based on shared experiance and ideology so I try and home in on that. We are both at this event for a reason so I start with that: 
what did you you think about the presentation? or
 
How do you know the groom? or
 
Do you teach here?
 
Somthing like that. I guess it is like the what do you do question but it is relevent. Its more like a friendly what are you doing?  It makes it likely the responce will be somthing we are both interested in and can continue to talk about.

It seems obvious that the increase in page views is related to people discovering Wikipedia after the Seigenthaler op-ed, especially since the date appears to be a trigger. But it was not the first time that Wikipedia was getting a wide-audience media coverage. So the question is: Why didnt the number of page views increase in such a dramatic way before? Why was this particular event such a trigger?
 
Was it the lack of controversy in previous reports that failed to catch the publics curiosity? Did the received publicity reach a wider audience than any previous article? Did people feel threatened by Wikipedia, fearing anyone could create an iniquitous article about their very person? Did a more global debate (such as the regulation of the Internet) play a role?
 
The incident clearly contributed to the explosion of visitors, but it came to my attention that the date also roughly coincides with Wikipedia getting prominent ranks in Google searches - usually one of the first five results on a given topic. Can anyone confirm?

Title: Solidarity for the Shy: Achieving Critical Mass
 
The idea is simple: once a month, people meet up in the center of the
city with their bikes and then go on a ride through the city together,
taking over the streets through sheer numbers. Theres little explicit
politics  with the exception of a distaste for car culture  and no
leaders or official organizers. The whole thing, the (unofficial)
website explains, is a xerocracy: pass out xeroxes of your proposal
and maybe people will follow it. Sounds like fun.
 
I finally got myself together enough to go this month and, half an hour
before starting time, hopped on my bike and headed over. Unfortunately I
didnt look at the directions all that carefully and ended up getting
lost in Boston. At one point I made a wrong turn and found myself
trapped in the middle of a major highway, facing the wrong direction,
and with little opportunity to make it to the side. Somehow, though, I
managed to escape.
 
I got lost several more times and became increasingly frustrated with
Bostons loopy street plan. Forget about being bike-friendly, this city
isnt even car-friendly. As I repeatedly reversed my path, I figured I
had no doubt missed the event. Just as well, I figured, since my leg
muscles were aching from a heavy day of running yesterday and the sky
was so cloudy that rain seemed inevitable. Still, I figured, I should at
least try to find the location of the meetup for next time.
 
I made sure to bring nothing with me save the key to my apartment (both
for aerodynamism and in case I got arrested  in New York, the police
have been known to harass and arrest CMers for parading without a
permit) so I dont know what time I arrived, but I do know how my face
lit up when I saw the mass of bicycles and cyclists arranged at the
park, even as the wind was trying to blow me over.
 
The park was a small right triangle,taking up less than half the block.
On one side was a farmers market, closing up shop for the day. On the
other was a small protest about Israels invasion of Lebanon, with many
waving Lebanese flags and a speaker on a podium (whose voice was
amplified by portable radios his associates carried around the crowd)
discussed the tragedy of the invasion. A fat balding man waved a sign
reading Moderate Muslims: Help US Fight Islamonazism, but things were
otherwise quite civil.
 
Finally, on the hypotenuse, were the cyclists, just standing and
chatting. By the time Id made my way over to them, I noticed they were
biking around in a circle together, so I joined in, smiling at the
sight. We all biked around for a while until someone shouted Mike, go
right! Mike did, exiting onto the street, and the crowd followed.
 
For the most part, I tried to stay in the middle of the pack. Bikes rode
on all sides of me, while cars were stopped in their tracks. Frustrated,
many of them pounded on their horns. In response, the crowd imitated
their honk, except shouting woohoo as the noise, as if the cars were
cheering them on.
 
We were particularly amused at the sight of a duck tour stopped in its
tracks. I didnt catch what happened next, but from what I heard, the
duck tour tried to break into the mass and ended up running right into
the car next to it, greatly amusing all the massers.
 
Before we started, I overheard someone discussing about how last time a
car tried to break into the mass as it was passing by. He said this no
so much in anger but rather in amazement at the audacity of the idea. If
the mass had any opinions, it definitely felt that the street was
rightly its.
 
To protect against future such incursions, a couple people with long
bikes stood in front of cars at intersections, acting as human
barricades, then sprinting back to the front of the mass so they could
do it again. At one intersection, they even tried to placate the cars.
Oh, dont worry, we just be a second, just hold on one sec, they
shouted too the cars, which the mass found hilarious.
 
It was probably just as well the cars stayed put. Once one managed to
break into it the mass, but quickly found itself stymied, like a
bewildered bear suddenly finding itself in the middle of a swarm of
honeybees.
 
When cars asked what we were all doing, we responded that wed simply
decided to go out for a bike ride. When pedestrians asked, however, we
shouted Critical Mass! Still, despite our vehiclism, some cars did
explicitly shout their support for Critical Mass.
 
Throughout Ive been referring to the mass as a single entity, but it
didnt really feel like one. While there certainly were a lot of bikes,
and together we formed quite an imposing swarm, but despite engaging it
a coordinated activity, we related mostly as individuals, most people
just talking to the friends theyd come with. For the most part, there
just wasnt much to talk about. I was riding my weirdo bike, so a lot of
people said something like sweet bike, but the conversation didnt go
far beyond did you build it? Bikes were, perhaps, the only thing we
had in common. And even casual smalltalk seems exceedingly awkward in
such a situation. American education, it has been said, is about
learning how to be alone in a crowd. Perhaps its not surprising then
that it also teaches how to be alone at a mass protest.
 
The group, however, did make some attempt at community. When some began
falling behind, theyd shout mass up! encouraging the others to slow
down and catch up with the group. But this was more an issue of
practicality than community, though, as a dispersed mass had less
effect.
 
We winded around the city of Boston for a while. Cambridge is some
complex and entertaining, and Im such a loner and stay-insider, that I
rarely find myself across the river in Boston. Thats probably a shame,
because from what I see of it, the citys quite nice. I suppose I must
have been in the North End, which I gather is the nice neighborhood, but
I didnt realize how much so. The streets turned into long promenades
upon which men in dashing suits would dash and attractive women walked
their dogs. The houses were intricate constructions of brick and, from
the outside at least, appeared exceedingly elegant. The whole scene
reminded me of the expensive parts of Manhattan. A fancy shopping
district was just blocks away.
 
After touring this part of the city, with so many twists and turns that
I completely lost track of where we were, we turned up at the bridge to
MIT. Storm clouds provided a backdrop to the horizon and as we crossed
we saw bolt of lightning come down from the clouds and connect with some
tall building. I wasnt thrilled about getting my bike wet, but I
figured that as long as we were heading in the direction of my
apartment, I might as well continue on.
 
We rode up Mass Ave, Cambridges main street, past a noticeably
friendlier crowd of passersby. By the time wed gotten half-way to Harvard Square though, the rain started coming down, very quickly accelerating to full sheets and then to buckets. The wind was blowing so hard that the rain drops attacked my face like darts, making my eyes sting. Even when I put my hand above my eyes for protection, they managed to work their way around it and straight into my eyeballs. In short order, I quickly became soaked through and through. It was a good thing I brought nothing save those keys.
 
The massers, for the most part, embraced the rain, throwing their hands in the air and cheering. And, since I had nothing to worry about getting wet (except the bike, which had already been left out in the rain one too many times), I did the same. It was liberating.
 
As we passed Harvard Square, the rain started pouring down even harder, flooding the streets with water in which our bikes left beautiful trails. We headed into a tunnel, screaming the entire length. Then we stopped at the firehouse at the end, waiting for the rest to catch up, until someone shouted lets go again! and we headed back into the tunnel in the other direction, again screaming. It was this point that we began to turn around and head back to Boston, though by a circuitous route Id never seen before and didnt quite understand. As we turned away from my apartment, I thought about taking this chance to make my exit and head home, but somehow riding home alone seemed more dangerous that continuing on inside the protective bubble of the mass. So I continued. The rain quickly died down, to the annoyance of some riders. Thats all you got? one shouted. Come on!
 
By the time we got back to the bridge to Boston, I was feeling kind of tired and couldnt quite force myself to make it all the way up and, in any event, wasnt quite sure whether I should continue on with everyone. The group had thinned significantly by this point, with people presumably peeling off as we passed their houses. I decided to save the full tour for another time and turned around to head back home.
 
Despite being physically tired and thoroughly soaked, I was exhilarated. It was the most fun Id ever had on a bicycle, despite its oddities and flaws. I couldnt wait to tell my friends.
 
As I rode home, I apparently committed some traffic error, leading some jerk in a car to shout Get the fuck off the road, you ass! It didnt faze me at all, though. Get the fuck off my road, I thought.

Oy vey. Well, thanks for confirming my preconception.  Ive been well aware of the Self-Righteous Biker type since I worked as a messenger in NYC many years ago, and Critical Mass always seemed like a particularly infantile expression of that impulse. How about trying this event instead? I guarantee itll rock your socks off.
 
FYI: The North End is an old Italian neighborhood full of tiny streets and alleys.  The elegant neighborhood with the promenade sounds like Comm. Ave in the Back Bay, which is right next to Newbury Street for shopping and cafe-hopping.  You should get out more, man!

So, you were intentionally causing traffic jams? Because its your street? Im no fan of car culture myself, but how can you justify disrupting and inconveniencing people like that? Suppose a bunch of drivers decided to make life harder for those contemptible pedestrians by driving on the sidewalk one day. What makes you think you have the right to do this? Car owners can live their lives the same as anyone else.

It doesnt sound like you were just using the street. It kinda sounds like you were intentionally using the street in such a way as to block traffic. Its possible to go about your business with a bicycle without requiring a human shield  even in Boston. So I want to know how you can justify using the street in such a way as to disrupt people, when you could have done it without disrupting them, for your own entertainment. I mean, do you also throw pies in peoples faces?

Every day is a Critical Mass for cars. A group ride once a month is a minor interruption to give cyclists a safe space to celebrate their chosen means of transport.

Ken says: Car drivers tend to be careless with their deadly vehicles. I find just the opposite. I encounter rude behavior and get cut off when riding in the city, but encounter few truly careless motorists. However, I constantly see bikers driving recklessly, swerving in and out of traffic, and not even slowing down when making a right turn. Bikers often complain about how people drive their cars secure in the knowledge that theyre protected by pounds of steel, as one asinine letter to the Globe put it. But theres a flipside to that:  many bikers drive as if theyre well aware they can do little damage to others through their own carelessness. That trend is even more apparent in pedestrians.

Title: Simple Tips for Longer Living
 
Understanding the human body and foods effects on it over long periods of time is hard. Counting, by contrast, is easy. This, at least, is the premise behind the Nurses Health Study, a multi-decade project by Harvard to gather empirical information about nutrition. The idea behind the study is simple: collect a reasonably large group of people all in a rather similar situation (nurses) and have them fill out a yearly survey with two questions: what did you eat? and are you dead yet? Theyve been doing this since 1976.
 
Then you simply punch the information into a computer and figure out what foods kill people. The results, as described in the associated book Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy provide some simple tips for living longer.
 
Replace white bread with whole wheat. White bread is simply whole wheat bread shorn of all its nutritional value. Whole wheat has more nutrients, more protein, etc. Plus, white bread is metabolized quickly by your body so it leads to huge spikes in blood sugar which have unhealthy effects on your body and make you hungry after you crash; whole wheat bread is digested more evenly.
 
Replace burgers with chicken. Dark meat when grilled can lead to potential carcinogens, whereas white meat is overall healthier. Chicken contains less saturated (bad) fat while dark meat may give you too much iron.
 
Replace soft drinks with water. These results are from the same study but werent featured in the book. Drinking a soda makes you 85% more likely to develop diabetes and can cause you to gain up to ten pounds. Its probably that high amounts of sugar in the bloodstream put an increased demand for insulin on the pancreas, the studys author explains.
 
Im about the fussiest eater I know and even I can handle these changes. Whole wheat bread even tastes better than white.

Chicken is healthier mostly because it has less fat - burgers are pretty high in fat, and also in added sugar. But lean red meat can also be healthy in moderation.
 
To answer Duck, soda without sugar doesnt directly lead to diabetes. But my experience is that it reinforces the desire for sweetness in general.

Dark meat when grilled can lead to potential carcinogens. Huh?  Grilling any food leads to carcinogens, so I dont know what that statement means. Cooking processes in general introduce far more carcinogens into your diet than pesticides and artificial additives ever will.

Bit late, but just found last week, somewhere in the Wall St Journal, that now researchers are finding without oil/fat/grease (not a lot) our digestive organs wont absorb any of key nutrients from veges and fruits.
 
Back in my original country, it is known that boiled carrot or raw carrot is useless thing to eat: You got to add some oil or fat to it and cook minimumly (stir-fry is best and boil is next) - raw carrot eating is a stupid modern thing to do. Might look healthy, but you are not getting key nutient such as carotene in. Without getting that melted? out into oil, your body wont  be able to absorb it at all. (That goes with, I suspect, some Herbal/Chinese medicine stuff too. They say take this bitter Chinese boiled herbs tea after the meal. But what if the patients are really cuting fat and grease off from their diets? - under the influence of some, say American diet fad. )
 
So now Western?/American researchers are coming to see the vailidy of this common knowledge.
 
And this hits a question. Why humans got to eat so much kind of food, usually processed somehow together? Why we evolved out to be this way? We got a digestive system which requires oil and heat to be added to even veges or fruits. How this requiring character of our body - can be explained from the perspective of evolution theory?
 
I wish we already had a website like that.

Title: What is going on here?
 
In his 1959 classic, The Sociological Imagination, the great sociologist C. Wright Mills told students of the discipline:
 
As a social scientist, you have to  capture what you experience and sort it out; only in this way can you hope to use it to guide and test your reflection, and in the process shape yourself as an intellectual craftsman. But how can you do this? One answer is: you must set up a blog
 
In such a blog  there is joined personal experience and professional activities, studies under way and studies planned. In this blog, you  will try to get together what you are doing intellectually and what you are experiencing as a person. here you will not be afraid to use your experience and relate it directly to various work in progress. By serving as a check on repetitious work, your blog also enables you to conserve your energy. It also encourages you to capture fringe-thoughts: various ideas which may be byproducts of everyday life, snatches of conversation overheard in the street, or, for that matter, dreams. Once noted, these may lead to more systematic thinking, as well as lend intellectual relevance to more directed experience.
 
The blog also helps you build up the habit of writing.  In developing the blog, you can experiment as a writer and this, as they say, develop your powers of expression.
 
Actually, he called it a file instead of a blog, but the point remains the same: becoming a scientific thinker requires practice and writing is a powerful aid to reflection.
 
So thats what this blog is. I write here about thoughts I have, things Im working on, stuff Ive read, experiences Ive had, and so on. Whenever a thought crystalizes in my head, I type it up and post it here. I dont read over it, I dont show it to anyone, and I dont edit it  I just post it.
 
I dont consider this writing, I consider this thinking. I like sharing my thoughts and I like hearing yours and I like practicing expressing ideas, but fundamentally this blog is not for you, its for me. I hope that you enjoy it anyway.

Title: Nutrition Basics
 
As part of changing my eating habits, Ive become quite interested on the subject of nutrition. I cant seem to find a good guide to the subject online, so in the spirit of flailing in public until someone comes to my aid, I thought Id write up what I think I know. Feel free to correct me or point me to better sources in the comments.
 
Calories are the basis of eating; theyre a measure of the amount of energy a food provides. Your body gets calories from the food you eat and spends them to keep you moving. If you get more calories than you spend, your body stores the excess as fat. If you spend more than you get, your body burns some of the fat its stored up (for just such an occasion).
 
Thus the standard advice for losing weight: eat less, exercise more. Eating less brings fewer calories in, while exercising more uses up more of them. Unfortunately, both of these things are quite hard to achieve, because the body seems to regulate them through the use of set points: your body keeps track of how much fat you have through a chemical called leptin and makes you hungry if youre starting to lose weight. Thus, if you skip a meal in the morning, itll be sure to make you extra hungry in the evening, so that your overall weight doesnt change.
 
A similar setpoint seems to operate for exercise. In one experiment, doctors measured how much children moved around with pedometers. Then they tried forcing the children to exercise by giving them a PE class. They found that when kids were forced to exercise at school, they exercised less at home, and ended up doing the same amount of exercise overall. So just as your body seems to make you hungry when youre losing weight and full when youre gaining it, it seems to make you tired when youve burned too many calories and antsy when you havent burned enough.
 
Of course, were not total slaves to such motivations  we can force ourselves when to eat when full or not to eat when hungry, to exercise when tired or to stay still when antsy  but its worth keeping in mind what were up against.
 
Fats have gotten a bad rap, most likely because they share a name with body fat but also, some argue, because they seem lower-class. In truth, however, theyre largely just one way to get calories, and a calorie is a calorie no matter where it comes from.
 
Fats also have effects on cholesterol, a key building block for your bodys cells. There are two types of cholesterol  known informally as good and bad cholesterol. Good cholesterol consists of tightly-packed proteins of cholesterol in your blood stream, allowing cholesterol to be efficiently transported where it needs to go. Bad cholesterol is less densely packed and its cholesterol ends up sticking in the walls of arteries, clogging them and leading to heart disease. Fats have varying effects on cholesterol. Saturated fats should be avoided: they increase levels of bad cholesterol (although they also increase good cholesterol). Unsaturated fats, however, whether monounsaturated or polyunsaturated, are good: they lower bad cholesterol and raising good cholesterol. Trans fats are just the reverse: they increase bad cholesterol levels and decrease good ones; its recommended they be avoided as much as possible.
 
Often nutrition labels only break out unsaturated fats and trans fats; you have to calculate the amount of saturated fat by subtracting these from the amount of total fat. The goal, remember, is to avoid trans fats whenever possible, avoid saturated fats, and go for unsaturated fats.
 
Carbohydrates are another source of calories, the kind found in white wheat products, like bread and pasta. Sugars are a form of carbohydrate and, in fact, the body breaks down other carbohydrates into simple sugars. The problem with sugars is that they go directly into the bloodstream, spiking your blood sugar level. This in itself is unhealthy, but its even worse when the level inevitably crashes and you begin to feel hungry again and eat even more.
 
The exception is with fiber, which the body cant break down. Foods made from whole wheat are high in fiber, so your body takes longer to digest them and the sugar intake is spread out over a longer period of time. Thus while carbohydrates might generally be avoided, whole wheat products (along with fruits and vegetables), include additional nutrients as well as having a safe impact on blood sugar, and are the foundation of a healthy diet.
 
Protein is a similar essential nutrient, allowing the body to make essential components of muscle and hair and so on. If you dont get enough (about 9 grams of protein for every 20 pounds), the body begins breaking down its tissues. (Eating far too much protein, however, as people in low-carb diets do, can be unhealthy as it absorbs calcium from your bones.) While protein can be found in animal products, whole wheat bread is a also an excellent source  a single slice contains five grams of protein. Unfortunately, the proteins found in grains and vegetables are incomplete, so you either need to get some (complete) animal protein or eat a variety of them.
 
Calcium is necessary for building bones and teeth, maintaining the hearts rhythmym, and more. Deficiency can lead to weakened bones and fractures. While dairy products contain significant amounts of calcium, they also contain a lot of saturated fat and has been linked to some cancers. Many other foods are fortified with calcium and some vegetables (kale and collard greens, dried beans, and legumes) are also a good source.
 
Vitamins do all sorts of good things, as well as warding off diseases like scurvy and rickets. Theyre often added to juices and cereals and can be taken by themselves in a daily multivitamin as well.

Get Understanding Nutrition by Ellie Whitney. Our class used the 10th edition last year. It is written mainly for undergrads but has a lot of good information and provides a good framework for further study. If you want to dig deeper into the biochemistry, get Lehningers Biochemistry. The 4th Edition is current and Lehninger is the gold standard among biochemistry texts. A medical students physiology text would also be useful. Many of the excruciating details (embryology of various recently discovered cell lines, etc) are becoming available on Wikipedia. If you really want to chew on the primary sources, PubMed is the place to go. If you get down to DC, collect your favorite PubMed citations and go to the National Library of Medicine. Its a trip.

Another reason fats have gotten a bad rap is that gram for gram they have twice as many calories as carbohydrates and proteins.
 
But it also stimulates the release of cholecystokinin, which helps you feel full, and slows the absorption of sugars. Both of these effects help you eat less in the long run.
 
So unless youre a portion-size Nazi, eating low-fat junk food is no better, and likely worse, than eating the full-fat variety.

If certain nutrients arent received by your body, over time parts of you should break down and undergo more wear and tear, I would imagine. The best way to get the right nutrients is to identify the foods which are optimally healthy, and eat a variety of them (Im thinking raw fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and nuts/beans). Once youve eaten a variety of foods for a while, I think your body will learn and will start to crave the foods that it really needs most on a particular day or week. Depriving the body of enough of any type of healthy food will lead to nutritional deficiency, some as yet unknown.
 
As far as what foods are optimally nutritious, I dont know of where to find an actual list. You definitely cant get enough nutrition from a bottle of vitamins. Vitamins reflect only what the current state of nutritional science knows to be good for you, and on top of that, the chemicals in vitamins are no longer in their natural state and are probably not complete. Even just refrigerating your fruit will make it lose some of its nutrients. Imagine putting it into a dry capsule!
 
Weve come a long ways since the days when a nutrition label would tell you if something was good for you. There are so many nutrients it boggles the mind. Read the Wikipedia entry on Nutrition. Besides the usual vitamins and minerals, the body also needs amino acids, fatty acids, and phytochemicals. Worse yet, there are thousands of phytochemicals. Some are antioxidants, which help your cardiovascular and immune systems.
 
My point is its impossible to quantify exactly what nutrients your body needs, and then to try to take all of them with a vitamin. We cant and we dont know everything about how our body functions. So the best you can do is pay special attention to eating the foods which have the most known nutrition (e.g. colored vegetables, berries, whole grains, etc.) and optimize your intake of those. If history is any guide, the best nutritional discoveries will continue to take place in those types of foods.
 
A further take on this is to research what humans have evolved to eat. Before farming arrived and screwed up our diet, humans probably had to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, proteins, and carbohydrates just out of necessity of survival. I dont know much about this, but thats one factor in considering whether eating meat is good for you or not. Our bodies may have evolved to expect that sort of nutrition. (But maybe not humans may not have been big meat eaters originally!) We certainly didnt evolve to eat large amounts of processed grains from industrial farming, and I think drinking milk is also not a natural thing for adults to do, and part of its purported health benefits come from the large US Dairy Association lobby. In fact, a lot of our governmental nutritional information (e.g. nutrition labels) is shaped by the sectors of the economy which have the most power over government. There, I even fit in a Chomsky-like take on your nutrition discussion!

More clarification than correction, but while many vitamins & minerals are essential nutrients, they yield no calories, unlike protein, carbs, & fats.  The mechanisms by which various vitamins operate and the benefits they provide the body are unrelated.  Fiber, too, is part of a healthy diet, but by definition is not nutritious. (While this may seem obvious, youd be surprised the sorts of things people believe.)  Also, protein can be used to build tissue or burned as fuel; carbs & fats can only be burned. And the text leaves the false impression that carbs are intimately associated with wheat products.
 
Not as clear on this point, but there was much talk of the need to complement proteins when vegetarian diets initially became popular, e.g., by pairing milk with peanut butter.  I believe thats no longer considered nearly as important as it once was, since supposedly your body can break down and repurpose the component amino acids to an extent.
 
It is unfortunate that the fat you eat uses the same word as your body fat, since among other problems it leaves the impression that you cant get fat from eating carbs.

Essential aminos and essential fatty acids are essential because the body requires them and cant produce them.  In this sense, vitamins and many minerals and phytochemicals are also essential,  but in such small amounts or over relatively long time periods so that its hard to know exactly whats needed.  Theres also a huge individual variability in what a person needs to build cells and the enzymes critical to staying alive. (see  Roger Williams or Jeffrey Bland.)
 
As Mike notes, the idea of complete  proteins (having a full complement of essential aminos) within a meal is no longer believed. But there is in only limited  repurposing of components and you do need to get all of the essentials over time.
 
The general impact of all this is that it is wise to get your nutrition from a wide variety of food sources.  And , for Aaron, that still applies even though he is eating relatively little.
 
One side issue:  there are no essential carbohydrates.  In other words, the body can any carbohydrate that it needs from protein.  So from a nutrition standpoint, carbs are most importantly a package for essential micro-nutrients (and the fiber for effective elimination)  that the body does require.

To add to the carbs discussion, its not entirely clear from your wording that while sugars go immediately into your bloodstream, carbs are not immediately broken down into sugars, so carbs are better than raw sugar because it gives your body more time to catch up.
 
Your body breaks down the sugars in your bloodstream with insulin, which is released as-needed (unless youre diabetic). But it takes a while for your body to release enough insulin to break down a sudden influx of carbs, which is why high fructose corn syrup is so unhealthy - its just pure, high-density sugar, which our bodies arent prepared to consume.
 
Unfortunately, high fructose corn syrup is used in more and more foods where youd never expect it, turning otherwise healthy foods into the nutrition equivalent of candy.

Understanding nutrition is an endless journey.
 
The human body is a very complicated system, and very little is known of how nutrition affects it. You will notice this when you delve deeper into the studies and find they constantly contradict each other. Always try to get both sides of the story.
 
Many of the guidelines set by the government are based on old studies. It is very difficult for an authoritative institute to admit its mistakes and change course. The guidelines are also based on averages. You, as an individual, might not fit these averages, so keep a food log, even for a few days. This will teach you about your eating habits. Calculate your macronutrient intake.
 
The calorie is a calorie thing is also under debate. You might want to google metabolic advantage.
 
I wouldnt advise avoiding saturated fats completely: 
http://www.westonaprice.org/knowyourfats/skinny.html#benefits
 
The Weston A. Price Foundation is a comprehensive source of unconventional nutrition information. Just remember that this also is just one side of the story.
 
Keep things very, very simple. Avoid extremities and hard rules. To eat healthy is to eat consciously, in a Zen like state where you see not only what you eat but also how you eat.

A calorie is a calorie is a misleading statement.
 
Sure, its true from a thermodynamic standpoint - once you factor in any conversion costs - but its not true from a trying to lose weight perspective. Some calories are much more damaging than others.
 
The key factor is the effect that calories have on blood sugar. This is measured using the glycemic index, a useful but often misused measure of how fast a food is absorbed.
 
Its misused because it discounts calorie density (carrots have a high GI but low calorie density, so that dont have a huge effect on blood sugar), and it also discounts that high GI foods are absorbed less quickly when eaten with other foods.
 
The common feeling that chinese food doesnt fill you up is due to the white rice that you eat with it. High GI -> blood sugar spike -> blood sugar drop -> hunger.
 
The other big area that you didnt explicitly mention is fiber. Fiber both helps slow digestion and fills you up, both of which are hugely useful.
 
I think Shangri La is a bizzare diet, but Im not big on any diet, because that implies a short-term approach to a long-term problem - eathing healthily.

Title: I Love the University
 
I went to visit a friend today at MIT. The past few days Id been
reading more stuff from academia and just that morning I was reading
responses to my old posts at Stanford, so academias siren song had been
on my mind. But getting off the subway at MIT, with me full of energy
after a morning jog, the sun shining brightly down, I couldnt help but
feel like I was missing something, seeing smiles on the faces of the
young geniuses who were everywhere around me.
 
Perhaps its natural, when doing something so greedy and practical as a
startup, to pine for the idealized world of academia. Its image as a
place in an idyllic location filled with smart people has always been
attractive; even more so with the sense that by being there one can get
smarter simply through osmosis. People describe a place of continual
geekiness, of throwing chemicals into the river and building robots in
free time. A magical place for hackers to just enjoy themselves.
 
Its not that I dont enjoy my work; its just that I feel like Im
getting dumber doing it. Or, at least, that Im not getting as smart as
I should.
 
This academaphilia isnt new. Its clearly what drove magazines like
Lingua Franca and makes saying obscure names and words so impressive.
But for some reason it feels stronger now. Ive started downloading
class syllabuses off the Web and doing the reading assignments at night;
Ive started thinking about how to sneak into courses and hang out with
academics. In Cambridge, this paradise seems so close, so acessible.
 
And yet, its hardly paradise at all. When I was actually there I was
turned off by the conformism, the lack of interest in real work, the
politics, the pointless assignments. My lunch date is a grad student and
he tells me of the internecine squabbles, the overspecialization, the
abandonment, the insecurity.
 
I go back to the W3Cs offices and stand at the balcony. Down below, Tim
Berners-Lee discusses details of a project with a group of kids who
presumably took this on as summer job. I was once one of those kids,
working there, and I think about why I left and why I miss it. I marvel
at the pointlessness, the impracticality, the waste.
 
The sky is overcast now, the crowds of students have thinned out, and
those that remain scurry from place to place with their heads down. Im
tired now, I feel sadder, and I wonder how I lost so much so quickly.
 
I want to feel nostalgic, I want to feel like theres this place, just a
couple subway stops away, where everything will be alright. A better
place, a place I should be in, a place I can go back to. But even just
visiting it, the facts are plain. It doesnt exist, it never has. Im
nostalgic for a place that never existed.

Im nostalgic for a place that never existed.
 
Me too.
 
I looked forward to college for most of my pre-college years as a place where I would be around a bunch of other people who really wanted to learn new things.
 
In the end I had built up the idea so well, that I couldnt help but be disappointed with the reality of the institution I ended up at.
 
Oh well :-\

I think you find yourself doing reading assignments at night simply because you can, and not because you have to.
 
Discovering things on your own, without being pushed into it, is so much nicer. Youve got there yourself, and theres a certain sweetness to it.
 
I wonder how many get bored when made to read the standard books issued in high school, only to return to them years later and really enjoy them, simply because no-ones making them read one chapter a night?

If you take my advice Dont waste your best years in doing something so trivial, so yet-another-thing, so doable! Once you step out of school, you virtually spiral in to life long servitude or continuous struggle for survival of enterprise. And trust me, this servitude and war quickly becomes adictive and unescapable before you know it. Listen to Guy kawasaki (http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/hindsights.html).

Pointlessness, impracticality, waste, those words are the opposite of MIT.  Immaturity, innocence, naivety perhaps describe those kids better.  About 20 years ago, Playboy named MIT one of the top 25 party schools in the nation.
In late July, you dont see many parties and drunken MIT students.
 
In any case, the essence of an university is to foster the exchange of ideas, especially imaginative new ideas.  When you have a family to feed, you dont have time to imagine.

My preferred definition of nostalgia for a long time has been Fernando Savaters: Nostalgia is to search oneself where one is no more: and to be painfully surprised of such absence. Yours is a slightly different kind, the particular instance of which (academ-algia) I deeply share, its searching oneself somewhere that never existed: and being painfully surprised of such absence.
 
Personally, my favorite scholarly mirage is Tarnover, the government school for gifted youngsters described in John Brunners Shockwave Rider.

Title: On Losing Weight
 
Exactly three months ago, I wrote about the Shangri-La Diet. While I started on it basically immediately, it wasnt until exactly two months ago that I got a scale to measure my weight with (so some data has been lost). Since I got the scale, however, Ive lost over twenty pounds.
 
Shockingly, losing weight has to be one of the easiest things Ive ever done. I simply dont eat unless Im really hungry and then I eat as little as possible (a couple crackers, for example). Most days I just have a couple crackers in the evening. It saves time and money and hassle (and makes it easy to eat healthy) and while I do get some weird looks from friends at restaurants, always being a fussy eater thats nothing new. (Furthermore, theres some evidence that not eating significantly prolongs lifespan.)
 
The one thing that really did surprise me is that while I predicted there would be strong social pressures to lose weight, in reality all the pressure seemed to go the other way. Friends and acquaintances urge me to eat more, doctors think Im sick, family members suggest I have an eating disorder. Part of this is probably just due to novelty: While eat less is standard advice for losing weight, because we all have set points no one is actually able to pull it off. Thus when someone actually does losing weight by eating less, its usually because they really are sick or something like that. But in my darker moments, I wonder if part of it is selfish. The extraordinarily thin people encouraging me to eat more, I darkly wonder, dont want me to be like them. The people who need to lose some weight dont like the example of my success. I dont like thinking this way, and I have no evidence for it, but its hard to resist.
 
Theres not much more to say; food is even less a part of my life than it was before. I still plan to lose more weight and will provide further updates accordingly. Still, since many people seem to be interested in the topic (and in keeping with the theme of my blog), a diary of my three months follows.
 
The first thing I noticed was the burping. When losing weight, it seems you burp quite a bit. But even worse is the feeling of wanting to burp. The olive oil, it seems, has inflated my stomach with gas, making me desperately want to burp, but I cant. In fact, it was so painful that I decided to stop taking the olive oil. I still ate less  it seems like once the olive oil lowered my set point, it was easy to keep things off from there. There were a couple days after eating lots where I would feel hungry for long periods of time and had to ignore it, but if I did that for a whole day, my set point went down, just like with the olive oil.
 
I went back home and saw some old friends at my high schools graduation. Many of them commented on how thin I was. I was kind of surprised, because I didnt think I was noticeably thinner yet, but I have to say I enjoyed the compliment. While on this vacation I told myself Id forget the diet and would eat all the good home foods I missed. But even doing this, I couldnt gain weight while on vacation. I was taken out to a nice restaurant downtown but couldnt finish my hamburger (which I typically had no problem doing)  when I was half way through if I took another bite I felt like I was going to throw up, so I just stopped. When I got back, I weighed basically the same as when Id left.
 
As I lost more weight I began to feel better. Id look in the mirror and notice the fat that had disappeared from my chest, or when lying down Id notice my legs were thinner. I felt like I had more energy. I felt happier. I felt more mobile, more able to move around and do things now that there was less of me. It felt wonderful.
 
One week I lost seven pounds in almost as many days and friends began to look at me with concern. But I didnt mind; I thought it was great. I had started eating significantly less, hardly anything at all really. When I moved into this new apartment (just as I was starting the diet), I thought I would have a hard time finding novel places to eat each day. But it hasnt been hard at all; Ive hardly gone out to eat by myself once since I started the diet, except to treat myself to a food I already knew I loved.
 
Writing about a gastric bypass (a surgery in which the stomach is shrunk to help those who are extremely overweight lose weight) patient, surgeon Atul Gawande describes a sensation I found extremely familiar:
 
[] She [lost so much weight that] was unrecognizable to anyone who had known her before, and even to herself. I went to bars to see if I could get picked upand I did, she said. I always said no, she quickly added, laughing. But I did it anyway.
 
The changes werent just physical, though. She had slowly found herself to have a profound and unfamiliar sense of willpower over food. She no longer had to eat anything: Whenever I eat, somewhere in the course of that time I end up asking myself, Is this good for you? Are you going to put on weight if you eat too much of this? And I can just stop. The feeling baffled her. She knew, intellectually, that the surgery was why she no longer ate as much as she used to. Yet she felt as if she were choosing not to do it.
 
Studies report this to be a typical experience of successful gastric bypass patients. []
 
(Atul Gawande, Complications, 174)
 
The newfound willpower allowed me to be more conscious about my diet. I started thinking about what foods I wanted to eat and researching the topic of nutrition. I read Walter Willetts book about the results of his epidemiological nutrition studies and begun looking at the labels of boxes I ate. I begun ordering different things at restaurants when I did eat and buying different things at the supermarket. But most of all I found myself eating less.
 
When this proved not to be enough, I found myself exercising. I seemed to be more out-of-shape now than it did when I started  I suspect with all the weight loss I lost some other things too  but exercising was probably easier to find the motivation for now. I fixed up my watch and started timing myself, trying to make sure I lost the weight I wanted to; this, of course, after I already lost twenty pounds and had stopped eating almost entirely.
 
Losing weight had other effects too, some that saved further time. Although I feel I have more energy overall, I still get tired. Sometimes I just lie in bed thinking, when I feel little pops in my thighs as my body breaks into the fat it has stored up over the years to find energy to fuel me with. And at those moments I can only smile.

A couple questions -
 
First of all, and I dont mean to be rude, how much did you initially weigh three months ago? Weight loss is relative. Its a lot easier to lose 30lbs from 200 than it is from 170.
 
Also - typically when losing weight, one hits a plateau after the first 15 lbs. Is this what you found, and decided to push through it by exercising, or was that decision a result of your newfound focus on health?
 
Next, you said youve been burping a lot. Has your breath changed? Often rapid weight loss is indicitave of ketosis, even outside fad diets like Atkins, and the breath takes on a slightly alcohol-like smell. Have you noticed any of this?
 
The reason Im asking so many niggling questions is because Ive been performing similar studies to test the effectiveness of the Shangri-La diet over the past few months. Having successfully lost weight the old fashioned way, I decided to perform some experiments on set-point. These include - trying to raise set point, finding out which flavors contribute to the flavored association, and the effects on nutrition, sleep, and muscle maintenance/growth.
 
Lastly, the popping in your thighs is not commonly reported, even with rapid weight loss. Have you heard of similar cases, perhaps in your studies of gastric bypass surgery patients?

Hi Aaron,
 
Fascinating read.  Just wanted to mention the site I work for  thedailyplate.com.  Its a site to track calories by searching for the foods you eat each day.  Might be an interesting way for you to monitor your intake of other elements (vitamins, minerals, etc) while you continue on your weight-control journey.
 
Best of luck!

It seems exceedling unlikely that those crackers could provide balanced, healthy nutrition.

But worse, it sounds like youve eliminated enjoyment of food from your life. Perhaps you didnt enjoy it before, but that sounds like an unehealthy way to live.

Are you seriously saying that all you eat some days is a few crackers?  Did you really lose 7 pounds in 7 days?
 
This is definitely not normal, and maybe the backlash you are getting from people, especially from Doctors, is something you take a little more seriously.  Think about it.  A pound of fat represents about 4000 calories.  So its basically impossible to lose a pound of fat in a day, unless you are running an ultramarathon or something.  So the question is, what else are you losing?  Some of it is probably water
 
Also, your sentance Part of this is probably just due to novelty: While eat less is standard advice for losing weight, because we all have set points no one is actually able to pull it off. is just plain wrong.  First of all, you have adopted the existence of the set point almost like a piece of religious dogma; second of all I know plenty of people who have lost weight without the benefit of the shangri-la diet.  The most common way to lose weight that Ive seen is to stop drinking soda.  It is amazingly effective.

Im glad you are feeling good, but 7 pounds in 7 days does sound a bit extreme. (From what Ive read, 1-2 pounds a week is normally considered safe, but I do know there are doctor supervised diets that have faster weight loss).
 
Personally, the oil didnt seem to do much for me (other than taste bad), but I didnt buy the book, so I possibly wasnt following the program correctly.

Im glad to hear youre enjoying eating less. I find that the edge of hunger often allows me to think more clearly and creatively as well. Too hungry, though, and my mind goes blank. Ive always been skinny, never eating quite enough, people always telling me to bulk up a little bit. So this year I made a New Years Resolution to eat more and exercise more. And wow, it is a different experience. I used to never eat breakfast, and now I do most days. I used to feel like you did with that hamburger all the time  there was only so much I could eat  but now I feel like I have more flexibility in my eating habits. There are days when I dont eat quite so much, and other days when I eat a lot more. Im also exercising a lot more than I used to. The short version of all this is that there is something to be said for moderation (as the Greeks were fond of saying). Eat enough to keep your energy, exercise enough to keep the endorphins going, and when you move to much in one direction or the other do your best to swing yourself back to the middle.

Mark: The set point isnt a Shangri-La idea; it seems to be pretty consensus among doctors, including the aforementioned Atul Gawande, who has written about it for the New Yorker and Slate. Youre welcome to dispute the studies; Im simply using the idea, it isnt dogma.

So Aaron, how do you explain the people who lose weight without using the Shangri-La diet?
 
Are they unwittingly altering their set-points?  If so, would you just say that anytime someone loses weight, theyve altered their set-point (knowingly or not), and any time someone fails to lose weight, its because they didnt alter their set-point?  Cause that sounds pretty tautological to me.
 
Put another way, can you think of an empirical result that would disprove the set-point theory?
 
posted by Mark
 on July 26, 2006 #
 
The set point is only about how you feel, not about what you actually do. In the case of food, the set point makes you hungry when you dont eat enough. Of course, you can simply be hungry and not eat, irrespective of what your set point is. The same thing is true for exercise  you can be tired and still force yourself to run. Thus, even if the set point was 100% effective (which I certainly dont claim) it wouldnt mean that people cant lose weight without adjusting it. It just means its difficult  something that strikes me as rather plain from the number of people who have failed to lose weight and keep it off.

Aaron, if what your write above is true, I really urge you to get a check-up. As a matter of probabilities, its far more likely you do have something amiss, than that you have discovered the secret to painless weight loss.
 
No, I am not writing this because I am secretly jealous of your grand discovery. I am writing this because what you describe sounds alarming. What do you mean by doctors think Im sick? I hope youre being metaphorical in I feel little pops in my thighs, because otherwise, that sounds like a neurological symptom!

Ive been on the Shangri-la Diet as well, and those feelings are what makes it all come together for me.
 
Im still in the 170s and only 55 though my waist is now down to 30 or so (it was amazing to buy my first 30/30 pants).  Ive been lifting weights the entire time and have been careful to get enough protien.
 
My target is 160, which is a perfect weight for me.
 
You hit a lot of things in your post, down to how some people will try to torpedo your weight loss.
 
Stay healthy, be careful not to give way to anorexia, and congrats.  This was a great post and Im glad to see the update.

You seem to have an obsession with being thin and losing weight, rather than being healthy.  Your description of losing a lot of weight in a week and not eating very healthily (people can only speculate with your crackers example, it would be helpful if you could list your actual diet for the last couple of weeks) alarms people, because your diet may allow you to feel less hungry but it does not change the basic laws of physics, chemistry, and biology: your body needs certain nutrients to function healthily.  Your (and the last commenters) statements about thin people not wanting you to be like them (a dead giveaway that youre obsessed with being thin) and fat people being jealous of your success make you sound like one of those people about to invest in a bridge in the middle of nowhere who when warned by his friends lashes out against them that theyre jealous that hes found such a great investment.  Its obvious that youre somewhat obsessive (with your statements about scratching yourself when you hear badly played music or other reactions to events in your life) and people are worried that youre obsessively starving yourself, perhaps with the aid of this diet, without understanding the true effects on your health.

Aaron, the last three posts to your blog have been among your best: thoughtful, smart and heartfelt.  My wife and I were talking about this one last night though and while weve been reading up on the Shangri-La Diet since you started it and it sounds fascinating this post was concerning.  Do you regularly only eat crackers for an entire day? This line seems to offer those who worry some solace: The newfound willpower allowed me to be more conscious about my diet. I started thinking about what foods I wanted to eat and researching the topic of nutrition. But just before that you say you hardly eat anything at all really I find Ajays suggestion compelling it would be helpful if you could list your actual diet for the last couple of weeks.

Why eating nothing is concerning:
 
Vitamin Deficiency (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_deficiency)
Long-term vitamin deficiency can result in diseases such as xerophthalmia or night blindness, beriberi, pellagra, pernicious anemia, pernicious anemia, scurvy and rickets.
 
Weak bones (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium)
Calcium is essential for the normal growth and maintenance of bones and teeth, and calcium requirements must be met throughout lifeLong-term calcium deficiency can lead to osteoporosis, in which the bone deteriorates and there is an increased risk of fractures. Calcium needs can be met by eating or drinking at least three or four servings of dairy products daily.

How about this first: you tell me why eating nothing is concerning.-created by Aaron Swartz
 
I suppose that is fair.  Im no expert but my understanding is that your body takes in nutrients, breaks them down and uses them to create energy (ATP) and amino acids which are then used to build and maintain your organs, bones and various systems.  These amino acids require vitamins and minerals to perform their tasks but a multi-vitamin is a supplement not a substitute for food in the first place.  Breaking down stored fat can help maintain energy levels but is also no substitute for eating, merely a way to survive on less.
 
Though Ajay is rather crude with his head-slapping response he has a point. In his article Self-experimentation as a source of new ideas: Ten examples about sleep, mood, health, and weight 
 Dr. Seth Roberts put it this way: Everyone needs to consume a certain amount of energy per day to fuel activity and metabolism. To me, it seems obvious that eating nothing is not merely concerning but over any prolonged period, dangerous.
 
In another article What Makes Food Fattening Dr. Roberts wrote During a visit to Paris, my appetite vanished. I wanted to eat three meals per day, but had to force myself to eat even one. 
 
I suppose I would argue that lack of emphasis on nutrition in food substitutes is a weakness of Dr. Roberts Shangri-la diet but these quotes illustrate that he seems to take it as an assumption.  He forced himself to eat one meal a day because he believed it was necessary for his health.
 
Which brings us back to my question: do you? Do you eat everyday for your health? Your reluctance to answer this direct question, is, at the risk of sounding rude, beginning to sound like an answer in itself. I recognize that this really none of my, or anyones, business but you have made me concerned. So, as you suggested, I first told you why I thought it was important. Now, exactly how much are you eating?

Aaron,
 
two points. First, the popping in the thighs thing is a little disturbing.
 
Secondly, the body excretes 1 g of calcium a day and needs to absorb 1 g of calcium a day. The typical multivitamin contains less than a quarter of that requirement. As a growing young man you are depositing the calcium now (until your early thirties) that you will later need as an old man. You can take additional calcium supplements, which are typically on the same shelf as the multivitamins.
 
I dont think the Shangri-La diet is a bad idea, in fact, Ive been doing some literature review on the physiology behind it, and it doesnt suck. Regardless, two crackers a day is not sustainable. You burn more than that laying motionless in a hospital bed. Do you know how they determined basal caloric need is about 2000 calories? By how much glucose they had to put in the IV drips of comatose patients in order for their bodies to maintain all the other normal physiologic functions. Also, hypocalcemia can cause delusions, heart murmurs, sudden cardiac arrest, osteoporosis, and the list goes on. Im all for the eat less method, but two crackers is not healthy by any stretch. Seven pounds in as many days is also not healthy. Understanding there is some normal day to day variation, about 2 pounds a week is the usual recommendation from dietitians.

If you lost 7 lbs one week, and 20 lbs total in three months, you averaged 1.2 lbs per week the other 11 weeks, which isnt particularly impressive.  20 lbs in three months isnt impressive to begin with. I did that last summer by riding the Charles Loop every day and switching to diet soda.
 
Youre obviously eating something other than 2 crackers per day, or else you would have lost close to 50 lbs, not a mere 20. Since you are on Shangri-La, does this mean you are drinking a pint glass of olive oil per day in addition to your crackers?
 
I dont think youre working hard enough. Your thin friends are still snickering behind your back.  Id aim for one cracker for breakfast, a shot glass of oil for lunch, and another shot for dinner.  If you can lose 40lbs in one month, it will be super impressive, and only then will you get the respect from thin people you desire.

I wanted to mention that the evidence for undereating extending your life is mostly from organisms that tend to fall on the fast and quick side of life; that is, they tend to depend on rapid, cheap reproduction. They also tend to have shorter life spans. So when theyre in environmentally unfavorable circumstances (e.g. low food) it makes a lot of sense to live longer. While in the long-life high-investment reproduction mode its better to stay on the same track, invest as much as you can in the kids that you have, and kick off on schedule so youre one less mouth to feed.

Fasting for religious and spiritual reasons has been a part of human custom since pre-history. It is mentioned in the Bible, in both the Old and New Testament, in the Mahabharata, in the Upanishads and in the Quran.
 
If we go back to stone age ..cave man may not be getting the food and nutrition everyday. As there were no super markets and drug store :-)
 
one more thing, body stores FAT for bad days only.

Aaron, I felt compelled to respond because I am a person who has recovered from an eating disorder.  Everything that you described in your post I can relate to. It feels very good to lose weight and you almost get a high from it, but not eating at least 1200 calories a day is damaging to your health. Now that I am eating healthy, small meals(5 every day)and getting a moderate amount of exercise every day, I am actually thinner then before(I am 57 female and I weigh 123) and I have SO much more energy!  I no longer feel I need to hide how little I eat from family and friends. Dietitian.com has some great information and resources (such as the healthy weight calculator). I am only writing this so that you can feel as happy and energetic as I am.

Hello there,
To lose weight is difficult, especially when in your normal work environment. Snacks and fatty food are everywhere. On Vacation it could go the same way, but there are Vacations where weight losing is possible. In theory in any giving situation you should be able to do it. Just drink 3 glasses of Water before each meal and restrain form speedy eating. Chew more frequent than you are used to and remain calm when a feeding frenzy approaches you.
 
Where to go? Well a warmer country gives you a head start, higher temperatures help to surpress the feeling of raw hunger. Then if keeping busy and away from fast food restaurants a second chance arises. One can eat healthy and learn how to acquire discipline, enough to keep on at home what you learned on Vacation. The more calories you burn and the lower your meals are the higher your chances to lose what you like least.  :dizzy:
 
kind regards

Seriously. I agree with Ajay. You are bordering on anorexia, and while olive oil is good for the body, I wouldnt suggest it as a substitution for a meal. Oil is oil is fat, theres no change in that.
 
As for the point that an earlier commenter brought up: fasting. Yes people have fasted for years and yes they are still doing it now. But have you ever fasted yourself before? Religious Fasting is NOT starving yourself of food. When fasting, you typically eat a large meal in the early morning, then fast throughout the day for about 11-13 hours. [Usually from sunrise to sunset in equatorial regions] Following sunset, you would eat another meal.
 
When you fast in such a way, you DO lose weight, albeit not much. The reason is because youve given your body enough food in the morning to sustain all your physical activities throughout the day. You lose weight because you are doing something out of your normal eating routine and your body feels the need to use up stored sugar.
 
Another point I would like to mention is that you refer to losing weight as burning fats and calories. These terms are usually used in diets and many people believe that when they lose weight, they have lost fat.
 
Your body doesnt lose fat that easily. When you need energy, your body burns glucose, a sugar you get from carbs. Too much carbs or sugar, and your body CONVERTS that glucose to another form [glycogen] and stores that. When you starve yourself, the body uses up these extra stores of glucose. When these stores of glucose are used up [which would mean you didnt eat at all for a few days, though that varies on your physical activity], then the body turns to proteins and fats. This is why people who starve themselves lose muscle mass - proteins are used to repair and maintain tissue in the body. Thus your hunch of losing something else along with the weight is correct.
 
Muscle weighs twice as heavy as fat. This is probably why you feel youve lost so much weight. Youve lost muscle mass. But not all of it, youve retained what you need to function properly. Aside from attacking proteins, the body also attacks fats. Now fats contain the most amount of energy compared to carbs and proteins. However, breaking down fats in the body tends to produce ketones, which are toxic to your body. [ketosis, as someone mentioned earlier] Ketosis can cause dehyrdration, nausea and in extreme cases can lead to gall-bladder diesease.
 
Of course, there are those who argue that the heart and kidneys prefer ketones to glucose, because ketones have more energy. However, we are all burning ketones at any one point in time, and what we burn is sufficient for these organs to use. You cant have absolutely zero fat in your body. You die when that happens.
 
And if you continue to argue by saying that the brain likes ketones, well, it doesnt. It is just merely capable of adapting to use about 50% of its energy intake on ketones. The brain STILL needs carbs.
 
And one more thing. Do you know how the body breaks down fats? It uses glucose. Your crackers definately are not providing enough for you to break down fats.
 
So, just how many crackers are you eating? And are you drinking soda? Or some other form of carb? Because really, if you had really been eating a measly helping of crackers everyday, youd have lost much more then just 20 pounds in 3 months. Unless of course you were freakishly skinny to begin with, in which case you, would probably anorexic.
 
Your view of others and over reliance on multivitamins support that you probably have an eating disorder. Multivitamins arent that good either. Too much of a good thing can harm you. Iron poisoning, calcification of the liver and kidneys [where tissue becomes hard and unusable due to the build up of calcium] can all happen.
 
Btw, lose too much muscle, and your body will start to use your heart muscle as energy to survive, in which case, you die.
 
Go check yourself into the hospital. Your eating habits are way too unhealthy.

i went through sort of the same thing when i was around 16-17 years old it worked for me.. although after a year and a half of eating one big meal a week and eat nothing for 3-4 days in between i got a little strung out and everytime i eat.. my mouth would have a burning feeling and i was shitting blood sometimes i started to ignore it and now i have an ulcer from my stomach eating itself bottom line is: it my work for a while but later on youll get tired of doing this to yourself im now 20 and weigh 185 pounds as of feb.13th 2007 and im in the best shape of my life i was incarcerated for 8 months and no one in cjc(jail) would even think of messing with me. how? i ordered an extreme exercizing program called p90x quit being lazy by not eating to lose weight. start exercizing and lose weight the right way in 4 months i went from 215 pounds to 185 pounds i feel like i can throw a car across the coors stadium,i cant, but i feel like i can if you wanna lose weight and be a skinny lookin chihuahua and live weak keep goin but if you wanna take a walk in the park with your shirt off and look like an action hero(the guys that get the hot chicks)and land a girl as cute as halle berry.. then get some motivation to exercize. women would rather have a man that can eat and carry her up to your roomnot someone who just sits there and doesnt eat, and doesnt even have the energy to keep your pole up during the finer moments i was just like you until i found the motivation to be better than anyone in the world and start exercizing you got one body,onelife keep it healthy,live long and best of all prosper from it.(get the hot chicks).

Everyone has their own way of doing things, some right some wrong, good or bad, some in betweenNo one should judge anyone for what they think or feel or do even if you think against the idea itself. There are a lot of different methods for losing weight, not all healthy ways but for what ever each person decides to try its their right to do so and I assure you , no ones opinion, rude comment, remarks of dissatisfaction, or even true genuine concern is going to change what they are doingYou decided to read their experiances, you now have to cope with your actions  and digest how it affected you without lashing out at the very thing you showed interest enough in to read. Im not saying I agree or dont with this persons method, but its their own, and as you may think one way or another on the stuff they present in blogs, or anywhere- please keep in mind you found them and you entered their existance uninvited. If you dont like what you read, STOP READING IT! There are those that will enjoy it deeply and relate and find it useful or interestingThats part of the american beauty boys & girls you have FREEDOM of self

Oh Boy, this is the most bizarre thing I have EVER read regarding weight loss.  It is common knowledge that starving ones self is unhealthy and eating a few crackers a day and a shot of olive oil is not a healthy way to lose weight.  I lost 55 lbs so far, never ate a cracker or two, never drank a mug of oil.  I did it by portion control thats right.  Simple.  Effective.  I eat anything I want and everything from all the food groups each day but I watch my portions.  If I want a burger and fries for dinner, I have it but I cut the size down.  Look, it took me 18 months to lose the 55 lbs but I didnt faint, feel hungry, starve, live off crackers and oil and I know my body remained healthy and sound.  I learned to exercise (not freakishly either) but I feel great and I PRAY all the young girls reading your article who are bombarded with visuals of super thin anorexic models every day and who listen to society when they say guys dont like fat chicks have the sense and intelligence to diet in a safe and healthy fashion regardless of the stupidity in our society today.

Ive been analyzing the content of blogs lately, looking for patterns. Its a huge amount of data, which makes for some tricky technical problems.

Title: The Techniques of Mass Collaboration: A Third Way Out
 
Im not the first to suggest that the Internet could be used for bringing users together to build grand databases. The most famous example is the Semantic Web project (where, in full disclosure, I worked for several years). The project, spearheaded by Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the Web, proposed to extend the working model of the Web to more structured data, so that instead of simply publishing text web pages, users could publish their own databases, which could be aggregated by search engines like Google into major resources.
 
The Semantic Web project has received an enormous amount of criticism, much (in my view) rooted in misunderstandings, but much legitimate as well. In the news today is just the most recent example, in which famed computer scientist turned Google executive Peter Norvig challenged Tim Berners-Lee on the subject at a conference.
 
The confrontation symbolizes the (at least imagined) standard debate on the subject, which Mark Pilgrim termed million dollar markup versus million dollar code. Berners-Lees W3C, the supposed proponent of million dollar markup, argues that users should publish documents that state in special languages that computers can process exactly what they want to say. Meanwhile Google, the supposed proponent of million dollar code, thinks this is an impractical fantasy, and that the only way forward is to write more advanced software to try to extract the meaning from the messes that users will inevitably create.[^1]
 
[^1]: I say supposed because although this is typically how the debate is seen, I dont think either the W3C or Google actually hold the strict positions on the subject typically ascribed to them. Nonetheless, the question is real and its convenient to consider the strongest forms of the positions.
 
But yesterday I suggested what might be thought of as a third way out; one Pilgrim might call million dollar users. Both the code and the markup positions make the assumption that users will be publishing their own work on their own websites and thus well need some way of reconciling it. But Wikipedia points to a different model, where all the users come to one website, where the interface for inputting data in the proper format is clear and unambiguous, and the users can work together to resolve any conflicts that may come up.
 
Indeed, this method strikes me as so superior that Im surprised I dont see it discussed in this context more often. Ignorance doesnt seem plausible; even if Wikipedia was a late-comer, sites like ChefMoz and MusicBrainz followed this model and were Semantic Web case studies. (Full disclosure: I worked on the Semantic Web portions of MusicBrainz.) Perhaps the reason is simply that both sides  W3C and Google  have the existing Web as the foundation for their work, so its not surprising that they assume future work will follow from the same basic model.
 
One possible criticism of the million dollar users proposal is that its somehow less free than the individualist approach. One site will end up being in charge of all the data and thus will be able to control its formation. This is perhaps not ideal, certainly, but if the data is made available under a free license its no worse than things are now with free software. Those angry with the policies can always exercise their right to fork the project if they dont like the direction things are going. Not ideal, certainly, but we can try to dampen such problems by making sure the central sites are run as democratically as possible.
 
Another argument is that innovation will be hampered: under the individualist model, any person can start doing a new thing with their data, and hope that others will pick up the technique. In the centralized model, users are limited by the functionality of the centralized site. This too can be ameliorated by making the centralized site as open to innovation as possible, but even if its closed, other people can still do new things by downloading the data and building additional services on top of it (as indeed many have done with Wikipedia).
 
Its been eight years since Tim Berners-Lee published his Semantic Web Roadmap and its difficult to deny that things arent exactly going as planned. Actual adoption of Semantic Web technologies has been negligible and nothing that promises to change that appears on the horizon. Meanwhile, the million dollar code people have not fared much better. Google has been able to launch a handful of very targeted features, like music search and answers to very specific kinds of questions but these are mere conveniences, far from changing the way we use the Web.
 
By contrast, Wikipedia has seen explosive growth, Amazon.com has become the premier site for product information, and when people these days talk about user-generated content, they dont even consider the individualized sense that the W3C and Google assume. Perhaps its time to try the third way out.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

Your positions are a bit too liberal/socialist for my taste. Sure, it sounds great that all the worlds information could be gathered at one web site but the reality is the complete opposite. Google recognizes that the worlds data is scattered amongst billions of web pages with sub-optimal structure and consistency.

Hello Aaron.  I think the third alternative you mention is a very important one.  Ive written before about what I see as unmistakable advantages in leveraging XML/RDF/OWL technologies in controlled environments and Im as surprised as you are that this alternative context is not in the discourse within the SW communities.  I do think it is a very unfortunate misconception (one amongst many) that the web (i.e., an open/distributed environment) is the only context that Semantic Web technologies were meant for.
 
On the other hand I believe, single purpose databases (Wikipedia can be considered as such) have much to gain in automation of content management, data manipulation, targetted querying, etc.. from applying Semantic Web technologies.  Most of the social factors that are serious issues are eleviated by a sytem that is (even somewhat) closed.
 
There are even other more intrinsic advantages: Closed world assumptions, unique name assumption, minimal semantic, ambiguity, etc..
 
I strongly believe that SW technologies are applicable to two contexts (the first being the most well known): Open, distributed systems (where the social factor can be as much a pain as catalyst) and closed, single (or minimal) purpose systems (where what you lose with closed doors you gain with precision, automation, and (other) possible oppurtunities to stream line logical reasoning in such an environment.

pwb: Im at a loss for understanding how these details of technology could be considered liberal/socialist, but your larger point seems to miss the point  as I note in the last paragraph, Google isnt collecting data, its collecting text.
 
Chimenzie: Can you say a bit more about what single purpose databases can get from Semantic Web technologies? It seems like most of the technical stuff can be better done with more standard database software while the other stuff are simply styles of thought, which I commend, but arent technologies.

I think what pwb is talking about wrt liberal/socialist is the centralization of information, as opposed to the individualist/libertarian world where everyone does their own thing.
 
But I dont think its a useful point at all.  Wikipedia is both libertarian and collectivist - libertarian because it does nothing (and can do nothing) to constrain the freedom available to those who choose not to participate, collectivist for all the obvious reasons that have been done to death.
 
I think the crucial thing about the net, and why it is such a democratizing technology, is the low start-up cost.  You hint at this when you mention forking.  On the net, it seems like a lot of the pie-in-the-sky libertarian theories might actually work.  For instance, it looks so far like consolidating power on the net is much more difficult than doing so in less malleable spheres.    People like to talk about how Google is gaining control of all information the net, but wikipedia has already proven that false.  If google wanted to suppress a piece of information, youd probably still be able to find it on wikipedia.  (And this is not even considering all the other search engines).

Central database maintainer doesnt work as a general solution.
 
Youve identified some cases where its a good specific solution, and thats certainly true.
 
But that still leaves everything else.
 
The central database solution requires a fairly large amount of money to maintain the database. In Amazons case, thats part of the ongoing business, in Wikipedias case, part of the venture capital.
 
Its not million dollar users, but million dollar website. And the problem is then youve got to have the million dollars for that niche.
Some niches - maybe even the most profitable niches - can support that. But theres still a lot which wont.

I see four potential models and only three covered:
 
Google: users dispersed, data together
Wikipedia: users together, data together
Semantic Web: users dispersed, data dispersed
?: users together, data dispersed
 
Id like to see more discussion the last one, as it seems like the best option, taking advantage of collective knowledge without creating the various problems associated with centralized data, many of which youve touched on here.

without being an expert, I think there are three problems about data here: getting the data, storing it, and retrieving it. More than the division users/data, I see a trilogy producer/storage/user. And the problem is that when you have dispersed creators with dispersed storage, then data tends to be repeated or irrelevant or very hard to find. This is what I think is the best advantage of the Wiki model. The other option is web indexes, which I havent seen any that works.
What about neural networks, or semantic analysis based web searching engines?

Title: The Fruits of Mass Collaboration
 
I often think that the world needs to be a lot more organized. Lots of people write reviews of television shows, but nobody seems to collect and organize them all. Good introductory guides to subjects are essential for learning, yet I only stumble upon them by chance. The cumulative knowledge of science is one of our most valuable cultural products, yet it can only be found scattered across thousands of short articles in hundreds of different journals.
 
I suspect the same thoughts occur to many of a similar cast of mind, since theres so much effort put into discouraging them. The arbiters of respectable opinion are frequently found to mock such grand projects or point out deficiencies in them. And a friend of mine explained to me that soon out of school he nearly killed himself by trying to embark on such a grand project and now tries to prevent his friends from making the same mistake.
 
One can, of course, make the reverse argument: since there is so much need for such organization projects, they must be pretty impossible. But upon closer inspection, that isnt true. Is there a project more grand than an encyclopedia or a dictionary? Who dares to compress all human knowledge or an entire language into a single book? And yet, theres not just one but several brands of each!
 
It seems that when the audience is large enough (and just about everyone has use for encyclopedias and dictionaries), it is possible to take on grand projects. This suggests that the hold-up is not practical, but economic. The funding simply isnt there to do the same for other things.
 
But all this is only true for the era of the book, where such a project means gathering together a group of experts and having them work full-time to build a Reference Work which can be published and sold expensively to libraries. I tend to avoid net triumphalism, but the Internet, it would seem, changes that. Wikipedia was created not by dedicated experts but by random strangers and while we can complain about its deficiencies, all admit that its a useful service.
 
The Internet is the first medium to make such projects of mass collaboration possible. Certainly numerous people send quotes to Oxford for compilation in the Oxford English Dictionary, but a full-time staff is necessary sort and edit these notes to build the actual book (not to mention all the other work that must be done). On the Internet, however, the entire job  collection, summarization, organization, and editing  can be done in spare time by mutual strangers.
 
An even more striking, but less remarked-upon, example is Napster. Within only months, almost as a by-product, the world created the most complete library of music and music catalog data ever seen. The contributors to this project didnt even realize they were doing this! They all thought they were simply grabbing music for their own personal use. Yet the outcome far surpassed anything consciously attempted.
 
The Internet fundamentally changes the practicalities of large organization projects. Things that previously seemed silly and impossible, like building a detailed guide to every television show are now being done as a matter of course. It seems like were in for an explosion of such modern reference works, perhaps with new experiments into tools for making them.

Rather than imposing an organization scheme on diverse sets of data, why not find better ways of indexing the data, and then somehow present the index to the user within the bounds of, I dont know, maybe a text box?

The problem is that theres always an economic cost, somewhere. But its undeniably true that some things are more viable now - as well as intriguingly cost-shifted.
 
Wikipedia is fascinating, since its simultaneously getting people to work for free, yet has developed formidable PR defenses for the lack of quality control, all the while being a rich guys toy which is turning into a loss-leader for a venture-capital backed business. Thats pretty amazing, though perhaps not quite in the way you might think.

Title: What Makes a Personality Scary?
 
Ive noticed recently that I sometimes find myself a little afraid of peoples personalities. Its kind of a weird experience: it makes sense to be afraid of people and other things that can hurt you, but being afraid of a personality? It doesnt make a lot of sense. Personalities can seem quirky or interesting, but scary?
 
At first, I thought this was simply an odd personal tic, since you dont exactly hear anyone else talking about it. But on reflection, you sometimes do. Imagine a movie, the heroine character learning about some shocking evil deed the brave male lead has committed. I dont even know who you are anymore, she sobs. Youre starting to scare me.
 
Whats frightening, it would seem, is that people arent the way we expected. They seemed to be brave and kind-hearted, but when the moment was right they were capable of being crafty and manipulative. Were shocked, at first, because its not what we expected. But he seemed so nice How could he do that? Then were upset, because at some level it seems like dishonesty. He made me think he was a good person, yet hes capable of so much bad. And finally, were scared, because if we were wrong about him, then our view of the world seems a little bit off.1
 
Having the world be off is frightening. I remember once I found myself at Caltrains Milbrae station late at night. Milbrae is a huge new station, a sprawling complex complete with a subway, 10 bus stops, a train, and a huge parking garage. Theres nothing really around it for quite a bit and its all open-air, with the cold night air chilling me in my shirt, as I was transferring between the subway and the train. On the way to the train tracks, I checked the schedule. The next train was at 10:47 it said; it was 10:40, so I hurried downstairs to wait for the train. I sat down and got out my book, waiting, and waiting, while the train never came. I checked the clock  it was past 10:47, well past. So I checked the downstairs schedule. There was no 10:47 train. I ran upstairs to see if the schedule Id read was simply out-of-date. It had no 10:47 train either, nothing even close. I was certain I had read it saying 10:47  the memory was clear in my mind, and Id followed the line with my finger to make sure I had the right station.
 
I suddenly got quite scared. What was going on? Was I in a dream? Was someone sneaking around the schedules on me? Was I the victim of some practical joke? The fabric of my reality was being torn  something clearly impossible had happened: a time had disappeared off a train schedule. Things werent working the way I expected.
 
I later figured out, of course, that nothing so devious had happened. In my hurry to catch the subway, Id read the wrong side of the schedule  the train was at 10:47am, not 10:47pm, and when I went back to look for the time I looked at the right side of the schedule and, naturally, the train wasnt there. But my larger point is that tears in the way we think things work are scary. If things are this bad when a piece of paper doesnt say what we expect, its not surprising that its worse when people we know dont behave the way we thought.
 
I say we here, but as I mentioned at the start, I seem to be a bit alone on this. One possibility is that Im hypersensitive to such emotions. Other people might simply feel a prick at such a scheduling anomaly, but I feel it as full-blown fear. Another (more flattering) possibility is that Im more perceptive about people than others; since others dont notice the duplicity, they dont feel the associated fear.
 
The latter makes some sense to me, as the things that make me scared of people are often very subtle, and others dont seem to recognize them at all, even when I ask them about it specifically. Even I cant quite put my finger on what it is sometime, its just a subtle signal that the person isnt being straight with you, that what theyre saying sounds honest and friendly, but is actually manipulative. Its not a pleasant feeling.
 
In talking about this sequence of emotions (shocked, upset, scared), Im referring to a logical progression, not an actual one. I dont really feel all of these things in order upon seeing someone scary, just the last. But the other emotions are what gets you to the last.

People have different emotional reactions when experiencing their view of the world being broken.  Me, i love it.  I used to switch the orientation (head to foot) of my sleeping in bed so that when i awoke i would be disoriented and have one view in my mind that might be at odds with reality.  I did that so that i could get that Oh my god, im wrong feeling again when the world suddenly twisted around me. If you experience fright, it may be that you are too accustomed to the security of being right.

Can you see it clear enought that you could talk some sense into them  or is that a contradiction ?  Can you see from an Israeli eye ?  Can you convince him that terror on terror = more terror and that you cannot wipe it out?  Is America to go on a holy war against radical Islam as William F Buckley suggests [1]? Will that help the equation?  Seeing from others eyes is a high art  we need more of it  being secure that one is right is, when things get hard, just more emotional static.

Title: The Attraction of the Center
 
Centrism is the tendency to see two different beliefs and attempt to split the difference between them. The reason why its a bad idea should be obvious: truth is independent of our beliefs, no less than any other partisans, centrists ignore evidence in favor of their predetermined ideology.
 
So whats the attraction? First, it requires little thought: arguing for a specific position requires collecting evidence and arguing for it. Centrism, simply requires repeating some of what A is saying and some of what B is saying and mixing them together. Centrists often dont even seem to care if the bits they take contradict each other.
 
Second, its somewhat inoffensive. Taking a strong stand on A or B will unavoidably alienate some. But being a centrist, one can still maintain friends on both sides, since they will find at least some things that you espouse to be agreeable with their own philosophies.
 
Third, it makes it easier to suck up to those in charge, because the concept of the center can easily move along with shifts in power. A staunch conservative will have to undergo a major change of political philosophy to get a place in liberal administration. A centrist can simply espouse a few more positions from the conservatives and a few less from the liberals and fit in just fine. This criteria explains why centrists are so prevalent in the pundit class (neither administration is tempted to really force them out) and why so many centrist pundits espouse mostly conservative ideas these days (the conservatives are in power).
 
Fourth, despite actually being a servant of those in power, centrism gives one the illusion of actually being a serious, independent thinker. People on the right and on the left already know what theyre going to say on every issue, they might claim, but we centrists make decisions based on the situation. (This excuse was recently used in a fundraising letter by The New Republic.) Of course, the situation thats used to make these decisions is simply whos currently in power, as discussed above, but that part is carefully omitted.
 
Fifth, it appeals to the public. Theres tremendous dissatisfaction among the public with the government and our system of politics. Despite being precisely in the middle of this corrupt system, centrists can claim that theyre actually independents and disagree with both the left and the right. They can denounce extremism (which isnt very popular) and play the moderate, even when their positions are extremely far from what the public believes or what the facts say.
 
Together, these reasons combine to make centrism an especially attractive place to be in American politics. But the disease is far from limited to politics. Journalists frequently suggest the truth lies between the two opposing sources theyve quoted. Academics try to distance themselves from policy positions proposed by either party. And, perhaps worst of all, scientists try to split the difference between two competing theories.
 
Unfortunately for them, neither the truth nor the public necessarily lies somewhere in the middle. Fortunately for them, more valuable rewards do.
 
Exercise for the reader: Whats the attraction of contrarianism, the ideology subscribed to by online magazines like Slate?

Well, this blog entry doesnt look like a result of collecting evidence and arguing for it. There are several allegations here  e.g. that centrists try to suck up to those in charge, that centrists try to look like independent thinkers to the public, that centrists try to be inoffensive  that are simply unsubstantiated. And theres no evidence presented to show that these centrists dont look at evidence but then again I just got meta here.
 
Theres not even a clear notion of which people you refer to when you talk about centrists. Does Bill Clinton count as a centrist, for instance? What about Hillary Clinton? Howard Dean? C. S. Lewis? Ayn Rand? Time for some Lakoff again.

What Aaron is describing exists in other countries, too. But it may sometimes be called differently. The  Golden Mean Fallacy, which is a subset of the phenomenon described in the article, is quite popular with any population.
 
btw: Note that even in Germany, which has now 5 parties in parliament (recently up from 4), the usual political frames string them up along a one dimensional unit, and they talk a lot about the center - which is between the larger two parties are (together around 70%). So I dont buy the criticism that this post someho shows the deficiency of the two party system in the US. (Note that I do agree that the deficiency is real, I am merel saying it has little relevance to the article).

Do these conclusions apply just to centrist pundits and politicians seeking power, or are you trying to apply this (not well evidenced, as noted above) opinion to the greater US population of centrists?
 
Yes, it does seem that many politicians jump on the centrist bandwagon to procure votes.  Im not a fan of that tactic.  Centrists I know dislike it as well.  However, I dont believe centrism is in anyway harmful to our political system or the well-being of our democracy.  In fact, Ill be so bold as to say centrism is a good thing.
 
By your own admission, centrists ignore evidence in favor of their predetermined ideology no less than any other partisans.  What youre really saying, then, is that theyre no less right or wrong than any other political party?  Super. It is, however, another option for people.
 
So, tell me again why you care if centrism exists and how its ultimately bad for the US?

Independent views of any type (that is, views substantially different from the two party lines) are essentially useless in the US due to the spoiler effect which in turn is due to the simple majority voting scheme we use.  Switching to Condorcet or Austrlian-style voting would make such positions more tenable.  Until we do so, however, independent centrist candidates should be ignored or should instead co-opt the system by becoming the nominee of the party closer to their views.

OK, so now that we know that centrists dont base their positions on evidence, lets make another kangaroo-like leap from centrists to centrism. Voila!

But is politics really about truth? I think theres a base set of decisions that should be made based on what is logical which everyone (on the left, center AND right) should aspire to, but then that leaves us with a lot of decisions that people disagree on where neither side is right. With those decisions, I think its dangerous for anyone to claim they know what the right decision is and compromises from both sides should be made. I feel like, ideally, centrists try to make those compromises while still sticking to logical decisions (where a compromise is not logical).

I think centrism is a political misnomer is many instances. For instance, myself, I have strong views on issues that fall fairly equally into conservative, progressive, and libertarian planks. I have strong beliefs about right to own and bear arms and oppose abortion. But Im for social safety net deals like minimum wage, labor protection, and social security too. And, I believe strongly about civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, i.e., 4th amendment issues.
 
But a stronger impetus for politican centrism is the shapeshifter ability to be perceived as falling on either side of the issue. Not taking a definitive stance, but yet issuing code key syntax in speeches or other PR ploys to give adherents of a position fodder for believing the candidate is sympathetic to their policy wishes.

I guess I dont see independent and centrist as mutually exclusive.  Yes, there are independents (and were talking about independent with a little i here) who eschew both parties for a different set of ideologies.  But there are also a lot of people who consider themselves independent but have centrist ideologies.  They pick positions on issues that may be in line with either of the major parties.  Again, Im still not certain how this is wrong.  Apparently, its wrong because Aaron says its wrong.

Bart brings up a point which I think is important.  In the world of politics and debate, issues that are black and white are rarely debated.  It is the gray issues that spark the fiercest debate.  Why? Because there is no universal right or wrong answer.

Nicole: as Rumsfeld tells us, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns - the ones we dont know we dont know. Often there is no universal right or wrong `answer is really a code for actually theres a whole lot of data to tell us what the right answer is, but looking at data is boring, so lets take a cue from Rumsfeld  instead of focussing on whats known, lets focus on whats unknown. And you cant criticize me based on something thats unknown, can you? w00t!
 
Therefore, never mind that James Madison explicitly wrote in support of extended government, and Benjamin Franklin wrote against absolute property rights  if you oppose small government libertarianism, youre going against the Founding Fathers wishes and distorting the Plain Meaning(tm) of the US Constitution! (Dont believe me? Look for the web site named Ravenwoods Universe and click Libertarianism.) Really, many heatedly debated issues do have universal right or wrong answers, its just that some people choose to ignore evidence in favour of their own pet answers. Rumsfeld 1, evidence 0.

Some employees of the media industry actually are conspicuous centrists; they claim to be unbiased, and as evidence point out their product stands right in the middle of the two big factions, giving equal attention to both.
 
Of course, we can try a thought experiment. Take any official enemy nation we can think of; suppose a citizen considered himself a centrist for having beliefs right in the middle of two powerful government factions. How seriously would most people we know respect this centrism?

You may be forgetting the importance of centrism in the process of the dialetic. Without the synthesis of two ideas, there would be no advancement. Never underestimate the power of the dialectic, as the synthesis becomes the new thesis, then a new antithesis merges with the old centric view to become the new synthesis, and so on, and so on.
 
As for contrary statements, Ive often wondered how many confuse it for being diverse in outlook. For evolution of thought (and advancement in the dialectic mentioned above), its required for two contrary thoughts to exist at the same time.

I think many centrists (including myself), dont attempt to see two different beliefs and attempt to split the difference between them, but rather take two different beliefs, find the common ground between them, and make progress where agreements can be made.
 
Take the abortion issue. Most people in both the pro-life camp and the pro-choice camp believe that there should be fewer rather than more abortions, regardless of a womans right to have one.  So instead of constantly battling over the fundamental right, why dont legislators put effort into education, counseling, and other programs that reduce the number of abortions?  That doesnt involve either side giving up their fundamental view, but makes positive progress on the issue rather than wasting time fighting.

100 years ago right-wingers believed that the human mind was shaped by nature and not by nurture. This resulted, for instance, in racist imperialists believing that they were doing good because the darkies were better off being ruled by the white man.
 
Today, thanks to science, we know that the truth is somewhere in the middle. Anyone who held a centrist position in this matter 100 years ago was the closest to being correct.

Well, you are used to living in a very polarized political system and, maybe, your views can be in such case somewhat justified and reasonable. I, on the contrary, come from a country of a multi-party system and believe me, day by day more and more people (including me) are getting so fed up with all these political battles between the right and the left side, that centrism seems to be the only alternative, the only positive point among this whole mess. Im not saying that exactly this political option is unquestionably the best, but, if you really think that it is such a bad idea, then please, come to my country and try to convince all these frustrated people of it Good luck!

Just wanted to give some examples of middle Ground
 
Some people claim that God is all powerful, all knowing, and all good. Other people claim that God does not exist at all. Now, it seems reasonable to accept a position somewhere in the middle. So, it is likely that God exists, but that he is only very powerful, very knowing, and very good. That seems right to me.
 
Congressman Jones has proposed cutting welfare payments by 50% while Congresswoman Shender has proposed increasing welfare payments by 10% to keep up with inflation and cost of living increases. I think that the best proposal is the one made by Congressman Trumple. He says that a 30% decrease in welfare payments is a good middle ground, so I think that is what we should support.
 
A month ago, a tree in Bills yard was damaged in a storm. His neighbor, Joe, asked him to have the tree cut down so it would not fall on Joes new shed. Bill refused to do this. Two days ago another storm blew the tree onto Joes new shed. Joe demanded that Joe pay the cost of repairs, which was $250. Bill said that he wasnt going to pay a cent. Obviously, the best solution is to reach a compromise between the two extremes, so Bill should pay Joe $125 dollars.

Your examples of centrism being sensible absurd and you provide no evidence for them. Either God exists or doesnt  we cant compromise by taking away some of his powers. Either welfare is helpful or not  we cant make it better by only raising funding a little bit. And perhaps the Joe thing is reasonable but its hardly a political issue; in politics such complaints are inevitably more formalized so the right thing is more obvious.

Title: The Hard Sciences
 
If we say that science is the goal of trying to figure things out about the world, then we see the sciences broadly classified into two categories: hard and soft. In the former are subjects like physics, biology, and perhaps the honorary inclusion of mathematics. The soft sciences, by contrast, include fields like history, psychology, sociology, and economics.
 
As you might gather from the terms involved, partisans of the hard sciences often look down upon the softer sciences, considering them barely worthy of the term science at all. Indeed, the soft sciences rarely formulate general laws or clear predictions, as the harder sciences sometimes do. But why is that?
 
The reason is, because the soft sciences are, in fact, harder. Humans are far more complicated than atoms, trying to figure out how they work is a great deal more difficult than coming up with the rules of mechanics. As a result, the social sciences are less well developed, which means theres less to study, which means the fields are easier to learn.
 
Nonetheless, since the field is so much harder, the people who make progress in it should get more respect. Physicists can isolate atoms and run an experiment; historians have to try to find clever ways to make a natural experiment.
 
Obviously, the progress has to be actual, rather than simply perceived, which is indeed a common confusion in the social sciences, but real observers of science should reconsider who they esteem.

One way in which hard sciences are more difficult than soft sciences is that, since theyre more well-developed, it becomes progressively harder and harder to discover new and interesting things about them. For example, its pretty much a dead end to try and discover new chemical elements, since elements with high atomic numbers have half-lives too short to be of use.
 
Of course, whether its a hard or a soft science, the practitioner shouldnt abandon the scientific method and resort to telling just-so stories. A historian may not be able to formulate any general Laws of History, but its no excuse for him to make up stuff about the founding of the Ottoman Empire, for example.

the people who make progress in it should get more respect.
 
I think the keywords there are make progress.
 
Too many people dont.
 
And I believe part of the disrespect comes from the attitude of many in the social sciences that since its about humans, having mathematical and experimental rigor is somehow offensive, or inversely, that it validates nonsense.

Another thing to note is that there is no objective experiment in the soft sciences in any reasonable sense of the word. Indoctrination, culture, affects the result of any experiments. Any laws at the level the soft sciences deal with things, only hold as long as people believe in them. So, perhaps soft should be understood in the sense that there are less hard facts 
(without getting too philosophical about the concept of fact here) than in the hard sciences, or any hard fact would be too complex to be meaningful.

Good thinking, i agree with it for the most part; but i think you goofed on this one  As a result, the social sciences are less well developed, which means theres less to study, which means the fields are easier to learn.  keeping with your train of though here me thinks that though should have come out as As a result, the social sciences are less well developed, which means theres more wrong information to sort through, which means the fields far harder to learn.

I always thought the soft sciences were labeled that way because the claims made by their practitioners are presented as backed by research that isnt actually science. (Usually it isnt really reproducible, and this is because, like you say, humans are really complicated.)

In a way, the fact that the foundations of these fields arent well-known, does make it a bit easier for people to get away with pseudo-scientific junk.
 
History is a sort of special case, I think: the goal of a historian isnt to discover general laws, but to ascertain which events happened when. And in this task the typical historian is quite scientific indeed.

It does, thanks. Thats pretty much what I got out of my four years (thought it was never explicitly stated), and I guess I liked that because I liked interesting more than predictable at the time, but I dont think thats the same criteria thats used to measure progress in the hard sciences.
 
The big advances in the hard sciences, seems to me, are incredibly boring because theyre so obvious in hindsight - they just formally describe the familiar physical world in ways that make it more predictable. So Im not sure it makes any sense to compare the hard and soft sciences like this.

Really? As Howard Gardner notes (The Unschooled Mind) a lot of physics is not what youd expect. Most everyone has a model of the world, for example, in which things use up force and eventually run out. The idea of Newtonian mechanics  that a body in motion will stay in motion without any additional force  is pretty shocking; even more so for the fact that outer space proves it to be so.

I take some exception to the claim that to come up with interesting results in the hard sciences is easy. The basics of the hard sciences are accessible, sure, but they have either been explored beyond hope for a lot of new and interesting discoveries (physics) or are still understood so little that its hard to get answers to many simple questions (biology).
 
Even where the basics are now well understood, the picture is not as simple as meets the eye. Look at what physics was like in 1700AD: most theories were based on intuition, many things were simply mysterious, and the idea of rigor was in diapers. Sure looks a lot like the soft sciences do now, no? And you know, except from the fact that we now know more about what proper rigor entails (though it would seem hubristic to claim that weve learned all about it), thats still what the hard sciences look like at their forefronts. Read up on dark matter, dark energy, accelerated expansion, and the like. Noone has the faintest idea about any of these things, despite how long weve known about them. (No less than three decades in the case of dark matter; who knows if its even there. Maybe its just like the ether, and we need a new Einstein to bring about another radical realignment of our existing understanding.) Or take string theory: its been in discussion for some half a century, and it remains mostly without any avenue of experimental confirmation. Besides all that, theres the mundane fact that to make any interesting discoveries in particle theory or astronomy requires millions in equipment.
 
So its not at all easy to make material progress in the hard sciences.
 
Now consider medicine, which, like many of the soft sciences, has been practiced in some form for the entire history of mankind. Like the soft sciences, it consisted almost entirely of conjecture, superstitution and plain rubbish until the then emerging understanding of rigor began to inform it. Like the soft sciences, it looked difficult to achieve rigor in, until people started losing their superstitions and knowing more.
 
Some sciences are soft now because we live in their Middle Ages. They are full of conjecture and superstititions. Their Newtons and Einsteins, if there ever will be any, are far in the distant future.
 
So I would say its understandable why some look down on the soft sciences; but I agree with you that to do so is mistaken, even as I disagree that there is any substantial basis on which to rank any of the sciences against each other. All of them are important.

I am fascinated to be reading non-scientific arguments about science by seemingly very intelligent people.  Are you all making true truth statements about science that cannot proven using science?  Thus, you have to use arguments from a system more powerful than science to talk about science?
 
In very simple math terms, Aaron argues that psychology > physics.  But what are the basic axioms?  Lets simplify.  How do you go about proving English > Java formally?
 
Is a hard scientist more likely to ask these stupid questions?

Theres essentially a chain of envy in these disciplines.  The scientists and engineers envy the mathematicians freedom from boring experiments/raw data and their intellectual rigor (the guy who commented before me is obviously an example, with his use of mathematical symbols and call for axioms).  The sociologically-oriented disciplines in turn envy the certainty that physical experiments can bring and their mathematical rigor.  However, as you point out, these disciplines are fundamentally different, as the level and types of complexity that they deal with varies.  Whats funny is that they often just ape those that they envy, without understanding either how to properly wield the intellectual tools they appropriate or the larger structure of the field they operate in.  Take for example economics, and how they try to use a lot of math that isnt really necessary.  They do this because they have seen the physicists do the same and it obscures the intellectual murkiness of their arguments.

The soft sciences are harder than the hard sciences only in the sense that trying to nail jelly to a tree is harder than trying to nail a piece of wood to a tree. That is, frequently, the soft sciences are engaged in endeavors that dont make sense. Meanwhile, the hard sciences are almost exclusively engaged in useful prediction. Examples:
 
Physics made all the predictions we now use to make cars, computers, etc, etc.
 
The field of ethnic studies has pondered the nature of various marginalized groups for the purpose of being politically correct. No useful results have come from them. How do I know? Well, unlike physics with cars, I can assuredly point to no aspects of everyday life that have been in any way changed or improved by the study of ethnic studies.
 
There are exceptions to this rule, such as the 1980s approach to AI (an example of a semi-hard science (CS) nailing jelly to a tree), but theyre fairly rare, and tend to end up inescapably abandoned.

Title: Release Late, Release Rarely
 
When you look at something youre working on, no matter what it is, you cant help but see past the actual thing to the ideas that inspired it, your plans for extending it, the emotions youve tied to it. But when others look at it, all they see is a piece of junk.
 
You only get one chance to make a first impression; why have it be junk? Once thats associated with your name or project, its tough to scrape off. Even people who didnt see it themselves may have heard about it second-hand. And once they hear about it, theyre not likely to see for themselves. Lifes too short to waste it on junk.
 
But when you release late, after everything has been carefully polished, you can share something of genuine quality. Apple, for example, sometimes releases stupid stuff, but it always looks good. Even when they flub, people give them the benefit of the doubt. Well, it looks great but I dont really like it is a lot better then its a piece of junk.
 
Still, you can do better. Releasing means showing it to the world. Theres nothing wrong with showing it to friends or experts or even random people in a coffee shop. The friends will give you the emotional support you would have gotten from actual users, without the stress. The experts will point out most of the errors the world would have found, without the insults. And random people will not only give you most of the complaints the public would, theyll also tell you why the public gave up even before bothering to complain.
 
This is why release early, release often works in open source: youre releasing to a community of insiders. Programmers know what its like to write programs and they dont mind using things that are unpolished. They can see what youre going to do next and maybe help you get there.
 
The public isnt like that. Dont treat them like they are.

Im a bit confused about this post. It seems like it is in stark contrast to the strategy taken with Infogami. Am I missing something?

You cant really compare Apple to a smaller development firm whos using agile practices.  Apple has tons of developers for each project, all of which work in concert towards one goal.  If youre using agile development, the release early/release often isnt that you release your product to customers which would purchase it out of your web store in that state.  You release software to your client (i.e. someone who comissioned a piece of software or someone that has a specific, urgent need for that software that you will be selling).  I dont think any software house would ever release something they knew wasnt polished enough for release and expect it to sell.  I do think they would release something that is polished and usable with the expectation of improving on it (which, one could argue, is the Apple Way), but never something they knew was a pile of crap.

infogami is  full of barely started wikis. This is party because its soo half-baked. It just downt provide some of the tools necessary to build the kind of sites it claims to help build. Now if you had released the source, others wouldve (maybe) contributed and offered suggestions. tbh infogami generated much exitement, because there are many who need a good bliki. but one which would work with third party tools (metaweblog/blogger API??), maybe google sitemaps, paid features (space for images,db,webpy scipts) etc. as for apple software dev, read mark pilgrim switch story.

Releasing early & often means you get a reputation for producing concrete things & for constantly improving them.
 
Releasing late & rarely means that you get a reputation for vaporware & that your products almost always disappoint the customer (or investor). (Who notices every little flaw.)
 
Unless you have the resources to develop a complete, polished application without having to hype it up to potential customers or investors
 
In my experience, even non-technical customers will respect youin the long run if not beforeif you develop a reputation of regularly delivering improvements.
 
Indeed, look at Apple. Mac OS X, iLife, the MacBook Prostheyve released stuff that was half-baked, but theyve also developed a reputation of constant improvements.
 
Yeah, they get the pretty in up-front, but thats relatively easy. (& creates the old problem of the manager/customer thinking the application is close to being feature complete simply because the UI looks complete.)

Infogami failed because you released early, but then failed to release often. People saw it and tried it early on the assumption that it would get better, and then you let it flop. What you should be saying is that one shouldnt release early and then forget about it, because then people will remember you for releasing an alpha product, having people try it, and then abandoning it.

Title: Whats Freedom?
 
George Lakoff is a prominent cognitive scientist whose central insight (which is not to say that the idea originates with him) is that we can learn about the structure of our thoughts by looking carefully at the words we use to express them. For example, we think of time as a line, as you can see through phrases like time line, looking forward, further in the past, etc. Similarly, we thinking is thought of as a kind of seeing: do you see what I mean?, pulled the wool over your eyes, as you can see from the book, his talk was unclear, that sentence is opaque, etc.
 
Lakoff used these techniques to write a series of books describing the structures of various ideas (Metaphors We Live By, Philosophy in the Flesh, Where Mathematics Comes From, etc.) but after the Republican Revolution of 1994, he turned the technique on politics, resulting in his 1996 classic Moral Politics, which tries to explicate the cognitive models of Democrats and Republicans.
 
After the election of Bush2, Lakoff began talking about how Republicans were better at framing, or using language to get people to agree with them, than Democrats. Lakoff that the process goes both ways: language causes your mind to think of certain concepts which create certain pathways in your brain. Thus Republicans, he said, through massive repetition of certain phrases, were literally changing the brains of the electorate to be more favorable to them. (If this sounds a bit scary, he writes, it should. This is a scary time.)
 
Around the 2004 election, Lakoff skyrocketed to fame among Democrats, who were convinced by his argument that fighting Republicans required not just giving into Republican frames, but reframing the debate themselves. He rushed out the slender book Dont Think of an Elephant, a cobbled-together guide on his basic ideas and how progressives could use them. The book stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for weeks.
 
Now Lakoff is back with a more studied work, Whose Freedom?, which tries to focus in more detail on the differing views of one particular concept: freedom. Lakoff starts the book by noting that in his 2004 speech at the Republican convention, Bush used freedom, free, or liberty once every forty-three words. Most progressives think of this simply as a stunt  using feel-good symbols like flag and words like freedom to distract from the real issues. But Lakoff argues something much deeper is going on: Bush is trying to change the meaning of freedom itself.
 
So what is he trying to change it to? Right away, the book begins to fall apart. Lakoffs definition of freedom is so broad (it encompasses democracy, opportunity, equality, fairness, education, health, the press, the market, religion, the military, academia, and privacy) as to be fundamentally meaningless: Every progressive issue is ultimately about freedom, he concludes. And yet freedom is kept on as the books organizing principle: instead of chapters about economics, religion, and foreign policy, we have the chapters Economic Freedom, Religion and Freedom, and Foreign Policy and Freedom.
 
This would be harmless if it was simply a rhetorical affectation, but Lakoff still seems to think is fundamentally about freedom. As a result, the chapters are not only weighed down with meaningless and silly attempts to connect the topic to freedom (Life is a progressive issue, since progressive Christians are committed to promoting freedom, freedom from oppression and pain and freedom to realize ones dreams.  actual quote) but their actual substance is stripped bare, because its not discussed in its own right, but merely as an aid to the books discussion of freedom.
 
Thus instead of deriving his key theory of how family metaphors create political views, by showing how he discovered this and how it explains a lot about the world, he quickly asserts it and then tries to apply the idea to the empty void of freedom. The result is a book that is fundamentally vacuous  its main idea has no substance and its supporting ideas have no explanation.
 
And for a linguist, Lakoff has a surprisingly tin ear for language. His suggestions (like using the term freedom judges to respond to activist judges) are so bad that I assume they must not be meant to be taken literally (judges that will fight for freedom is more akin to what Lakoff means).
 
Its unclear how the book got into this sorry state, but the good news is theres hope. Lakoffs Rockridge Institute has been putting out thoughtful and valuable guides on how to think and talk about various issues and they plan to publish their major work, the Progressive Manual, this summer. Let us hope that book does what this could not.
 
Disclosure: I received a free review copy of Lakoffs book fedexed to me before the July 4 publication date.

This is a criticism of Lakoff similar to that which many intelligent progressives make:  his ideas are either so broad or so narrow as to be hollow.  The grounding for the ideas in Whose Freedom? is to be found in Moral Politics:  how Liberals and Conservatives Think.  Clearly, Lakoff could not compress the 400+ page Moral Politics into this rather slim volume.  Look closely at what Lakoff writes about how progressives still function within a rationalist theory of mindand how it makes it difficult for them to understand what Lakoff calls higher reason.

Just finished reading Whose Freedom  I picked up a copy this weekend (it was featured in the new books section of Borders).
 
While I dont think its the equal of Moral Politics, I didnt think it was as bad as you panned it
 
In fact, the chapter breaking down GWBs inauguration speech is a treasure, and it really should have been an early chapter, as it seems to me to be the impetus for the book. That the right wing wraps everything into a freedom frame, but that the freedom they speak of is laced with code words and key phrases that not only tap their base, actually are successful in adjusting connotative realm for the concept.
 
My criticism of Lakoff here is that it seems that hes playing defense again. Responding to the assaults isnt as an effective strategy as declaring the terms of battle. While Lakoff is on the mark regarding framing and the rhetorical instruments employed, knowing and being aware is only an initial step. I think the ball is being dropped if further pursuit and emphasis fails to remedy the unbalance.
 
IMV, a more effective approach would be:
 
implore those favorable to progressive cause that possess resources to focus those resources in the same (or better, improved methods) creation, nurturing and support of progressive think tanks centered on the big picture instead of issue oriented
 
Lakoff and his organization need to work on their web presence, and offer tools to everyone seeking books with general theme is nice but more pragmatic and topical essays would be a much greater benefit.
 
building a true network of freedom proponents  at the back of the book there are a few web sites recommended, and the ones there seem to be pure party partisans as opposed to educating and informing

naum: using the same tactics as the Republicans will only allow us to be on par with them. And remember that they have other tactics that arent really at our disposal: smear campaigns, attack dogs, sock puppetry, 
 
To truly defeat them, not just be on par, we will also need totally different methods. One way forward, I think, is shown by the success of Godwins Law. And remember this: in my opinion, its a fact!

Your critique is also fundamentally flawed.
GWB is trying to indoctrinate the US people of what freedom is with his rethoric. Hes trying to mold the impression in peoples minds, and connect it to a perceived threat.
 
Freedom may be something innately subjective and based on ones experience. It is not something easily taught, but when you instigate fear of losing something vital like freedom, the emotional irrationality easily overshadows the real concept.
 
That seems to be Lakoffs main message, and does not seem far from the truth, even if he fails in proving the details.
 
doh!

For the benefit of readers, the Whos Freedom? book has a chapter on how to talk to partial- conservatives, how to activate the progressive aspects of their personality.  Lakoff also stresses that his book is a guide, not a campaign manual.  His 2 recent paperbacks - Thinking Points and Dont Think of An Elephant - are more geared to that end.
 
We must learn to express themselves in terms of progressive- friendly frames and to help to build them.  Politicians cant do it alone, otherwise they are talking to a public in words and phrases they will not accept.  They must have our help to develop the language - and as you found out, it is tough mental work.  The conservative right has a 30 year headstart and 40 think tanks churning out their messages.
 
Ive read five of his books, including his first.  None of them have indexes and I have no idea why.  It is annoying, but not so much as seeing neocom talking-points dominate a political landscape instead of reason.

Title: A Clarification
 
A lot of people seem to have misunderstood my piece A Non-Programmers Apology and my blog more generally. Let me explain:
 
I am 19 and live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in an apartment with two others. The three of us together work full-time on the site reddit.com and I spend most of my days working on programming and various related tasks for it.
 
In the nights and weekends I read and think and write. Im working on a large book project, which I expect to take years, and which I dont discuss much on the Web.
 
I also think about lots of things, many of which dont relate to either reddit or the book project. When a thought crystalizes I type it up and post it to my blog. I dont read it before I post it, I dont show it to anyone, and I dont edit it. I literally sit down and type one word after another and hit save and hit upload. (Obviously, there are some exceptions, but this is standard practice.)
 
If you think the writing here is poor, thats probably why. Real writing takes editing. But I dont consider this writing, I consider this thinking. I like sharing my thoughts and I like hearing yours and I like practicing expressing ideas, but fundamentally this blog is not for you, its for me. Im sorry. Maybe that isnt how it should be, but at least for now thats how it is. In my defense, nobodys making you come here.
 
I plan to keep doing this until the company fails or becomes a huge success.
 
Afterwards, I hope to work on the book project (and a related project) full time.
 
I hope that clears things up.

Heres my theory on why people are pissed at you for posting drivel:
 
In the past, youve written many inspired and well-argued posts.  Youve also written crappy ones going way back, but people forget about the crappy ones pretty quickly, and start thinking Aarons weblog is really fascinating!  So they keep coming back, but occasionally have their (false) expectations disappointed by nonsense about how Bach sucked or how the Shangri-La diet is going to re-make society.  I think this clarification is fairly dishonest, as many of your recent posts have very clearly involved more work than type, save, upload.
 
My advice would be for you to fork this blog.  Have one blog for things like your Non-programmers Apology and book reviews and other interesting stuff, have a second one for pithy little bon-bons that you dash out in 15 minutes.

You cant really say every single entries you put on here is same kind. If you are really working on book, web applications, youd better label/distinguish them, whats raw, whats essential but also raw, - or some casual thoughts.
 
If you are REALLY talented or hard working writer and/or programmer, youd sense the need to do that kind of labeling and structuring. (to work with people at many levels and setting.)

As someone that often wonders how to separate work from life, thoughts into categories that make my words have meaning to anyone that should venture into my world - I see your writing as just that YOUR Writing.  Your blog, your writing and what you choose to write is yours to do with as you wish.  People can read, comment, have opinions but to question why you write something in one place rather than another.  Unless you hire me to be your editor (not likely) then its not my job to try to edit your work.
 
Life is tangential.  Work is ordered but random ideas and clever words can tip your work world as much as anything else.  If a blog becomes an entity - a shadow of you - it will show in your writing, your passions, your conflicts, your ideas.  As with people, this entity will resist being categorized.
 
Your narrative will be yours to define - you are doing it well.

Your thinking out loud makes me think about things that might not normally cross my mind, gives me things to discuss with friends over dinner & drinks, that sort of thing.

Title: In Offense of Classical Music
 
I recently had to sit through a performance of Bachs Well-Tempered Clavier at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (it was the conductors farewell concert). At first it was simply boring, but as I listened more carefully, it grew increasingly painful, until it became excruciatingly so. I literally began tearing my hair out and trying to cut my skin with my nails (there were large red marks when the performance was finally over). The pianist, I was certain, kept flubbing the notes and getting the timing off. But few around me seemed to agree. Well, he certainly plays it differently from Gould, was the most they could say.
 
The audience, like that of private libraries and the FOX News Channel, was decidedly old. I dont recall seeing anyone who looked younger than thirty. And, aside from thoughts of this whole orchestras-playing-classical-music thing dying out, it made me wonder: whats so great about classical music?
 
Ask the old folks there and theyll tell you that nothing really compares. Listen to the stuff on the radio today and its all simply repetitive melodies with stupid lyrics. And the thing is, theyre right: the stuff on the radio does suck for the most part. But thats not really a fair comparison.
 
When I listen to good modern music, it takes my heart in its hands and plays with it as it pleases  makes me soar, makes me sad, excited, and mad. But when I listen to classical music, at most it simply occupies my brain for a while. Is this simply a flaw in my perception or has music really improved?
 
I think its possible to argue that music is actually getting better. As humans, we clearly share a number of genetically-encoded similarities, perhaps with some variation. For example, we almost all have two eyes, although in different shapes, sizes, and colors. Imagine that we are similarly endowed with some shared sense of musical appreciation (or, put another way, emotional susceptibility). We all fall for the same musical things, again with some variation.
 
If this is the case (and while I cant really prove it, it seems at least plausible to me that it is), then there would indeed be objective standards for measuring music: better music would be more appreciated by the average person or the majority of people or some such. And if there are objective standards for measuring music, then music can get better.
 
And, if we again imagine that whats appreciated in music isnt simply random, that it involves certain traits (which seems pretty clear, although again hard to prove), then not only can music get better, but it probably will. Musicians will listen to old music, the majority of them will enjoy the good songs of the past, and theyll try to build upon and improve that good material, following its patterns, creating even better music. And the next generation will do the same, from a further along starting point.
 
Does this prove that the latest Aimee Mann album (The Forgotten Arm) is the best work of music yet to be created by humans? Of course not. But it does mean its at least possible, that Im not completely crazy for thinking so.

Maybe one of the reasons old people like it is for what it represents.
Im thinking about my grandparents, they probably started going to hear classical music because it was  what people from good families did. They associate a good feeling of status with the music, so the music sounds better than it is (also, they got used to it and learnt to appreciate it).
In contrast, modern music may seem to them too mainstream? Even if you find modern music unknown to anyone else, it is still pretty cheap, right?
 
Or maybe theyre just deaf.

While a lot of new music is bad, a lot of classical is too. However there is also a fair chunk of very very good classical music, that when played well can be just as captivating and moving.

Your thoughts towards objective standards reminded me of an aesthetics class that I took a few semesters ago. Im no expert, but I did learn that there are an infinite number of ways to look at beauty and perfection, both traits of better music.
 
I do see a correlation to the passage of time and the evolution of music, though I know that more factors than building upon experience are involved, such as cultural and social experiences or the desire to be distinct and unique (e.g., blues or punk).
 
Its certain that many artists try to be better than their predecessors, to take the older sounds and derive from it; but, it simply becomes ones own, and not necessarily better.
 
Looking at the soundscape now, I see so many avenues, veins, and alleys that I truly enjoy for their aesthetic, emotional value. Classical music, to a certain degree, takes me on that emotional trip. The post-rock band from Wales, Mogwai, takes me there too, but on a different road.
 
To some degree, I think you have a higher music which does explore and create new and exciting sounds. To the contrary, you have the music that just participates in whats alraedy been cleared for them. In one hand, you have pioneers, and the other you have participants. True, both are active, but one is evolving, changing, and letting you experience new things, whereas the other is simply visceral.
 
This is not distinctly bad, though, because it is an experience. It just gives you the opportunity to chose which you like better: the more experimental, pioneering music or the more traditional (i.e., normal, popular) music.
 
Either way, we like what we like for whatever reason at whatever time. I like Mogwai and I like Brahms, but I also like Tilly and the Wall, Arcade Fire, Death Cab For Cutie, Sufjan Stevens, and Bright Eyes. Some of that is experimental, while others (and parts of others) are popular.
 
Beauty is in the ear of the beholder. To some degree.
 
Sorry for the long comment.

Although I dont really want to take part in your argumentation (dancing about architecture, you know) theres one nice circular definition that I personally find really interesting, time after time:

better music would be more appreciated by the average person or the majority of people or some such.
 
So dogs playing poker and velvet Elvises would be better art than Picasso then?  Appealing to the lowest common denominator is not necessarily the best metric for quality.
 
There is a lot of formulaic classical music in the world.  There is also some totally mind-blowing amazing classical music.  Part of listening to classical music is taking the time to understand and internalize the structures within which the composers were working, to understand the societal context they lived in.  We dont have to work as hard to understand todays music because we share the same context as todays composers.  Does that mean that todays music is better or just easier for us to understand?
 
Ive had many transporting experiences with classical music.  I dont know if thats because it was all that was played in my home growing up, or because I have many years of musical training.  But good classical music can affect me far more deeply than any pop music; there is a depth to it that stands up to repeated listening.  Its not for everybody, and may not be for you, but that doesnt mean that it should be dismissed entirely.

Isnt it at least as reasonable to assume that anything we still listen to (or read or view) after a few centuries is well adapted? That the greatest work by Shakespeare or Mozart or Michelangelo comes closer to approaching perfection than the vast majority of whats currently being produced?
 
The same argument can be made for Lisp or C: they may not be perfect, and many people produce ill-advised programs in Lisp or C, just as the pianist you saw in Chicago may well have flubbed notes or had questionable timing. But if youre going to try to make an argument for the best programming languages currently available, dont you first have to explain why so many people who are trained to appreciate languages subtleties still use Lisp and C? To me at least, that seems more reasonable than pointing to a straw mans iffy code and deciding that Croma is the best programming language yet created by humans.
 
I understand your argument: Croma has benefitted from all the languages that came before it. But it will take decades before well even be able to make a reasonable guess as to whether its a 100-year language or just the latest Aimee Mann record. If you were betting on music that will still be appreciated for its beauty 100 years from now, would you bet on Bach or Mann? And if you were betting on a computer language that would still be used in 20 years (lets try to keep the ratios reasonable), would you bet on Lisp or Croma?

Not really. My argument said that if you make a couple of reasonable assumptions, then music is almost certainly getting better. What are the reasonable assumptions that lead to old stuff being good? I doubt there are any, since we do so much old stuff which is so stupid simply because its old.
 
Lisp is not a bad example, in that its proponents dont seem to have examined many newer languages and their arguments fall down upon inspection.

Replace music with language, culture, design or fashion and you could make the same argument (but with one or more of them it might seem absurd).
 
Its not fair to totally discount the staying power of some music just because there are some traditional things that stay around even though they are stupid.

The reasonable assumption that leads to old stuff being good is simple: survival of the fittest.  There must be untold millions of melodies that havent survived to the present day, or if so are buried in archives.  If any of them were really really good, dont you think theyd still be well known?  Conversely, its a fair assumption that thoese works that have survived and managed to keep peoples attention for a few hundred years are likely to be pretty good.

PJ, survival of the fittest is a tautology. Who survives? The fittest. Who are the fittest? Those that survive. In reality, who survives involves a great deal of randomness.
 
In any event, the fact that Bachs music survived while that of his contemporaries didnt may mean that Bachs music was better, but I dont see how it can mean that its better than todays music, which hasnt exactly died out yet.

Theres good & bad music in all categories. One thing I like about Bach is his experimentation with themes & recursion - have you read Godel, Escher, Bach? Hell often take one theme, transpose it, reverse it and completely explore it.
 
What I like most in music is originality & a unique sound, as opposed to sound-alike pop singers. Most interesting music comes from indie artists & unsigned bands, since the big music companies are afraid to take a chance on something new.
 
Matt mentioned Mogway; the Icelandic band Sigur Ros is similar but more experimental. Their lead guitarist often plays his guitar with a violin bow and most of their vocals are in an invented language. The resulting sound makes me think of Icelands stark landscape.
 
Gogol Bordello is another group I like. They combine Eastern European gypsy music with punk rock.
 
I also enjoy Indian, Arabic & African music. My current favorite album is Orientation by Senegalese singer Thione Seck. He has a beautiful voice & combines Indian, Arabic & Senegalese styles in that one album. In fact Im listening to it now.

All art is subjective
 
Ones musical tastes change over the years for sure. I couldnt stay up through a classical concert until I was in my late 20s..then I woke up one day and found it beautiful. Not all of it of course, but a lot.
 
Also, about the old people theory: if you go to a one of the BBC Proms concerts for example, which are filled with people of all generations, that particular theory would go right out the window.
 
Its the fault of the musical organization that their marketing can only reach a certain demographic. I think in the US in particular, with the possible exception of cities like NY, most classical music organizations only orient their marketing efforts to people with certain incomes.

Aaron, your evolution argument has a model which is very appealing, but also known to be simplistic (Musicians will listen to old music, the majority of them will enjoy the good songs of the past, and theyll try to build upon and improve that good material, following its patterns, creating even better music. And the next generation will do the same, from a further along starting point.)
 
That says: There is a simple path, from lesser to greater, and we are progressing along it.
 
This is extremely attractive, it SOUNDS good. But its well-known to be highly misleading in many ways, some evolutionary biologists dislike it (do I have to dig up the Steven J. Gould reference, look for evolutionary bush).
 
Basically, the assumption IS the argument, so theres not a whole lot to debate.

Umm, no. Imagine the space of music, simplified, as a three-dimensional space, with each song as a point. All Im saying is that over time, the songs have increased x-values. Theres nothing about a path in there or progression.

Lets look at your assumptions, then:
 
For 1, you dont really offer any evidence (in fact, your story is a good counterexample as many people appreciate Bach yet you did not).
 
2 is probably more reasonable, although I dont see that some nebulous shared sense of music appreciation necessarily implies it.
 
3 requires that the objective standards of music depict an ideal form that could be approached.
 
4 seems to be the modern myth of inevitable progress.
 
 but if youre going to use hand-wavy reasonable assumptions to make your argument, I dont see why you would object to me using similarly hand-wavy counter-arguments ;-)

2 and 3 are conclusions, not assumptions. 4 is a conclusion from a premise you left out (music appreciation has a logical structure). Furthermore, 1 is simply posited as a possibility, I explicitly say I cant prove it.
 
I dont see why getting better requires an ideal form.

The assumption in 2 is that it is implied by 1.
 
Even if we accept 1, it doesnt necessarily imply 2.
 
The assumption in 3 is that the existence of objective standards implies an ability for music to get better.
 
Im not sure how you can avoid an ideal form (any music that meets your objective standards would be the best possible music, and thus ideal).

Classical music is not limited to Bach. Aaron, if you find Bach boring, you should check out Shostakovich. I cant guarantee you will like his music, but it is very different in many ways from Bach while still being under the classical umbrella.
 
Also, theres the difference between the easy to listen to music and good music that can be appreciated by all. This kind of reminds me of Paul Grahams essay on LISP and the Jane Austen comparison.

Better is perhaps not the word to use, since (as several note) it implies that there is a scale and getting better implies moving in the direction from the not good to the good end of that scale. (Better is a comparative, after all.)
 
Music has certainly gotten more diverse in several dimensions. We have a greater variety of instruments (while still largely retaining those of previous centuries) and better technology for every aspect of music making. Modern pop music synthesizes the influences from a variety of sources, including (esp. important in American music) other cultures and musical traditions. For example, Bach and Mozart did not use a blues scale, although its interesting to contemplate what they might have made of it. Contemporary music uses rhythms, scales, and harmonies that were simply not used in earlier times, at least not all in one place. (Some harmonies, such as the infamous tritone, were banished outright in ecclesiastical music.)
 
I suppose you could say that music is better in that someone who makes music has a much richer set of tools (musical and technical) to work with.
 
Classical music survives for the same reason that classic literature does  not because it appeals to popular taste, but because culturally it is considered high art, representing an exemplar of artistic achievement. Good classical music can pull off the trick of appealing both to the emotion and the intellect, and the best can do this even for the novice listener. (Crafters of popular songs have often swiped melodies from the classics.) Few people would argue that the Goldberg variations or the Titan Symphony are not more sophisticated than a three-minute pop song in structure, melodic and harmonic elements, and in the musicality required to perform them. As people learn more about crafting music, they generally find that the classics are respected for good reason. This is familiar to us from, say, Shakespeare, whose plays, while requiring more work to understand than an episode of Seinfeld, are rewarding to scholars and audiences alike.
 
Classical music survives, again like classic literature, because it manages from generation to generation to find new listeners. The audience is not large in comparison to that for pop music, but people from many cultures continue to listen to Bach and Beethoven and Brahms hundreds of years after their works were composed, suggesting that there is something universally appealing about these works. Pop music often appeals primarily to the generation that created it, often because it has emotional overtones that are not apparent to listeners from other generations. (It will be interesting to see whether recording technology will help popular music expand its reach to following generations; the fact that music from the 30s and 40s has a small but enthusiastic audience is a good sign.)
 
Someone earlier proposed that classical-music audiences are predominantly made up of older folks because those people were raised with the idea that appreciation of classical music was something to aspire to to be thought of as a cultured person. Thats probably true. Its not necessarily untrue today  in the types of social circles frequented by the movers and shakers, its still considered a mark of sophistication to be familiar with the great arts, including classical music. (Who else would ever underwrite opera? Not us peons.)
 
Whether the people who make up this audience actually have a sophisticated understanding of the music  or its performance  is open to question, of course. But the same can be said of jazz audiences. In a couple of ways, jazz is the inheritor of the musicality of the classical composers, who were all outstanding improvisers and who, like jazz players, frequently worked by taking a comparatively simple melody and exploring what they could do with it. Its a bit unfortunate that classical music has become fossilized into the performance of very precisely transcribed pieces; it would be very interesting indeed to be able to hear recordings of how the composers themselves played their music, and to see whether they embellished and improvised as the mood struck them. Pop music likewise opens the door to improvisation, although it differs from jazz in that in jazz, the focus is primarily improvisation, with the tune merely providing the framework.
 
Anyway, classical music will certainly survive; there will always be a small audience for its particular charms. It does not compete (nor should it) with popular music, and its narrow-minded to dismiss the one or the other (the one doesnt like as much) as unsophisticated or dead or whatever. Like music itself, musical appreciation can expand to encompass all styles without necessarily losing anything in the process.

Interesting observation that Bachs continued popularity may have been accidental.  In his day, Bach was not really popular, since the sort of music he composed emanated from churches and royal courts.  While Mozart respected Bach as a master, Bach was largely forgotten during the classical period following his death (what I think of as the Dark Ages). It was only during the 19th century that he became popular in the current sense.  Still, once the virtues of his compositions were rediscovered, it was no accident they became popular; it was based on sound, deliberate critical judgement and feedback from an ever-widening audience.
 
Too bad, you probably attended a poor performance. Not my favorite work, either. Still, Im particularly surprised because Bach tends to appeal to those with a mathematical bent.  I dont get a sense here how much Classical youve listened to to arrive at this damning judgement.  Its a rather bogus genre that covers an impossibly wide range of styles, from Palestrina to Ligeti (who died a few days ago). Still, Ill recommend a few alternative works: the opening chorale to the St. Matthew Passion; the Brandenberg Concerti (which, performed on period instruments, sounds as raucous as a rock band); the solo cello sonatas; for sheer playfulness, the Goldberg Variations (later Gould performance if you must hear it on piano).
 
(P.S., I actually think Aimee peaked with Im With Stupid, and has been increasingly formulaic ever since. Like you say, it occupies my brain for just a while.)

Your writing is increasingly disappointing. One of the reasons Paul Grahams essays are a better read is that he screens them through a cadre of friends and editors before he posts them. You might want to consider doing the same.
 
So why do old people like classical music? You might want to set up a poll and ask them. Who are you considering old? Were the people at the Bach concert you had an ADD meltdown in 180 years old? A 60 year old person was 25 in 1970. They probably dont remember the olden days when people listened to Bach on the victrola.

There is a variety of things you fail to even dismiss. We listen to recordings of contemporary music, but only to interpretations of classical music. A mention of the transformative force of recording on the evolution of music is total absent from your essay, as is a treatment of what it means for attempts to compare classical and contemporary music.
 
Further, if we assume that that simply because there were far fewer people back then and relatively far fewer could afford to dedicate their life to music, far less music was being composed at all. If that is a reasonable assumption, then its almost inevitable that the bell curve of the quality of new music is widening and flattening rapidly. Is this a reasonable explanation of the fact that music from a few centuries ago survived for centuries but music from today fades into obscurity within orders of magnitude shorter timeframes? You didnt think to consider any of this.
 
Lastly, you mention that survival of the fittest is relatively random, and there is definitely truth to that. On that basis, you could question the previous paragraph. It could also lead to questioning your conclusion that music is getting better, because from this assumption follows that you have no idea what the best music of the past was. How would we know that the truly brilliant music of the time isnt simply lost in time? If we dont, can we draw any conclusions about progress?
 
In summary, consider me unconvinced.

Im 30 right now - probably old as far as youre concerned.  Ive enjoyed classical music since my early 20s though.
 
You might want to try some Prokofiev, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, or Mussorgsky if Bach bores you (fwiw, I find Bach awfully dull too).  If you want something to really move you, try Elgars Cello concerto (better still, watch the movie Hilary and Jackie).
 
Classical music probably isnt for everyone though.  My non-classical tastes are often far from the mainstream too (Plaid, Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin, Ravi Shankar)
 
And thats fine.  Music is deeply personal.  It would be a dull world indeed if we all liked the same tunes.

Is this simply a flaw in my perception or has music really improved?
 
Its not the music, its you.  Did you consider that perhaps a pianist performing with the chicago symphony is not likely to be flubbing lots of notes?  No, of course not. It sounds wrong to you - obviously that stupid pianist doesnt know what hes doing.
 
Perhaps youre assuming that because music is composed of sounds, and hey, you can hear sounds, that you are therefore equally well-prepared to appreciate all music.  Well, you probably arent.  If you studied classical music, youd probably develop an appreciation for it.  You might still not like Bach, but at the very least I bet you wouldnt find it boring.
 
Do you really want to be the type of person who tries something once, doesnt get it, and then pronounces it boring?  You remind me of people who say golf isnt a sport, having no earthly idea how hard it is to drive a golf ball in a straight line.
 
IOW, there are no uninteresting subjects, there are only uninterested people.

I like your blog, for what its worth.  In any case, you seem frustrated that music isnt universally understood or appreciated despite the genetic similarity between authors and listeners.  But that doesnt take into account cultural factors, such as language and the meanings we attach to symbols.  Sure, Chomsky demonstrated that all languages are composed of essentially the same stuff, but that doesnt mean I can begin to appreciate a Russian poem without knowing Russian, to use an extreme example.  Some symbols dont need a lot of explanation (e.g. a smile on a face or the sound of a baby crying).  But that doesnt mean, for example, a pop song cant more eloquently communicate a topical idea between a group of teenagers than, say, Bach.

Aaron: In any event, the fact that Bachs music survived while that of his contemporaries didnt may mean that Bachs music was better, but I dont see how it can mean that its better than todays music, which hasnt exactly died out yet.
 
Me: One can argue that it is likely to be better, as it is a statistical fact that on average great works endure more than mediocre works.
 
Personally, I think that the fact that any idiot can learn 3 chords and sing out of tune, yet still be the popular music darling of the month or year is the best argument. You didnt say how your reasoning does not lead to the conclusion that Brittney Spears is better than Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven combined. Real musicianship takes 10 years to develop, if youre talented. That rules out a large part of popular music.

Something about Erics earlier comment bothered me: Part of listening to classical music is taking the time to understand and internalize the structures within which the composers were working, to understand the societal context they lived in.
 
Its fair to point out that we may have to work harder to appreciate the musical forms Bach worked with, as opposed to the sort of simple 12-bar blues or AABA structure that we hear so much of today. Still, Id caution that this is music appreciation, which is not the same thing as music enjoyment.
 
E.g.: while you may enjoy knowing that the second movement of a baroque concerto will be slow, its not necessary to enjoy it. The same is true of Bachs use of inversions and what-not that Mike Cohen mentioned. Whats important is not that a lot of this seemingly profound music consists of little musical hacks, but that we perceive the result as profound.
 
The idea that we have to more fully appreciate a certain kind of music in order to enjoy it has a certain circularity to it, and at any rate cuts both ways. As a silly example, imagine a classical music lover dismissing a pop song he hears on the radio as absolute tripe. A pop music fan might respond that he doesnt appreciate the fact that it features two of the most influential songwriting talents of the last several decades: Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder. When we learn to appreciate such matters, we incorporate a lot of subtextual information into the experience of enjoying a work that has little to do with its substance.

Generally one doesnt have to say what their reasoning doesnt conclude, but here goes. I was only saying that musicians could build and improve upon the past, I wasnt saying that all would. I also never said that everyone would listen to or appreciate the better music (since the radio could prevent them from being exposed to it, etc.).

True enough, one doesnt have to, but if the reasoning one uses can be used just as easily for conclusions that one wouldnt abide by, its a sign that the reasoning is incomplete at best, and flat out wrong at worst.
 
Regarding your clarification, that you were only saying musicians could build and improve upon the past: I can just as easily (and justifiably [meaning hardly at all]) argue that its possible that musicians cannot build and improve upon the past. I could equally posit that appreciation of music and talent for making music is an evolutionary adaptation, and thus that on the timescales of hundreds of years, it is exactly the same now as it was in 1685. Check back in 5,000 years, maybe, or 30 years if artificial augmentation of human intelligence happens in the near future.
 
Having more knowledge of the past as a consequence of living at a later time is a very different thing than actual improvement, which is what you are suggesting.  Knowledge does not imply skill.
 
What goes for music goes for many other things too, as others have noted. Your argument, as applied to literature, is essentially, its possible that writers could build and improve upon the past, and so the writers of today must be better than the writers of Shakespeares day. It could also be applied to just a subset of the population at each time in history, in which case it is certain that the best writers of today must be the best writers who have ever existed, which is plainly absurd. Not because the past is obviously better, but because there are so many past works of such rare levels of skill that it just isnt plausible that todays works (which I do read) are distinctly better.
 
I guess art todays art must also be better too?
 
On a parenthetical note, its rather silly to go to such lengths to say that something is merely possible. You clearly want to show more than that its possible, but I think you are aware of how much hand-waving youve had to do that you take the easy-out of saying I only want to show that its possible Im right.
 
Creationists might say that they are only trying to show that its possible that the world was created by God in 7 days, some 6000 years ago or so, and all the evidence to the contrary was put there by the devil in order to deceive us. To which most reasonable people respond that if all you can say is that its possible that what you believe might actually be true, youre not really saying anything at all.

An aside: was it a performance of the whole of The Well-Tempered Clavier, or just a selection? Because Bach wrote two volumes titled The Well-Tempered Clavier and each of them contains 48 pieces. And besides, all the pieces were originally written for a single clavier (keyboard), so to render it with an orchestra would require some re-arrangement.

Interesting thoughts. Its been my experience that you have to sort of learn to listen to music, train your ear. I assume that youve listened to contemporary music most of your life and very little, if any, classical music. So naturally when you listen to The Forgotten Arm it deeply resonates with the music thats in you.
 
Ive gone through several genres of music that all made me cringe in the beginning: jazz, metal, classical music, reggae, and so on. I find that when you start listening to a new genre, you have to find an entrance: a piece of music that resonates with the music youve been listened to and enjoyed. Once youve found that piece of music, you can explore the genre even further by finding music that resonates with that piece, and so on. Youll go from cringing to being able to determine whats great, good, averange and bad within that genre. Youll listen to its music and it will take your heart in its hands and play with it as it pleases.
 
Actually some of the records I love the most today took me years to discover like that. I remember listening to Van Morrisons classic Astral Weeks for a year, somehow sensing something amazing, but at the same time having a hard time listening to it. Then suddenly one day I put it on and it touched me profoundly. And it still touches me like that.

To wit, about Simon Carstensens point, an excerpt from Surely Youre Joking, Mr. Feynman:
 
The summer after the drawing class I was in Italy for a science conference and I thought Id like to see the Sistine Chapel. I got there very early in the morning, bought my ticket before anybody else, and ran up the stairs as soon as the place opened. I therefore had the unusual pleasure of looking at the whole chapel for a moment, in silent awe, before anybody else came in.
 
Soon the tourists came, and there were crowds of people milling around, talking different languages, pointing at this and that. Im walking around, looking at the ceiling for a while. Then my eye came down a little bit and I saw some big, framed pictures, and I thought, Gee! I never knew about these!
 
Unfortunately Id left my guidebook at the hotel, but I thought to myself, I know why these panels arent famous; they arent any good. But then I looked at another one, and I said, Wow! Thats a good one. I looked at the others. Thats good too, so is that one, but that ones lousy. I had never heard of these panels, but I decided that they were all good except for two.
 
I went into a place called the Sala de Raphael  the Raphael Room  and I noticed the same phenomenon. I thought to myself, Raphael is irregular. He doesnt always succeed. Sometimes hes very good. Sometimes its just junk.
 
When I got back to my hotel, I looked at the guidebook. In the part about the Sistine Chapel: Below the paintings by Michelangelo there are fourteen panels by Botticelli, Perugino  all these great artists  and two by So-and-so, which are of no significance. This was a terrific excitement to me, that I also could tell the difference between a beautiful work of art and one thats not, without being able to define it. As a scientist you always think you know what youre doing, so you tend to distrust the artist who says, Its great, or Its no good, and then is not able to explain to you why, as Jerry did with those drawings I took him. But here I was, sunk: I could do it too!

Its very interesting that such a long discussion has been precipitated by someone who obviously has no understanding of how to interpret serious music.  And music is developingperhaps you could listen to some modern composers before you draw your conclusions.  If only the uninitiated could perhaps try to look at something later than Bach before drawing their conclusionsthere are a few people who have devoted their lives to serious music since the 1700s!  Are you unmoved by Bach?  Perhaps you could try Beethoven, Mahler, Ravel, Poulenc, Rachmaninov, Scriabin

Perhaps the difficulty of the Well-Tempered Clavier lies with the fugue form.

I grew up playing piano.  I was drawn to what I thought were neat sounding patterns that my father played.  He was capable in all styles, but as a kid, I remember being particularly captivated by several Bach fugues and one of Mozarts sonatas.  These tunes interested me enough to want to learn to play piano on my own, and I did.  I now perform all styles of music proficiently.
 
Nevertheless, often I have had the experience you have described.  Ive had it with classical, and Ive had it with jazz.  Ive had a particularly difficult time becoming accustomed to classic rock, country, and even blues.  I now enjoy playing all these styles, but my mood will dictate my favorites.
 
Sometimes I really like Trent Reznor.  Other times I just cant get into him.  Sometimes I wake up humming Debussy, perhaps after not caring to think of him for weeks.  Since I know that my mood is variable, and it governs to a great extent my appreciation for music, I always give something new at least 3 chances before declaring a distaste for it.  Ive stumbled across many all-time favorites after an initial lack of interest.
 
I never thought Jimi Hendrix was anything special until I began to understand that nobody played like that before him.  Now everybody copies his style, but thats not equivalent to creating it.  Likewise, I have learned to appreciate many classical pieces by considering the overall contribution of innovation by the composer.  Today we must fight to tune out the constant noise of music playing in the background wherever we go.  We take for granted today what took many years to form.  Music evolved in a sense.  Its not an entirely separate evolution from our own either, and thats a fascinating idea alone.
 
It is enlightening to consider our biological origins, or our technological breakthroughs of the past.  And hey, the Pythagorean theorem sure isnt anything groundbreaking today, but it was at one point in time.  I try to imagine myself sometimes in the moment of these innovations, and it helps me to understand better what all the fuss could be about.

OOps. Let me finish. As an oldster I can tell you that people over 40 nearly always loose some hearing in the upper ranges. Life experiences also intervene to move around our mental and emotional furniture. As a result, tastes simply change. Bob Dylon still resonates for me, bringing back the thoughts and feelings of my youth. Some new music resonates for me. Much doesnt. I find some classical music, baroque comes to mind, soothing and mentally freeing. Though Im in no way a classical music afficionado, I enjoy some of it. I also enjoy some jazz. Enjoyment of music is such a highly personal thing, Id be reluctant to brush anything aside lightly that people have been listening to for centuries. Wait. Listen again at some future point. You may find the intervening years have brought you a fresh perspective - one you never could have anticipated. It is all part of the adventure, and is it ever fun!

As humans, we clearly share a number of genetically-encoded similarities, perhaps with some variation. For example, we almost all have two eyes, although in different shapes, sizes, and colors. Imagine that we are similarly endowed with some shared sense of musical appreciation (or, put another way, emotional susceptibility). We all fall for the same musical things, again with some variation.
 
If this is the case (and while I cant really prove it, it seems at least plausible to me that it is), then there would indeed be objective standards for measuring music
 
Are you familiar with the work of Ray Jackendoff? Jackendoff has been trying to approach music as a cognitive science (he is a Linguist but his research has often leaked to other areas of cognition).

Aaron, I am sure even Aimee Mann or Britney Spears are standing on the shoulders of giants like Mozart and Bach. They may or may not know itbut all music today is a mutation(as in genetic mutation) from classical music. Of course, some of the genes are introduced from Africa, Asia Pacific, Middle East etc. You cant (fairly) dismiss or diss the genes and still like the result. For instance, many of us are the result of intermarriages between settlers, immigrants and such. Tiger Woods or Keanu Reeves will not appreciate being told that you are OK with part of their genes, but dont appreciate the rest.

Everyone have a different perception of the same music because we are all different, have our own experience, education and projection about things. And its the same about musicians, the same piece is played differently depending of the musician and can fits what you want from music to be.
 
The music can be new because of the time it was written or because of the time you discovered it.
 
Some people like things because its everywhere and everyone are used to, like fast food. But others like more subtle taste and take time to develop and experiment with.
 
We can qualify music from an emotive, intellectual, formal or any other point of view But at the end, things are We are trying to give them values, qualities or a meaning.

At the risk of offending you with Shakespeare, read this quote from Merchant of Venice. T dont think there is a right or wrong answer for Jessica/Lorenzo.

Dude your argument is complete wack. First of all there is no way you put music appreciation into objective standards based on our genes. Music appreciation has to do with the way the brain develops, the electrical connections one makes.
 
That being said it is so very easy to understand popular music. It easy to understand its melodies and rhythyms on the first hearing. One, becuase pop music resonates with you because youve heard it all your life, and a lot of it is very entertaining/stimulating at a simple level.
 
However Classical Music is not as easy to understand. A began listening to music of the classical period when I started playing easy sonatinas in elementary school. I loved it, I progressed to mozart symphonies, and then to Bachs Brandenburg Concertos, and on to other fine baroque and classical works. My liking of classical music progressed slowly. I finally picked up some modern tastes when I started playing Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue. Now I listen to a ton of different classsical music such as Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, Grofe, Ravel, many baroque and classical artists and such.
 
When one listens to a piece for the first time they may not fully understand it. There is classical music I dont understand right now. I am slowly advancing the connections in my brain to enjoy a greater spectrum of classical music. I have a theory Before I listened to much modern classical music I didnt like it at all. I went to a symphony performance of Ravels Concerto in G and it went right by me. But later I downloaded a copy of it and listened to it many many times, and slowly I understood this wonderful piece the melody that I had completely missed the first time. There are many other instances like this one, but my point is that to understand classical music you have to take the time to make the electrical connections in your brain so that your brain will understand it. Mozart is very easy to understand at first, and then baroque, and then you can progress on to whatever you like, but it takes time and lots of listening to acquire the taste, however it is much much more rewarding than any pop music could ever be.
 
Did I like iced tea the first time I tried it? No! But I kept drinking it untill I understood it and now it my favorite most mind refreshing cleasing drinks.
 
Pop music is very easy to understand, and for me it has no depth.
 
Only classical music has been shown to have such profound effects on the brain, mood, and so many other amazing things. This refers to classical music of the classical period. Pop music could never achieve the same because it doesnt make the brain work, it lacks complexity.
 
For those who do enjoy it, through understanding inside the brain, it is a deep gold mine, that will produce more enjoyable moments than any pop songs.
 
Second of all, I think you are seriously underestimating the popularity of classical music. On Rhapsody music downloads, Bach is the 57th most downloaded, and classical music has a huge fanbase dude, not that you would know about it. Classical music has so many proven health benefits, so much scientific evidence behind its amazing what it does to the brain. and its not like people would listen to it because they want to improve their brain even though they hate the music.
 
Just because music is changing does not mean its progressing, in my opinin music is degressing, except for a few composers alive today.
 
The main point Im trying to make is that people dont like classical music because its harder to understand, and requires more patience, and simple pop music is very easily understood by the brain. It can be enjoyable but it no where near as enjoyable as understood classical msic..

Second, heh, wow if you did that you probably dont understand anything about classical musicsome people may play it well, some may not but if you hear a REAL artist like Martha Argerich, play say Beethovens fourth concerto, then the music wouldnt be just NOTES, it would be a story. That is real classical music, in my opinion, it is more profound that the modern musicalso you know people just dont appreciate classical music that much anymore thats really sad.

A lot of people who have commented on this article seem to think you have to study classical music to enjoy it.  I dont think this is true at all.  Give me any instrument, and I couldnt play Mary had a little lamb on it.  I still dont what it means that a piece of music is in a certain key, and to be frank, I dont really care.
 
In my experience, its all about repetition.  It is completely normal to not like a particular piece of music the first time you listen to it.  If you hate it the first time, listen to it again.  If you still dont particularly like the second time, listen to it a third time.  By the third time you will probably be able to at least appreciate it, and if you listen to it enough youll hopefully begin to really enjoy it or even love it.
 
When you listen to classical music, my advice to people would be to just concentrate on it - dont allow it to go into the background.  But I dont think you should try and analyse it at a theoretical level, unless youre interested in that sort of thing.  You should be able to appreciate it at an almost sub-concious level. I think thats probably the only way that you can really enjoy music anyway.
 
Another point that other people have made that other people have made, but I want to reiterate is that the term classical music encompasses I very wide range of music.  Theres probably a bigger gulf between Bach and the likes of Sibelius as there is between Rock and Hip Hop.  If you dont like a particular composer that doesnt mean you dont like all classical music.
 
The last point I want to make, is that a hell of a lot of classical music is very, very feel good. Even when it isnt feel good, it can be very exciting and even when it is depressing, it can be cathartic. Ive probably dervived more happiness from listening to classical music than from virtually any other activity.  I think its a shame that people dont listen to it simply because they are too impatient to give it a go and / or they dont think it fits with their image.  Who cares if old people listen to, that it has a snooty reputation, that it is too intellectual.  Just give it a proper go.

I thought i would post a few thoughts on this.i was awakened to how profound, how beautiful, classical music could be when i discovered the pathetique sonata by beethoven,  i then found much that uplifted me, that connected me with with something utterly new,i assimilated an identity with certain music that was breathtakingly wonderful and my attempts to realise or describe it outside the experience was like trying to catch an ocean in a cup.
 
This was virtually unprecedented for me, i had been listening to lots of popular music which i loved, which i found profoundly moving also.
 
such experiences were rare though and i questioned what relevance this music had for me. 
I think that balancing this issue between objectivity and what we respond to individually is so delicate. I think it is wrong to say that popular music has no depth, that it is simplistic, its just simply not the case if you love it, if it speaks to you, and i found classical music outwardly arcane and ostentatious, and i largely do still, and i identify deeply with popular culture and what it says to me and so i cant really find a place for classical or it seems largely to be absent from my music enjoyment. attempts to galvanise my taste for classical ended in frustration, the elation, the identification gradually waned. So i remain kind of unresolved with where i stand, i Dont think that music neccesarily gets better through time. Artists branch out, search for new ways to express themselves but the enjoyment comes down to preference thier really is no definite better music, that is just too crude anyway i enjoyed this page, keep posting views!

i agree with the post by the pianst. pop music relies more on studio production more than musical talent, and classical music is a bunch of people getting together and playing a musical piece in unison, something a synthesizer cannot replicate. but im not saying that pop music is bad either. im 19 years old but i have aprofound respect for musicians (of varying genres) and the unique abilities that one or many people can preform on an instrument. i listen to every type of music from rap to classical to jazz to blues to funk to rock to soul. you cannot say that music back then is not good because music refelcts times and situations. music may be better today because of technological advancements that can overdub sounds over sounds (e.g. Pink Floyds Dark side of the moon album; they had a recorder capable of holding up to 16 tracks which helped provide that spacey, elaborate sound) but you cannot disgrace the people who did not have such luxuries available to them. what about coltrane who only had the technology to record his solos on wax? what about the renaissance mandolin player who didnt have any technology at all? just because a particular genre doesnt capture your interest, doesnt mean you should say anyother one is better because all music is tied together, everyone learns from everyone, music evolves. people evolve. if it wasnt for that mandolin player then someone else might not have pick up a mandolin again. maybe if no one picked up a mandolin again then some great songs may have never been recorded. like Led Zeppelins Going to California with John Paul Jones mandolin that compliments Jimmy Pages guitar. it sounds earthly and beautiful. yeah its ok to say that classical music is not for me but if you liek any types of music then you should respect the one that came before; the ones who paved the way and inspired the bands/artists that you DO like.

Aaron, Maybe your music is boring, the same chords and the same BS rhythm over and over again,same lyrics over and over again. Man you truly must have no ear, because The Well Tempered clavier is one of the most well written pieces of music written to this day. Classical music isnt for old people, it is the most difficult to play, the most difficult to write and is certainly, therefore the most difficult to listen to. Simply stated, you shouldnt try to listen to classical music, as it may be too complex for your ear, you just arent ready for it yet. One day you will understand me. And frankly anything since the beatles on is so easy to play and write that I can train  a Chimpanzee to do so.

Id love to see you try to teach a chimpanzee to play something by Ludovico Einaudi. Hes a post Beatles composer,writing classical music for today.
 
Classical music isnt just about composers who wrote music 100s of years ago and died, it isnt about old people trying to make a point about the different genres of music around today. Its just another way of expressing life, experience and our world as it stood at the time.
 
Music samples from classical pieces are always being placed into modern dance, pop, and rap music, so quite frankly the poor sod who said classical music is only for old people probably wasnt aware that he too listens to classical music. Music is like literature, it can be traced back to the fathers who were doing it all for the first time. Writers like Chaucer and Shakespeare have influenced writing for generations after; its exactly the same with Beethoven & Mozart in music.
 
Artists such as William Orbit, Vangelis, Einaudi, Karl Jenkins, Mike Oldfield and loads more all take from those core composers. Even bands such as Nightwish, Cradle of Filth, Lacuna Coil and Within Temptation have wonderful elements of classical music that take their sounds to new heights.
 
And is this person not aware that advertising also deeply relies on classical music to sell their products? Car adverts, perfume, anything. Even the jingles played on the radio will be instantly reconisable because they are from classical pieces of music. Classical is important because it was the beginings of music as an escape, as enjoyment and entertainment.
 
Furthermore, whoever said that it has been proven that classical music is good for you and everything else is bad for you is referring to something called the Mozart effect. This was a piece of psychological research conducted a while ago that shows increased cognitive abilities for some people after listening to a certain piece of Mozart. This increase in cognitive ability is relatively small and lasts at most for 10 minutes. There is absolutely no proof that other types of music are bad for you, it just happens that for some reason that piece of Mozart raises our ability to complete certain conitive tasks for a little while.
 
To conclude, music is music. It has the same roots, it reflects us as human beings. With such wide variation within genres no-one can turn their noses up at one genre mainly because no-one can listen to everything that has ever been written. Dont be so narrow minded to conclude that classical music is for the elderly when todays modern music is clearly influenced by it. Honestlyhow silly!

To those of you who consider classical music outdated and boring, you might consider this:  There had to be a beginning for everything. Classical music was the beginning of every different music you hear today. It is just like Shakespeare, and Dickens, Defoe, Bronte, and others are considered classical writers. They started it without out them, we wouldnt have developed the written word nearly as much today. It is the same with classical music/musicians - without them, no other style of music would exsist.

I would argue certainly pro classical music. I used to listen almost all kind of music, but classical style of music is the best what a human can create. Only deaf people think in opposit way.

Aaron,
 
I was at the same concert of a certain Chicago conductor playing the entire first book of the Well-Tempered Clavier by J.S. Bach.  I was 25 at the time and was with my friend who was 26.  We sat next to other people who were under the age of 30 but you are correct in saying the majority of the audience was old.  I am a classically trained pianist who happens to know the Well-Tempered Clavier extremely well (having performed selections from it on several occassions by memory) and you were right - the pianist did flub some notes but his timing was never off.  I also found the performance to be boring, the pianists interpretation was not well done and I suspect he was either ill-prepared or having an off-day as all performers do at times.  Further, as a performance piece, the WTC has a lot of issues.  First, it was never intended as a piece to play for thousands of listeners in a concert hall nor was it intended to be played from start to finish. Bachs orignal intention for composing this piece was to give his son (Wilhelm Friedmann Bach) instruction on keyboard technique as well as compositional method.  How do I know this? Because Bach wrote these reasons on the coverpage of the manuscript of the piece!The WTC is divided into two books/sets of 24 separate pieces called preludes and fugues.  Most modern performers pick selections from this massive work which can come off quite successful but two hours of constant preludes and fugues is very monotonous.  This monotony occurs for two reasons: 1. The piano itself has a homogenous tone which pianists have to constantly struggle to manipulate in order to keep things interesting. 2. The WTC presents 24 pieces written in basically the same two structures over and over again making the organization of the music very monotnous as well and further complicating the issue number 1. Both my friend and I are classically trained pianists with graduate degrees in music and we both agreed - the concert sucked. Sometimes performers can pull off performances of long, repetive pieces by keeping the audience engaged but this was not one of those times. Does this mean that Bach sucks? No. Does this mean that classical music sucks? No. Does this mean that music evolves to become better as time goes on? No. I will admit though that 90% of classical music is awful but then 90% of almost anything contrived by man is pure drivel.  We perpetuate the other 10% (and it could be less than that) because it is the stuff that exhibits the best in human craftsmanship not because of stupid traditions.  The WTC is an example of great craftsmanship but unfortunately it was poorly executed.

Nice thoughts.
 
If the purpose of music is to inspire and arouse emotion in the listener, then would the better music be whatever brings the emotion in its strongest form? Or rather, whatever directs the emotion most efficiently in the way it was intended? Though individual tastes and susceptibility are surely factors, the improvements upon classical music by modern music may be that the latter works toward the emotion more directly. Like many above me have rendered, classical music plays with your mind as well as your heart, in varying ratios as compared to modern music. Technically, modern music is no doubt more simple than the classical composers, though that is by no accord a bad thing. The greater works of each group does the same job in different ways. Assuming that the difference in ratios addressed earlier leaves neither path (direct vs. indirect) as the worse, perhaps the evolution in music isnt a change in worth but rather a change in method.

WOW! What a discussion! I just want to say that I like classical music a lot, but I couldnt really describe why I like it until now besides I just do.
 
My general idea of why I thought classical music and hardly any modern pop music was because of the sheer amount of skill it took to perform the music, how complex it was. I used to think I didnt like modern pop music because it was simpler, more repetitive and not really enjoyable.
 
So do I really enjoy classical music or just appreciate the fact that they work harder? Both, but Im hoping that doesnt make me sound like Classical music. Yay! and Britney Spears. Boo!
 
Im sorry, I wish I could make a deeper observation on Aarons raw thought, but I didnt want to blab about things I dont know.
 
To the few who have been replying back and forth, great job. Sharing this knowledge multiplies everyones knowledge in general and can make new, stronger viewpoints. Thank you very much.

If the evolution argument is to hold any water, ask a modern pop composer to write a fugue. Oh, you mean, pop composers dont know what a fugue is? Surely they must have learnt about it during counterpoint class? What, pop musicians are not taught counterpoint? What kind of musical education do they have? Oh, most pop musicians are not musically educated, and many of them cant even read a score?
 
Im not saying there is anything wrong with being a musician without proper training. But the argument that someone can be better than Bach without knowing even 5% of what Bach knew is ludicrous at best.

Title: Life in Suburbia: Land of Cliche
 
From my desk in my apartment in Cambridge, I see the green leaves of trees out the window and, when I step closer, winding streets with quirky shops and interesting people stretching out below them. From my desk in my old home in suburban Chicago, you see the same trees, but behind them is asphalt and McMansion and long twisting driveways.
 
No one here uses public transportation. The city does have a train station, but one gets the sense that its purpose is mostly decorative  train stations remind people of the imaginary small town life that suburbs attempt to imitate. To get out to your house, you instead drive down long stretches of drab gray highway, besotted by hideous billboards and lined with ugly office parks.
 
The weather is certainly nice. On most days, if you go for a walk its quite beautiful  as long as you keep your head pointed at the sky, where the bright green leaves interweave with the brilliant blue. But as soon as you look down there are SUVs driving the wealthy to their half-hidden palazzos  just enough visible to be bragging, just enough hidden to be private.
 
Whereas in Cambridge the ambitious try to fill their houses with books, in suburbia you go for art and interior decorating. The tasteless fill their houses with large marble staircases and glistening chandeliers; the more tasteful prefer bright white rooms accented with sculptures and pictures  specific enough not to be intellectual, but abstract enough to be art.
 
You came back here to raise a family, but you wouldnt even consider sending them to public school. Why would you, when theres a perfectly good private school just twenty minutes away? There the kids are white and wealthy. After all, how could they be anything else at these tuition prices? The school does give out scholarships, but only based on merit: interviews, teacher recommendations, examination results and current school records. The school is in the wealthiest zip code in America, surrounded by trees and houses, like everything else in suburbia.
 
The school is preparing for graduation. You see a slide show of those about to receive their diplomas, seen when theyre so young that the smiles leap off their faces. How could anything so precious be unhappy here, with everything in its right place? Afterwards the families mingle in the courtyards, surrounded by the gleaming metal of the newly-built extensions.
 
Not too far, another group of kids hides behind trees by the parking lot, protecting a cooler full of water balloons they use to pelt their fellow students as they try to reach their cars. One kid, his yellow country-club sweater tied around his neck, complimenting his finessed blond hair, hides behind a glass door,  fear visible in his eyes as he looks at his newly-purchased convertible and prays it wont get hit. (He bought it, the kids explain, to match his new girlfriend. Then they turn and pelt two girls walking by.)
 
Despite their brazen acts, the kids are quite afraid  afraid of getting caught. They hide at the sight of parents or teachers and they restrain themselves from hitting the head of schools daughter. But they neednt worry. Parents see right through the charade and laugh it off. Oh kids, oh kids and their water balloons. How delightful! they say to themselves as they scurry to their cars.
 
The kids were right to guard the parking lots; not only is suburbia unmanageable without a car, driving cars is a central part of the culture: what kind, at what age, and where to? The funny thing is that there simply arent that many places to go. Theres your house, and your friends, and the shops uptown or at the mall.
 
Not that theres much difference between the two anymore. The malls have become open-air and the town centers have become so desiccated that theyre little different, just chain shops surrounded by fake walkways to other chain shops. The difference, I suppose, is that in town centers no one uses the walkways  why bother when you can drive?
 
While the kids enjoy their eating and shopping, the mothers get down to business at the grocery store, a menagerie of food and drink and color. Huge carts are filled and paid for and then passed off to low-wage Mexicans, who load them in your car as you drive out of the parking lot.
 
In between the malls and downtown, even the fakery disappears and the raw commercialism that pervades the suburb is left naked, assuming its default form of ugly highway signs and strip malls, all in an almost nausea inducing gray, stretching out in all directions, leaving little escape.
 
Not all the people of the suburbs are cold and vicious as their surroundings. For the most part, theyre liberals, the kind who are deeply affected by the plight of the homeless as they head back to their minivan. A small sign at the menagerie of a grocery store draws attention to the plight of the hungry. No, you dont have to feed them; just feel bad: the sign advertises national hunger awareness day (sponsored, the web site says, by many prominent organizations  organizations like Macys, Southwest Airlines, and the Food Marketing Institute).
 
After all, this is the generation of the New Left. 25 miles south, Chicago was rocked by the 68 Democratic Convention, where kids charged the city while filmed by newscameras, before the Chicago police decided to start beating up on both. The suburbanites didnt participate, of course, but they watched it on the news and felt sympathy for their brethren and invited the indicted Chicago 7 up to give a talk.
 
The war is now Iraq, not Vietnam, and the protest is more muted. A sculpture in the town center draws attention to our dead servicemen, while old ladies occasionally stage protests with large signs. Now the antiestablishment kids have become establishment parents, Mayor Daleys of their own households, full of tensions no less visible than those which engulfed Chicago.
 
Son one plays music too loud for son two who insists that right this minute he needs to play a video game. And when these fighting factions are supposed to come together, as in a graduation, the tensions boil over, parents screeching at kids who scream at each other, dragged down to the car where they argue about which windows to open and settings for the AC, until, realizing that theyre all stuck there together, tensions cool down somewhat. Still, it doesnt seem like much fun for anyone.
 
At the graduation, everyone has a camera to immortalize this precious moment. They force everyone into straightening their rarely-worn suits and dresses and smiling in rarely-seen ways so that the camera can capture the moment, an instant of artifice, entirely yanked from time, its history completely erased so that the fake smiles may be preserved.
 
The graduation itself is a whole event of such artifice: the students are trained to walk down the aisles absurdly slowly (while the organist stretches Pomp and Circumstance far, far beyond the breaking point) so that every parent may get copious photos of them standing in the aisle. Once on stage they fake their love for teachers they hated only days ago, while dressed in fake costumes and standing in front of a fake set. The parents are given programs whose professional typography hides the normal disarray of school, makes them think this place is Professional.
 
Oh, the absurdity of it all: putting all that effort into making memories they wont remember of good times they never had.
 
But I guess thats suburbia  the fake coat of paint that lets you pretend your unhappy life is just as nice as everyone elses, even if it easily flakes off.

I find this post quite cliche, but perhaps this was indeed the intent (to portray suburban life as one big cliche). First, the reason many people move to suburbs is that the public schools are good and that the higher house price is justified by not having to pay private school tuition. Second, dont you think its rather, should I say, bigoted, to claim that there are no homes in suburbia full of books on the shelf? However, Im willing to grant that the Chicago suburbs differ from the Bay Area suburbs I grew up in: people move to the Bay Area suburbs to see something, such as economic oppportunity and for ability to do intelectually stimulating work; people move from an urban area to place like Chicago suburbs to escape something  so you may have a point.
 
The point about car dependence and hence a car culture does remain, since that is pretty much a definition of what a suburb is.

hm. what exactly are you talking about? I grew up in the city, and I can assure you, that while it is easier to walk somewhere to get an ice cream cone, city kids feel the same sense of nothing much to do no matter where they live. You still go to school, you go to your friends house, and you go to shops.
 
Regarding schools, you seem to be confused. People move to the suburbs because they have better public schools. People who live in Cambridge (or Manhattan, or San Francisco) send their kids to private school because the public schools suck.
 
You might want to re-examine the Land of Cliche you are currently living in. Cambridge, while a fun, interesting place for a moment, is the penultimate cliched yuppie college town. A city dominated and owned by the wealthiest university (or non profit of any kind) in the world. Everyone is working on their masters degree and hates the suburbs with a passion. Indeed, each $700,000 condo-ized triple decker is filled with books, but youll notice everyone owns the same books. A few Steven Pinker volumes, the required Manufacturing Consent, Wine for Dummies in order to appear more cultured. Left over textbooks from law, medical, or engineering school. Dave Eggers, DeLilio, David Foster Wallace. People talk about the same boring crap: Population Explosion, Global Warming, Will my Web Site Make Me Rich and Also Cure The Worlds Problems?  Whilst they may be from different parts of the country and have different backgrounds, the aspirations and attitude of everyone living in Cambridge is at least as homogeneous, if not more so, than your typical american suburb.

What youre really railing at here is the bourgeois middle class, an attack that has been voiced many times in the past.  The reality is that if you asked any person in history or geography if they would choose that suburban lifestyle over any other, they would all say yes.  This includes the life of kings or superstar athletes.  If you want to be king, you have to play political games so intricate and with such deadly consequences- your painful death- that an office job with a suburban lifestyle sounds so much better.  The same for superstar athletes and their grueling training schedule and uncertain occupational lifetimes.
 
What ends up coming out of this piece is a bunch of bile, for no good reason.  A lot of people around the world today would view that suburban lifestyle as idyllic.  (btw, a devastating summary of Cambridge by starkfist, much more interesting than the piece that spawned it.)

Ajay hits the nail on the had, I think (this, by the way, is the first anonymous poster, who pointed that people move to suburbs to attend good public schools and that its bigoted to argue that suburbanites never have books upon their shelves) - far too many people could only dream of a middle class, suburban lifestyle.
 
Its ironic also that so much discourse is now aimed against the middle class, largely since most of the opponents of capitalism realize that it is the middle class that sustains the system. The upper classes (e.g.: those who can afford to own a house in Cambridge, Palo Alto or San Francisco [ monthly rent on many an appartment in San Francisco is higher than the monthly mortgage payment on my parents suburban home]) have, amongs them, a large contingent of those who are the most ardently opposed to capitalism (Howard Zinn, for instance, owns a house next to the movie star Matt Damon; not that, mind you, this discredits any of his work, which has merit even if you disagree with his politics).

I have to agree with Starkfist and Ajay. When I lived in upstate NY, the people who lived in the city sent their kids to private schools, while those out in the suburban towns ringing the city had their kids in public school. Why? Because the suburban schools were much better than the urban ones.
 
As for SUVs, I am not a fan. However, Americans ini general drive cars (not just trucks) that consume a lot of gas. When I was in Cambridge last year, I saw a lot of high-end German sedans. Having been in the market for a new car, I can guarantee you that none of the luxury cars currently marketed in the States could be classified as frugal. As a matter of fact, most of the Bostonians that I know seem as car addicted as any suburbanite.

Unfortunately I dont know enough people in Cambridge to discuss it as starkfist suggests, although Id love to  it sounds really interesting. Im shocked to hear so many people have Steven Pinker books; I thought that was restrained to the real monsters. Id also be shocked if I ever saw anyone here with a copy of Manufacturing Consent. And I cant say Ive overheard anyone talk about population explosion.
 
In any event, I dont think I was criticizing the suburbs for homogoneity. I was more concerned about fakeness. The people Ive talked to about global warming here genuinely do seem to care about it, I get no sense that theyre pretending to so they can fit in (although perhaps Im just not sensitive enough to this crowd).

I wasnt attacking the middle class, I was attacking a middle class lifestyle, one I dont believe to be entirely freely chosen (and thus one cant criticize people for living it). The most recent anonymous poster may have a point about Palo Alto, but in Cambridge and San Francisco they have apartments and neighborhoods that allow much more variety in race and income than I saw in the suburbs.
 
The point about Zinn and Damon is completely absurd. Zinn lived next to Damon when Damon was growing up as a kid. Damon didnt have a single acting job until he graduated from Cambridges public high school, so its a bit unfair to say Zinn lived next to a movie star.

William Upski Wimsatt has a thoughtful and relatively positive look at the suburban situation.
It is a bit corny, but hes from Chicagoland, too, so it may resonate.
 
Regarding the Cambridge crowd, I think you havent had enough exposure. SUVs are gauche, but the most vocal about global warming would buy a Porsche or Mercedes provided they had the funds to do so.

Aaron, my bad for not reading the Wikipedia entry. Nonetheless, the place where Zinn lives - Newton, MA  from the demographic data seems to be just as wealthy as Palo Alto and less diverse. Second, you seem to think that Chomsky and his theories are somehow an exotic field that few people are exposed to: I dont know why youd have this idea  he is after all, the most frequently cited scholar. While I cant speak for other peoples universities, the university a person I tutored attended (major in a social science) recommended and assigned his political writing in multiple classes (as a computer science major, however, Ive only had his linguistics work discussed in class, but his political works were mentioned as well in a brief bibliography of him in one class I took); in addition, the English teacher in my suburban public high school, after 911 recommended that students read Chomsky (writing out his name on the board and everything). So Im sure in a college town everyone has at least heard of Chomskys political works and that it is certainly a theme of discussion at coctail parties and his books grace the shelf.
 
Lastly, middle class is not only defined by their earnings, but in part by their lifestyle (both working parents, owning their own house, owning two cars etc). Why do you also claim that lifestyle isnt freely choosen? Again, heres an example: my own parents dropped everything (their jobs, their government pensions, their university posts) to move to suburban United States. We also saved towards a house, rather than rent an appartement in a city for the same mortgage (but without a down payment). How is that not choosing it? What about the families that moved from the cities to the suburbs when cars/commuter rails became a possibility (it is the availability of cars and freeway system, as well as of commuter trains earlier in the century [first commuter suburbs sprung up in the late ninenteenth, early twenthieth century]  not racist motivations  that led to the exodus of middle class families from the cities to the subrban)?
 
I think the anti-middle class attitude is why Bush has won this election (there are still many predominantly liberal suburbs, such as the one Aaron has described, but all of the fastest growing counties have been voting republican in the last two elections). Some historians (Paul Johnson is one of them) have also argued that fascism was able to ride on this middle class backlash  against what they saw as sophisticated socialists  to power in Italy.

I find it hard to believe that the fakeness of putting all that effort into making memories they wont remember of good times they never had is confined to those living in the suburbs.  Fakeness in Cambridge?  Surely not!
 
Perhaps were acquainted with starkly different impressions of suburbia, but Ive found that suburban dwellers are most times equally if not more real than the urban dwellers you seem to esteem.  They are the 9-5ers and blue collar workers pushed to the edge of the city in order to afford a nice home.  They are the ones that work out in the yard while the kids pedal up and down the sleepy street.  They are the ones frequently hitching the boat and camper up to go enjoy their weekends with their family.
 
While I do not love all aspects of suburbia, I do admit it works (and works well) for some.

Aaron, while you think there may be better lifestyles, my point was that the suburban lifestyle is by far the one lifestyle that most people everywhere aspire to.  It is far ahead of any possible second choice for the most wanted lifestyle.
 
As for your point about fakeness or hypocrisy, it takes a great deal of thought, insight, and discipline to live a life that is even moderately consistent.  The point that starkfist and Nicole make is that you can find hypocrisy everywhere you look, as most people dont have the time or inclination to do more than assemble a pastiche of popular positions.  The people in the suburbs may be more blatant in their hypocrisy and the people in Cambridge may be more sophisticated in hiding theirs, but the fact remains that hypocrisy is an almost universal human condition, depending on how deep you want to dig.  Given that, it would be better if you chose one particular hypocritical position that is particularly harmful and explored its causes and implications, rather than focusing on trivial examples like fake smiles for graduation pictures or kids throwing water balloons.

Could you explain what you mean when you say people are lied to about the suburbs or that people dont freely choose a middle-class lifestyle?  I want to say that I dont much care for the suburban lifestyle myself, and I was raised there just like you.  But thats because I have other preferences and I realize that most people have preferences- lots of space, comfortable surroundings, the patina of nature that you mention- which dovetail into the suburban lifestyle.  I think that this lifestyle is very wasteful but I dont want to stop people from doing what they want to do (say by using government regulation), and thats the lifestyle most people want.  I would rather try to inform people why it is wasteful and let them make the decision for themselves.

I exempt the working class entirely from my comments.
 
Thats problem with drawing a single conclusion and trying to apply it across an entire category of people  it rarely works.  Though one thinks of suburbia as a vast wasteland of homogeneity, in reality, suburbia (across the US) is inhabited by people of many different cultural and financial backgrounds.  In some places, suburbia is the retreat of the rich.  In other places, its a destination where affordable housing is found.
 
I am curious though where I can find good sources of fakeness in Cambridge.
 
Youre kidding, right?  I suppose no Cambridge family has ever smiled perfunctorily through graduation pictures.

Ajay: Working class adoration? What are you talking about? I was referring to the massive propaganda programs designed to convince people that the cities were dangerous and the suburbs were safe and healthy, when the opposite is now the case. I hope to write about this someday, but not now, so details will have to wait.
 
Nicole: When did I draw a conclusion or try to apply it across an entire category of people? I was writing about my first-hand experience in the North Shore suburbs of Chicago, which are predominantly upper-middle class and well-known as fairly well-off. I guess the fact that I sometimes referred to it as suburbia instead of North Shore suburbs of Chicago might have been a little confusing, but thats what I meant.

Obviously, there is a discrepancy between your intent and how I interpreted it.  While I realized you were writing about your personal experiences, I also felt (which may be incorrect obviously) you were attempting to draw broad conclusions about suburbia in general from that experience.
 
Regardless, Im still not sure how you dont see fakeness in Cambridge.  Fakeness/hypocrisy is everywhere as Ajay much more eloquently notes (http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/suburbia#c16).

Your working class adoration refers to statements like I exempt the working class entirely from my comments and The real people who ought to be paid lots are the people doing the unfun but necessary grunt work that nobody really wants to work. But these are exactly the people that socialists propose to reward! (presumably the second quote refers to the working class).  According to the laws of supply and demand, there are people who work very hard and get paid very little (ditch-diggers) and there are people who work very hard and get paid a lot (professional athletes).  All that matters is how in-demand their skills are.  Perhaps you can explain why you adore the working class so much and why they deserve intervention to contravene this basic law?

There are fake people everywhere  certainly a lot in Cambridge.  I have lived in many countries, and grew up with scientists, including Nobel Prize laureates  no difference  fakeness abounds.
 
The distinguising feature of typical suburbia compared to Cambridge, for example, is the average IQ.  Less intellignet people are just less sophisticated in their fakeness.  They buy Hummers versus Mercedes.  They talk about soap operas versus new books, etc Everyone has to find their type of community and then ignore the fakeness.

Aaron:
 
Standing on the outside in judgement is easy easy to be glib, critical and arrogant. Regardless of which perspective one is advocating, it is still simply judgemental, critical arrogance. Thats why this post is such a clich. Makes no difference. Its bigotry and sterotyping from the liberal perspective.
 
Im a father of two girls ages 6 weeks and 2 years. We live in suburbia. Our kids will go to public school. We live a fairly modest life being one of the least affluent in our very affluent area (Main Line Philadelphia). From the outside Im sure you would lump us into the vacuous, inane, blah, blah, blah group. You would probably think our life is boring. Were not saving the world, were not wealthy and putting on airs, were middle class working people who are trying to have a life and raise two kids. Boring, nothing dramatic. Id say were fairly average Americans at least what I fantasize as being the big, quiet majority of us.
 
I think it is hard to be average. Its much easier to be downtrodden, angry and righteous or, on the flip side of the same coin, wealthy, arrogant, obnoxious and obvlivious (which is how I read how you have portrayed your fictional suburbia and which George W. captures perfectly).
 
Thats my point. You are just the flip side of the same coin. Youre the angry, righteous voice speaking up for the downtrodden innocent. Very dramatic. Very artistic. Very right. Youre about being right rather than making a difference any kind of difference.
 
Its much harder to be average and work hard to raise two kids. Its not flashy, its not Hollywood but its simple, real and we dont need to be angry and judgemental because we have real lives. This is the rest of American. What about us in the middle as you and your brethren on the far right lob stereotypes back and forth. What about us?

Ajay: Failing to make a statement about someone is hardly adoration and saying that people who do X deserve Y says very little about the people who actually do X. Supply and demand isnt a law of nature, its an artifact of our current economic system. Even if it was, whats in supply and whats in demand is constrained by law and politics. There are very few doctors in the US because protectionist programs make sure that only a couple people can become doctors and doctors cant be imported from other countries. Thus the supply of doctors is constrained and we have to pay more for them. The same isnt true for ditch-diggers, so the supply is very loose, and we get people from Mexico who will work very cheaply. One doesnt need to be in love to see this is unfair.

Lets look at your statements.  Its not that you failed to make a statement about the working class, as you describe it, its that you sweepingly exempt a whole group from relevant criticism, as Nicole stated, implying that they can do no wrong.  Saying that people who do X deserve Y says everything about what you think of the people who do X and what you think their true value is.
 
Supply and demand is in fact a law of nature: animal predator-prey populations follow a boom-bust cycle as each population swells or diminishes, based on the supply or demand of the other.  Attempting to constrain these cycles is an artifact of our current economic system, not the other way around.
 
You use two good examples of labor supply and demand, lets look at those.  I agree that the supply of doctors is artificially constrained but this is because of socialist programs that give them unprecedented power over who can practice.  Breaking this system up, perhaps by allowing multiple independent licensing bodies, is the way to fix this, not by following the socialistic principles you espouse that caused the problem in the first place.
 
As for the supply of ditch-diggers, I agree with you that, in principle, illegal immigrants shouldnt be allowed to come over and work illegally.  However, its more complicated than that.  Since practically anyone is physically capable of digging ditches, you cant keep people out by saying they dont have the requisite skills.  And its practically impossible to keep Mexicans out as their country is much poorer and there is such a huge border to police.  I would grant them some sort of intermediate status, similar to a guest worker program, where they have to be documented but are not allowed the full rights of citizens.
 
But these two examples dont have much to do with the principle I was talking about because even if you shut all the Mexicans out and made medical licensing much more competitive, professionals like lawyers would make much more than ditch-diggers because their job is harder and their skills are more in demand.  You fail to answer the basic question of why this should be subverted but bring up mostly irrelevant examples of labor supply with other constraints.

Ill put aside rather boring discussions about ways to interpret a sentence that I wrote and whether observations in animal populations can be generalized to laws of human nature. Instead, Ill attend to Ajays basic question: why I think ditch-diggers should be paid better.
 
Imagine, for a moment, that we start our economy over from a blank slate, erasing issues of pay, education, and parentage, and let people choose what professions they want to pursue. Given the choice, how many people do you think would say Id love to be a ditch-digger versus Id love to be a doctor. It seems fairly plain to me that there would be many future doctors and few future ditch-diggers. Being a doctor is noble, rewarding work and while no doubt digging ditches has its rewarding aspects, I just cant imagine it being as popular.
 
In such a scenario, under Ajays laws of supply and demand, wed have to pay the ditch diggers more to get enough people to take the job. But, of course, we dont. And if you agree with me so far, the difference must lie in the things I subtracted at the beginning: education and parentage. The education of doctors is carefully constrained, both in who and how many receive the education. Thus they have the power to demand high pay. In a truly free market, these restrictions would disappear, many more people would become doctors (including many who would otherwise dig ditches), and the pay of ditch diggers would go up in relative comparison.
 
That this doesnt happen tells you whos in favor of socialistic anti-market schemes.

Wow, that was quick.  Perhaps you should have thought about it some more because your thinking on this topic is characteristically sloppy.  One of the reasons you have less doctors that ditch-diggers (too long a name, Im calling them diggers from now on) is because it doesnt matter what someone says Id love to do, it matters how hard it is to do and how willing they are to put in the work.  Going through the training to be a doctor is much harder than digging, therefore there would never be more doctors.  Also, you dont know much about being a doctor because listening to sick people complaining all day long is as tedious as digging.  Doctors might try to assuage themselves by thinking theyre doing noble work and diggers might try to do the same by thinking theyre the salt of the earth, but the unpleasant nature of the work remains.
 
However, I agree with you that the supply of doctors is artificially constrained (on the other hand, your argument that in a free market there would be more doctors than diggers is ridiculous).  But your argument appears to be that since that particular market is artificially constrained by socialistic principles rendering it so shitty, lets apply those same socialist principles to all other markets?!!
 
And finally, you end on a glib note that doesnt even make any sense.  Who is it that your arguments tell you favor socialist schemes?  Ive argued against the artifial constraint of the supply of doctors since the beginning.

Ajay insists that all the people who want to be doctors would never make it through the training. He doesnt provide any evidence for this and I doubt he could, since over 90% of medical students make it through the training fine. Of course, the exact details of the number are fairly meaningless because the curriculum is manipulated to ensure the right number of doctors comes out the other end, but certainly there appears to be little barrier to most people making it through school.
 
And, no doubt, being a doctor is not fun  all the doctors I know complain about it. But lets do another thought experiment: imagine you presented them with the option to keep the same salary but spend their days digging ditches instead of being a doctor. Do you really think theyd take it? (This is the right comparison, since they dont see how hard it actually is until after theyve gone through medical school.)

As Ive said before, whether its fun or not is completely beside the point.  What matters is that a higher percentage of people would not be able to reach an adequate level of proficiency at being doctors than diggers.  As for medical school, I talked to a medical student recently who told me that even for a desired and highly-paid specialty like radiology, the hard part is getting in.  Once youre in, the work is easy.  Of course, this method is obvious if you examine the low selection rates for these schools and then the low attrition rates that Aaron notes.  The medical profession controls how many people enter the profession by only letting a few people in the door, not by kicking people out once theyre in.
 
The fact that you choose to highlight a misleading statistic like this and continue to sidetrack the question about socialism into one about how fun different professions are shows that you have no arguments to make.  Youre just making pedantic and misleading statements in the hope that people will be misled by them.

I think this ties in very well (or is atleast consistent) with Aarons piece about global warming. Suburbs are evilthey are the reason we have SUVs, high gas consumption, green house gases and global warming. 
I have lived for 2 years in Hong Kong and for a little while in New York. Public transportation, high rise apartments with efficient heating/cooling, easy access to parkswhat we need for our dwindling resources.
The point is not that big city dwellers like cars as much as suburbanites. Its that someone living in Manhattan can easily live without a carwhile a suburbanite usually does not have a choice. She has to commute, pick kids from soccer practice and such

Swartzs original post was cliched- but so are many things that are true, just by frequent repetition. George W. Bush is a bad president is cliched, but that doesnt mean it isnt true. (Or false, for that matter.)
 
People like Eric M, Ajay, and the fellow with the bit about Zinn and Damon miss the point. That most people prefer a Suburban existence is no argument for against it in relation to what is good. People like Eric M, who are not saving the world, average, and so on are vacuous and inane and boring.
 
Most people prefer to be that- fine. That doesnt invalidate a critique of it. As far as I see it, and I think Swartz sees it the same way, one ought to try to move beyond just getting by and living ones own ordinary life in the suburbs: one ought to try to make the most of human existence. Most people in suburbia arent doing that. Theres just not enough raw, diverse input, not enough genuine risk, for people to do that.

Seriously, do you like living in Suburbia? As if commuting to NWSL by car wasnt bad enough already, now theyre charging money for the privilege! Have you had enough yet?
 
After spending my entire first year in a house out in the suburbs, it drove me crazy to have to get in my car in order to get anywhere. From where I lived, only a few things were actually within walking distance. Everything else, like movie theaters or decent bars or parks or shopping districts, could only be reached by car. I felt guilty driving to school. I didnt want to pay the new parking fee. And getting home from social events in my car always required a ton of tedious planning (hi, officer!).
 
But theres a better option: live downtown, where all the fun stuff is!
 
Thats right! I moved into an apartment near the Portland State campus downtown, rented a parking space, and began taking the Pioneer Express to school. I love it!

While Aarons generalizations are a bit off-base, he does point out some sad truths about modern life in America.  But I think the glass if half full as opposed to being half empty.  Yes its true that commercialism and fakery exist in the suburbs but they are alive as well in the country and the city, too.  On the other hand,  good-hearted socially progressive and intellectual folks exist there, too.

Wow Aaron, I just discovered this blog and find that you completely miss the point.  Your are the definition of a spoiled brat.
 
Have you seen the world?  Have you seen what a sweat shop is like?  Its easy for you as MR. I made a few mil off Reddit to complain like this but all of the places you consider genuine such as Cambridge and San Francisco are just as fake if not more so than any suburb in America.
 
People care about things they can afford to care about.  Ive met plenty of people in major cities who only care about global warming because its a cool issue.  Its easy to say Oh I live in a city and use public transit, Im in favor of reducing gas consumption.  Great.
 
If you want your children to access a great education AND to live in a city, you have to have a lot of money so that you can afford extremely expensive real estate AND send your children to private school.
 
Its lost-in-the-cloud liberals like you that are responsible for the shambles our education system is in right now.  Many things need to be privatized so theres a monetary incentive for our next generation to get the education they deserve.

Aaron,
 
Interesting article, and the responses were lively. I have to say you can come across as arrogant and the debate did get sidetracked but I agree with your article and some of the comments you made defending your thesis were well put.
 
What lies at the centre of this debate is something I have personally been thinking about for a long time. The middle class seem satisfied with mediocrity. Getting by, 3 bedroom house, a few kids and an average managerial/professional job. Most people are happy with this. Or rather, think there is no other way to be. Or are just too damn scared to try anything else. For people like me and I assume Aaron, we hate this mediocrity, we want to genuinely contribute something, we do not want that average lifestyle, because for us, that is no life at all. It is, dare I say, an easy option.
 
Some people thrive on challenges, others dislike them. For me, I agree with Aaron because for me that lifestyle is EXACTLY what i do not want. Others may be happy with it. Within me, i feel those people have not lived. They think I am self-righteous and arrogant. I think they have been brainwashed.
 
The fundamental disagreement lies in our views of how we should live are lifes. I cannot tell people how to live their lifes. All I can do is offer what JS Mill said in On Liberty and offer verbal persuasion. That is where I think Aaron is coming from. In a similar way we may try and persuade someone to stop smoking.

In the future, I would recommend placing more emphasis on the effect this sort of thing has on the people within it (including yourself), and not just a view of whats there.
 
Providing some emotional context (i.e. admitting that there is an intuitive or even irrational element to your view) makes it a lot easier to take for people that dont already see it that way.  Youll be less likely to come off as arrogant, and it goes a long way to getting others to admit the irrational parts of their arguments, and a more reasonable dialogue comes out of that.
 
Without a little bit of uncertainty, people will read all sorts of things into your words.  For instance, people commonly have the notion that having an economic or political conviction requires you to actively hate a certain group of people.   Witness these comments, pointing at the American suburb and saying this sucks causes people to assume that you hate the inhabitants, think that you are superior, or wish to see them suffer for their sins.
 
None of the comments Ive read have questioned the existence of such a place  weve all been, if not to the North Shore, then places that bear an eerie resemblance.  Where there is not the same affluence, there is the aspiration.  Suburbia is exactly a land of clich: its a mass-produced illusion repeated ad nauseam throughout the US in startling uniformity.  Thats whats wrong with it.  It isnt the idea of the suburb (a middle ground between the town and the country)its the modern implementation, the automobile slumthe fact that you can go anywhere and its exactly the same.
 
I think in this piece you miss a chance to define what it means to be in a place like this.  Look at it one way, its depressing.  Another, its comforting.  Its a Necker cubeand I think its important to help people (including yourself) see it as one.  Two views of the same thing, and more importantly, lines on a page that can erased and redrawn.

====================================================
Date: June 15, 2006
 
Title: Fighting Back: Responses to the Mainstream Media
 
[This is part 7 of an article on the power of right-wing think tanks. See also part one, part two, part three, part four, part five, and part six.]
 
Unlike the conservative media, it does not appear the national media is intentionally partisan. But it exists in a very specific structural context. A recent study found that two-thirds of journalists thought bottom-line pressure was seriously hurting the quality of news coverage while around half reported their newsrooms had been cut. 75% of print and 85% of broadcast journalists agreed that too little attention is paid to complex issues. When youre short on staff and stories are shallow, reporters become even more dependent on outside sources  and the right-wing think tanks are more than willing to help out, while further pulling coverage to the right.
 
But one obvious solution  creating a matching set of left-wing think tanks  while perhaps helpful in balancing the debate, will not solve the problem. Media norms of balance mean that even qualified experts will always be presented as just one side of the story, balanced directly against inaccurate conservatives  recall how the handful of corporate-funded global warming deniers are still balanced against the overwhelming scientific consensus.
 
Ideally, viewers would be able to hear both perspectives and decide which they thought was accurate. But since, as the journalists conceded, so little time is spent explaining complex issues, in practice very little information is presented that can help the viewer decide whos correct. So theyre left to decide based on their existing ideological preferences, further splitting the country into two alternate realities.
 
Figuring out what is true  especially when its so obvious, as in the examples above  is precisely what the mainstream media should be doing. Partisan pundits would be replaced with thoughtful scholars. Non-peer-reviewed books would be ignored, not endlessly promoted. Scientific facts would be given precedence over political arguments. Political commentary would be replaced by factual education.
 
Dont hold your breath. Six major companies own nearly 90% of all media outlets. And they  and their advertisers  dont mind how things are going. Sumner Redstone, CEO of Viacom (Paramount, CBS, Blockbuster, MTV, Comedy Central, etc.), told a group of CEOs that I look at the election from whats good for Viacom. I vote for whats good for Viacom. And, from a Viacom standpoint, the election of a Republican administration is a better deal. Because the Republican administration has stood for many things we believe in, deregulation and so on. Better news reporting wouldnt just be more expensive, it would threaten these business interests.
 
To get the straight story, its necessary to turn to independent and community sources which dont have such conflicts of interest. One possibility is the daily news show Democracy Now!, hosted by Amy Goodman, which is funded only by viewers and foundations. Broadcast on 150 radio stations, 150 television stations, and the Internet, the show presents stories from activists, journalists, authors, and public interest organizations from around the world.
 
When outlets from ABC to the New York Times began claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, Democracy Now! was one of the few sources to take a contrary view. It presented the testimony of Iraqs top weapons official, who defected to the US and explained that all the weapons had been destroyed. (Other stations, ironically, parroted the Bush administration in promoting the information he presented about the weapons Iraq had, without mentioning they had been destroyed.)
 
And when US soldiers kidnapped Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the democratically-elected president of Haiti, and flew him to the Central African Republic where they locked him in a hotel room, he managed to quietly phone out while armed guards stood outside his door. Democracy Now! was alone in airing his incredible story. When Aristide was finally freed, he insisted on returning to his country and again Amy Goodman was the only US television journalist who dared to accompany him back.
 
Still, Democracy Now!s audience is rather small compared to that of the mainstream media. But stories from overseas hint at what could happen if enough people begun paying attention to such sources. In South Korea, the country with the highest rate of broadband adoption, politics has been turned upside down by OhmyNews, a five-year-old website. Founded by Oh Yeon Ho, OhymyNews has a feature unlike any other paper: more than 85% of its stories are contributed by readers.
 
Almost anyone can write for OhmyNews: the site posts 70% of all stories that are submitted, over 15,000 citizen-reporters have published stories. OhmyNews copyedits their work but tries to leave their differing styles intact. The citizen-reporters write about things they know about and that interest them, together they end up covering most of the traditional spectrum. Yet their new voices end up providing coverage on things which typically get ignored by the mainstream media.
 
This is most evident in their political coverage. Before OhmyNews, conservatives controlled 80% of Koreas newspaper circulation. Then OhmyNews gave a voice to progressives, inspiring massive nationwide protests against the government. The protests, in turn, led to the election of reformist Roh Moo Hyun, now known as the first Internet president. The furious conservative National Assembly responded by voting to impeach Roh on technical grounds. OhmyNews readers again organized and overthrew the Assembly in the next election, reinstating Roh. Theres no reason why what happened in South Korea cant happen here. Overcoming the tide of misinformation is hard work, but working together committed citizens can make amazing progress, even when up against the most powerful interests. Out society has an extraordinary level of freedom and openness. Whether we use that freedom to seek out the truth or remain content with conventional platitudes is up to us.

Two things strike me overall. First, the varying treatment given to the problems of Social Security and global warming. The former is a made-up crisis that doesnt require immediate action, while the latter is a genuine and pressing concern. But is the information on which to base a response to potential anthropogenic warming more complete than it is for SS?
 
Second, your series is based on the idea that an issue can become obscured after the terms of debate are shifted. I agree. Around the time of Bushs second inaugural, there was much bold talk of private retirement accounts and the ownership society as a superior alternative to Social Security. After that, the debate shifted to whether SS could be accurately characterized as being in crisis, how far in the future it would become insolvent, whether it would continue to pay out the expected level of benefits even then, and what combination of increased payroll taxes and reduced benefits would be required to keep the system in place. What happened? The debate shifted from what was best for people hoping to retire comfortably to what was the best way to sustain Social Security.

Lets say the information for social security is more complete. Then we can use that information to decide that SS isnt in crisis.
 
Theres a difference between a debate shifting because of partisan strategy and one shifting because of facts.

I think Aaron is on to something here.  I cannot rely on the media for important information anymore  not life or death kind of stuff.  And relying on the blogosphere is not that much better  it tends to just magnify the mud slinging.  I think what we need is a new process to get at what really matters.  Maybe something like:  blogosphere + rules of engagement -> consensus truth ?  I dont know  but reading both sides of the Global Warming contraversy is producing nasuea.  No wonder the media has shunned it in favor of simpler issues.

Im very interested in the possibility of the internet spawning the type of tool that Seth is mentioninga site which can facilitate argument in a rational, piecemeal manner. However, the best-functioning means we have for rational argument are peer-reviewed scientific journals, and that mechanism seems tough to beat, despite its flaws. For instance, Noam Chomsky would say the most respected journals have it all wrong regarding some important issues of foreign policy, and I tend to believe him.
 
My hope of Wikipedia being the savior is probably not going to pan out, but I still view it optimistically, at least as a way of giving voice to those who would be silenced by corporate conflict of interest. I would like to see Wikipedia create a more structured talk/discussion page for resolving disputes on articles, but I only have an inkling for how it could be structured. Hard to believe so many disputes can be resolved by just editing freeform text!

But that would mean the state of knowledge surrounding GW is correspondingly poor, validating skepticism over policy recommendations.
 
Theres a difference between a debate shifting because of partisan strategy and one shifting because of facts. It would be a false choice to imply theyre exclusive of each other.  Do you mean to say that the shift in debate over SS was not driven by partisan strategy?

Scott, i agree, peer-review is about the best alternative we have going; but it has problems too. Im not trying to save the world  just trying to reach some kind of personal consensus of thought.  Doing that in todays media/blogosphere is getting to be almost impossible because of all the polorizing static.  We need some kind of culture that adds some kind of rules to the discourse  it should be obvious when someone is speaking according to the rules, then we can factor their thinking in  when people dont follow the rules, they can be easily ignored.  Peer review does that  but it is slow and as you can see it can be compromised by the bottom line and edited by politicians.  What we have now is not working.  Maybe somebody with some smarts can come up with something more effective.

This wasnt a very satisfying conclusion for me. This same series could have been written ten years ago, and in many places it was. We had the same problems then, and the same vague take back the media solutions were proposed. Now we all have blogs, and we have wikipedia, and we have podcasts. Yet the problem remains. The problem is systemic in scope, but its perpetuated by individuals. Every time we trade accuracy for convenience, refusing to think critically, we contribute to the problem.
 
More information doesnt make us more thoughtful, and the web doesnt seem to demand thoughtfulness any more than Fox or the NYT do. In many ways, it just makes it easier to be mentally lazy. What are we doing to penalize individuals who regularly promote hype over substance or reward individuals who reguarly promote substance over hype? I dont see us doing much at all. I expect more of the same.

Lets be honest here, the media is a fourth branch of the government (which isnt in itself a bad idea - hence the pragmatic justification for freedom of speech). However, like with the other three branches of the government, we have a powerful check on it: we can filter what we accept and what we dont.
 
I presently do not own a television, seldom visit the website of a mainstream news organization (other than local papers and generally through RSS syndication via Google or Yahoo) and listen to independent music (classical composers, electronica and independent rock bands) and use Wikipedia and college libraries over commercial encyclopedias and reference book. Of the people in my peer group (people I am with outside of work, people I went to college with) I am the most disconnected from the mainstream media, but at the mean time am the most informed.
 
The Internet is great is that it can lead people to who would otherwise be unaware of these sources of information to consider it: when one searches for a hot button issue, for instance, they will in the first few pages of their search results see Wikipedia entries. These Wikipedia entries are going to provide them links to scholarly articles, books, etc to allow them to research the issues and consider opinions that may not be otherwise mentioned in the mainstream media both on political/social topics (e.g.: drug de-criminalization being the most common example, or alternatives to public schoolinng, etc..) as well as technical one (operating systems besides MS Windows, programming languages besides Java/.NET (TM) (R)).

Sigh  Aaron, I love this series, but the ending bit  of techno-utopianism in it was a let-down.
 
Then OhmyNews gave a voice to progressives, inspiring massive nationwide protests against the government. The protests, in turn, led to the election of reformist Roh Moo Hyun, now known as the first Internet president. 
 
Thats a fantasy, annoying PR. If only it were so simple.
 
Basically, the very hard problem, as I see it, is trying to construct a system which values whats true over whats popular. The immediate consequence here is that adding more data into the mix doesnt help - its just repeating the same problem over a wider set.
 
Peer review works well in science because there is an appeal to external reality. It doesnt work well for, e.g. foreign policy, because avoiding reality is sometimes lavishly rewarded for policy-makers and politicians (e.g. Iraq).
 
Sorry I cant be more positive. And I have an intuitive sense that any partial solution would be likely to be at least slightly unpleasant.

Jones: Im not sure your description of Paul is accurate and Paul consistently has loony economic ideas, but since a couple people have asked me about this particular comment, I thought Id respond (even though Paul is using socialism in a totally different sense than I am).
 
Pauls argument is that socialism prevents people from getting rich, which discourages smart people from trying to come up with new technology, like semiconductors or light bulbs or the plumbing of e-commerce. Well, lets look at those examples.
 
The semiconductor was invented at Bell Labs by salaried employees. William Shockley, the entrepreneur Paul is probably thinking of, did his work in the mid-1940s and didnt quit the Labs until 1953, when he moved to Caltech, where he didnt work at a company until a friend invited him to in 1955. So it seems hard to argue his work was motivated by wanting to get rich.
 
The light bulb was invented by Joseph Swan who, while a partner at chemical firm, doesnt appear to have been especially motivated by the desire to get rich.
 
Finally, its not clear what the plumbing of e-commerce is, but HTTP/SSL, which allows for credit card numbers to be sent encrypted over the Web, seems a good guess. The HTTPS spec was written by Eric Rescorla who operates a small network security consultancy.
 
I think most people who do great work would do it no matter what they were paid (the Internet is filled with examples). The real people who ought to be paid lots are the people doing the unfun but necessary grunt work that nobody really wants to work. But these are exactly the people that socialists propose to reward! So Im not sure what Pauls talking about, other than himself.

First, some of points Aaron raises (e.g.: mainstream) media ought to be listened to by everyone, including those (like myself) who reject socialism.
 
Second, Aaron, I have a question for you: youre a small web enterpreneuer. Wouldnt a socialist system, if it were fully implemented, hurt people like you (small enterpreuners, who arent looking to own their own private jet airplanes (although they wouldnt object to a cesna 152), but are merely looking to start a startup as to perhaps retire early and do what they enjoy, rather than live paycheck to paycheck)? The truly rich will still exist in a social democracy (e.g.: what occurs in Europe), but the small-business-owning enterpreuner upper-middle-class will be choked to its death by taxation and regulation. To a socialist that may be acceptable as part of utilitarian calculus (on average, everyone may be better of), but that is exactly where my problem with socialism is: it seeks to better society at the cost of individual economic liberty.

Regarding: Id love to see a revisionist piece on OhMyNews. As I was editing this piece for publication, that bit seemed hard to believe, but I didnt really have any other sources to look to. (my emphasis)
 
See the problem? :-)
 
Thats it in a nutshell. The bad data drove out the good. It doesnt matter if the truth is out there somewhere - you couldnt find it, since it was obscured by a mass of marketing hype for the revolution-via-OhMyNews :-(.
 
Heres some skeptical commentary (see link in it) that I happened to know about the Korean election:
 
http://bennett.com/blog/index.php/archives/2004/04/20/seeing-your-face-in-the-mirror/
 
So, what I mean by a system which values whats true over whats popular is setting up peoples incentives so that disseminating and echoing whats accurate is rewarded, as opposed to crowd-pleasing or money-serving data. Science has a way to do this, which is referencing external reality. Nobody has done anything which has really worked in politics, and even minimal attempts require going to unpopular places (by definition!). Moreover, blogging/web/wiki etc. seems to be overall a step backward, since so far its almost a purely popularity-based system. And thats defended vigorously with demagoguery that whats popular is whats best, and anyone who isnt cheerleading it, isnt a goodthinking person (the usual word is elitist, which is a shorter form of pointy-headed intellectual).

Aaron, if this is what your writing is going to consist of, regurgitated talking points from fair.org and democracynow.org, I take back my earlier support for you writing.  There are partisans on both sides trying to sell their own incomplete picture of what is going on and it looks like you have been captured by one party.  In fact, this whole series reads as a textbook example of the kind of bias Mike Sierra argues with you about.
 
Take, for example, the media.  I would posit that theyre predominantly liberal but are forced by a split populace (and perhaps some pressure from their conservative superiors) to present every contested case as an on the one hand on the other hand report, even if one side does seem to have more evidence in its favor for a particular case.  Of course, this does not favor the left or the right as each has particular points that it has more evidence for.  Rather, the loser is the public as the truth is ultimately distorted.
 
I suggest that you take a wider view of all this and carefully consider the evidence provided by both sides.  Right now, youre drinking too much of one partys kool-aid.

It depends on your definition of grunt work, but many of those people do get paid lots. Doctors, plumbers, longshoremen, etc. Even at the lower levels, such as nursing and truck driving, the compensation is fair, and probably more than you think.

Well this is completely possible. You just may not make as much money. The USA, at least, is filled with countless examples of people who mostly just do what they enjoy. Ive lived in Santa Cruz and Hawaii. The surfers just surf. Even here in San Francisco, there are tons of writers, musicians, bike messengers, artists, who just do what they want. Sure you cant live a standard bougiouse lifestyle on those wages, but who cares if you are truly doing what you want to do. Even some of the startup starters around here happen to be doing what they want.

Title: Hurting Seniors: The Attack on Social Security
 
[This is part 6 of an article on the power of right-wing think tanks. See also part one, part two, part three, part four, and part five.]
 
Recent events provide a compelling case study of how this process works. Conservatives have wanted to get rid of Social Security for years. The most successful anti-poverty program in history, it clearly shows how the government can be used to help people  anathema to conservative ideology. Now, with a secure lock on government, is their time to strike. As a White House deputy wrote in a memo that was later leaked, For the first time in six decades, the Social Security battle is one we can win  and in doing so, we can help transform the political and philosophical landscape of the country.
 
Theres extremely strong public support for Social Security  conservatives could certainly never just come out and say they wanted to end it  so their plan is to deceive the public: First, persuade people that Social Security is facing some sort of crisis and wont be around for the next generation. Second, convince them to begin replacing Social Security with a privatized version. Privatization, the logic goes, will naturally keep increasing until all of Social Security is eliminated. The only problem is that Social Security isnt facing a crisis and any form of privatization, which would require both paying out to existing retirees and saving away money for the private accounts of the current generation, would worsen whatever financial problems Social Security does have.
 
But think tanks have been preparing for this moment for years, floating privatization plans and doing their best to persuade the media that Social Security was in imminent danger. So when the Bush administration started up their anti-Social Security campaign, the media knew exactly what to say.
 
CBS, for example, presented a segment featuring man-on-the-street Tad DeHaven. I dont expect to get anything from Social Security, OK? said young DeHaven. Its not going to be therethats my assumption. DeHaven had good reason to say these things: for years, hes been one of the leading Republican activists in the fight to get rid of Social Security. CBS never mentioned the connection.
 
A later CBS report boosted fears that Social Security was going bankrupt by displaying a graphic on the screen that read 2042: Insolvent = 0 benefits?? [sic] (In 2042, Social Security will become insolvent, and todays young workers risk losing their benefits, a voiceover explained.) But this just isnt true: even the pessimistic Social Security Administration concedes that by 2042 Social Security will be able to pay nearly 80% of scheduled benefits, which is still far more than what it pays out today.
 
Other networks were no better. NBCs report feature quotes from Bush saying the system would go flat bust and an interview with a Heritage Foundation scholar  identified only as a social security expert  but allowed no critics to contradict their claims. Meanwhile, an ABC report claimed One thing everyone agrees on, the Social Security system as it exists now wont be able to afford those payments for long after the Wilsons retire. In fact, its quite the opposite: even the most pessimistic predictions say that Social Security will be fine until the Wilsons are statistically dead. Again, no critics got got a voice.
 
Next: Part 7: Fighting Back

Do you actually watch the news or read print media? No critics got a voice?! The plan for partial privatization was a huge controvery and ultimately failed to materialize in Congress. If the government insists on forcing us to set aside a piece of our paycheck for retirement, why not allow us to invest at least a part of it in private accounts? Not only would the rate of return be much higher than what the government provides, but the account would pass on to ones children after they died.

I dont see why social security is worth keeping, especially for me: a fairly large percentage of my paycheck is subtracted for social security, a percentage I wont see until Im sixty five (and honestly, I dont even wish to live until Im sixty five). If I had the option of placing into my 401k, Id be able use ten years earlier and have that money grow at a much greater rate (or, a rate at which Im comfortable with, given this money is intended for me). If I had total freedom to do what I please with it (which to my knowledge the conservatives arent even considering advocating), Id be able to invest as I see fit (my own preference would be either life insurance annunities or municipal bonds). The tiny payment that I will be receiving at age sixty five (granted I even live to that age, which given my present health/genetics I likely wont) is easily dwarfed but what I can get out on the market.

Read a great take on the social security system lately, Im quoting:
 
Id like you to imagine, if you will, and (with a slightly disgusted shake of his head) it wont be too difficult, an organization that sold, and is still selling, a retirement investment pension fund. Heres how it works.
 
The employees have no choice. They must invest because the powers that be dont believe they have enough sense to invest for themselves; as though theyre some kind of irresponsible children.
 
They are assured from the beginning that their money goes into a fund in their name and is invested properly, while what the people running the organization do is take the money to pay for other things; extravagances not in any way associated with the retirement account. So the money never actually gets invested. Instead, when the person finally retires, the money they receive comes from the newer people who are now part of the same system. Its called pay as you go. In the 1920s a man named Charles Ponzi was arrested for running such an investment system, hence the name Ponzi Scheme.
 
Investors are assured of a certain percentage return, and that they can retire at a certain age. And there are many other promises; but the promises keep getting broken, and the rules keep getting changed. But no matter how disgusted the investors become, they are not allowed to opt out. They are prisoners in this system.
 
They are told from the beginning that the money is theirs, but they eventually realize it is not. They dont control the money and they can NEVER pass it along to their heirs.
 
And, by the way, because of the way its been set up all along, this pension fund will eventually go bankrupt and leave lots of people with no retirement income whatsoever.
 
[] how would you feel about a private company in our free-enterprise system running such a shameful program? Would you put its managers in jail? Would you somehow want them punished? More importantly, if you were the investor in this case, would you choose to continue to do business with them?
 
Mainly, I ask, how would you feel about them? Would you be angry and distrustful? Would you do whatever it took to get out of this protect yourself and your loved ones from this type of obvious corruption? Ill bet you would, and I wouldnt blame you one bit.
 
This is your Social Security System.

As much as I hate agreeing with conservatives about anything, I dont find your argument particularly persuasive.  You say that conservatives are trying to scare us with the message that social security is in imminent danger. You say that privatizing social security will make the situation worse.  You pretty much say that the conservatives are flat out wrong.  Those are bold statements  statements that you back up with no citations save for a passing mention of a statistic that supposedly came from the Social Security Administration (again no citation).
 
So, maybe we are okay until 2042 at which time Ill be 61  a mere decade (or maybe more by that time I guess) from retirement.  If the system fails then, Im way more screwed than I am if I begin to fix the situation NOW.  Of course, any wise person is already investing for their future (I like to think Im wise, so I am too), but are you suggesting that we do no further examination of Social Security and just hope it works out?
 
This is the crux of my disagreement with the Democrats (or liberals or progressives or whatever perhaps incorrect label one wishes to use) on the subject of Social Security.  They say that the conservatives are wrong and offer up the year 2042 as an example of a far out date that shows that were safe yet they fail to offer any real solutions to the system.  I guess maybe theyre saying their position is that its not a problem.

Your writing on these topics is just as bad as anything coming out of the republican think-tanks you are railing against. You are making strong statements and providing no citations. Didnt you used to be some sort of web programmer? How about a hyper-link or two to your sources?
 
And while we are playing fast and loose with facts and pollable public opinion, Ill have to disagree with you when you say that there is extremely strong support for social security. Nobody under the age of 50 believes they are going to get anything back from social security. Perhaps this means that the think-tanks succeeded. More likely, enough people have seen the paltry monthly checks their grandparents receive and decided that social security may not be a particularly shrewd investment vehicle.

I fear that there is a deep misunderstanding of Social Security, by John Farmer, Anon, Anon, and starkfist.
 
I suggest reading the Wikipedia article about Social Security, particularly the history section
 
The money you pay into the social security system is not set aside to pay for your retirement.  The money you pay into the system goes to pay for the retirement of those who have retired.  It acts as a safety-net, so that senior citizens arent left homeless and peniless.  In third-world countries, and the United States of a century ago, families live in the same houses all their lives.  Those of working age pay to keep the old and young alive, and those not fortunate enough to have children to care for them end up destitute, on the streets, often dying quickly once they can no longer support themselves.
 
At the end of the Great Depression, it was decided that as part of the New Deal, a safety net was needed for the elderly, much as we need other safety nets such as bankrupcy laws and orphanage, and unemployment benefits.
 
The system works by using the money paid by current workers to retirees, keeping them off the streets.  And it has worked extrordinarily well.  Americas senior-citizens, while many remain in poverty, are irrefutably better off due to the existance of the Social Security program.
 
Social Security is NOT the problem.  The problem is that Republican politicians, starting with Ronald Reagan, figured out that they could replace progressive taxes such as income and estate taxes, with increased Social Security-directed payroll taxes, while increasing spending for the military and for social programs, while claiming that the huge surplus generated by the Social Security program while it had more (baby-boom) workers paying into the system than retirees pulling money out of it, was part of the government budget, and in essence using that money for other things.  Some of the increased payroll taxes and reduced SS benefits (raising retirement age etc.) is a rational response to the coming of the baby-boom generation, which will require a built-up surplus in the SS system to survive.  On the whole, however, it can only be fully understood in its larger context.  The end result has been to increase the tax burden on the middle class, while vastly decreasing the tax burden for the super-wealthy, and at the same time put strain on the Social Security system, to the point where it can be claimed by those same Republicans that the system is broken, that Social Security is bankrupt and defunct, with the intent of replacing it with so-called private accounts.  The not-so-subtle intent of course is to provide an excuse to reduce Social Security payments to those who retire in 20 or 30 years.  By that point, many will have paid into locked private accounts, and the public portion of Social Security will collapse under its own weight.  For an example of how just such a privatization scheme has worked look no further than Chile, where privatization has had a profound impact on the standard of living of millions of Chilean seniors.
 
Therefore, Anon, your cute analogy is disingenuous.  Those who have diverted Social Security funds from their original aims are exactly those who seek to destroy it.  The fiscally-irresponsible Republican Party, which has during the presidencies of Reagan, and both Bushes, increased government spending, both military and non-military, while simultaneously cutting progressive taxes and raising the payroll taxes which most affect the middle- and working-classes, is a party of hypocricy and greed.  For them (and you) to claim that Social Security is broken is almost comically ironic.
 
starkfist: Im not sure I think Aarons done quite enough to back his positionsome citations would indeed be niceyour ad-hom trolling is stupid.
 
Be glad your grandparents arent starving on the street.  And finally, there is broad public support for social security, whatever your intuition may suggest.  Look it up.  And not in your gut.

Jacob,
 
That is exactly my problem with social security: I am forced to pay into a system to support those who paid before me, rather than allowed to save for my own retirement and support myself. Further more, as you have said, it is a regressive tax, so it affects the working and the middle classes even more so (as a full-time salaried Sillicon Valley engineer I have other opportunities to contribute to my own retirement fund and in fact plan to retire early, in any case) - they would be a lot better off if they were allowed to deposit the money taken from them for social security into a 401k.
 
You are right that it is designed as a safety net: however, as an individualist, I dont believe that others should be forced to act as a safety net for me (or that I should act as a safety net for others) by force: there are voluntary safety nets availables, such as insurance annunities and guaranteed municipal bonds. They also have the effect of eliminating free riders: those who elect to participate in them (i.e.: prefer to live paycheck to paycheck) receive no benefits from them.
 
You are right, that I wish conservatives (of whom I am not - I despise the militarist/religious right as yet another form of collectivism) were more straight forward in saying that they do not believe in a safety net system, which however tends to demonstrate the exact opposite of the anathema to ideology theory: they are rather driven to it by special interests (quick summary of US political systems: Republicans are controlled by Wall Street financiers, Democrats are controlled by trial lawyers) rather than any ideological position.

Someone once said that the Democrats are interested in increasing the size of the pie, the Republicans just want a bigger piece of it.  That may or not be true, but Im inclined to believe it.  Purely voluntary safety net programs are worthless to those who live check-to-check, and there are a lot of people like that.  In a Republican world, where people are forced to confront reality (and miracles occur), the poor would naturally do whats in their long-term best interest  you see, fiscal conservatives have an abundance of faith in human nature.  But I wouldnt count on it.  For the liberal-elitist explanation of why, heres a primer: http://www.harvardmagazine.com/print/030640.html.

For Anon who left a message in June of 2006. The Republican overhaul for Soc Sec is based on a plan developed by the CATO Institute. This plan has been implemented in Chile. Read my blog at:
 

 
The CATO plan will only allow investors to select among a variety of Mutual Fund plans. Those who believe they will be able to invest in individual stocks, should Soc Sec be converted to a private plan, will be sorely disappointed.

Title: Saving Business: The Origins of Right-Wing Think Tanks
 
[This is part 5 of an article on the power of right-wing think tanks. See also part one, part two, part three, and part four.]
 
Since the goal of these think tanks clearly isnt to advance knowledge, what are they for? To understand their real goals, we have to look at why they were created. After the tumultuous 1960s led a generation of students to start questioning authority, business decided something had to be done. The American economic system, explained Lewis Powell in a 1971 memo for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is under broad attack from perfectly respectable elements of society: from the college campus, the pulpit, the media, the intellectual and literary journals, the arts and sciences, and from politicians.
 
And business has no one to blame but itself for not getting these things under control: the colleges are funded by contributions from capital funds controlled or generated by American business. The boards of trustees  overwhelmingly are composed of men and women who are leaders in the system. And the media are owned and theoretically controlled by corporations which depend upon profits, and the enterprise system to survive. So business must conduct guerilla warfare by establishing a staff of highly qualified scholars who can be paid to publish a steady flow of scholarly articles in magazines and journals as well as books and pamphlets to be published at airports, drugstores, and elsewhere.
 
William Simon, president of the right-wing Olin Foundation (the same one that later funded Brock) was more blunt: The only thing that can save the Republican Party  is a counter-intelligentsia.  [Conservative scholars] must be given grants, grants, and more grants in exchange for books, books, and more books. (Blinded By the Right, 78)
 
The Powell memo was incredibly influential. Soon after it was written, business began following its advice, building up its network of think tanks, news outlets, and media pressure groups. These organizations begun to dot the landscape, hiding behind respectable names like the Manhattan Institute or the Heartland Foundation. While these institutions were all funded by partisan conservatives, news accounts rarely noted this fact. (Another FAIR study finds The Heritage Foundations political orientation  let alone its funding  was only identified in 24% of news citations.)
 
As the conservative message machine grew stronger, political debate and electoral results begun to shift further and further to the right, eventually allowing extreme conservatives to be elected, first with Ronald Reagan and now with George W. Bush. More recently, conservatives have managed to finally win not only the White House but both houses of Congress. While their policy proposals, when understood, are just as unpopular as ever, conservatives are able to use their media power to twist the debate.

This particular episode is off the hook. The second paragraph is total essence of Chomsky. And then this line: While their policy proposals, when understood, are just as unpopular as ever I swear you lifted that from the man himself.
 
I dont mean this comment to be positive or negative. I just think its interesting given your challenge that your writing is so similar, not only in style but in the content including some level of conscious deception.

Title: Spreading Lies: How Think Tanks Ignore the Facts
 
[This is part 4 of an article on the power of right-wing think tanks. See also part one, part two, and part three.]
 
But do the right-wing think tanks even care about the facts? In his autobiography, Blinded by the Right, David Brock describes his experience being recruited for one right out of college: Though I had no advanced degrees, I assumed the grandiose title of John M. Olin Fellow in Congressional Studies, which, if nothing else, certainly impressed my parents.  My assignment was to write a monograph, which I hoped to publish as a book, challenging the conservative orthodoxy on the proper relationship between the executive and legislative branches of government. This topic was chosen, Brock explains, because with a squish like Bush in the White House  the political reality [was] that the conservative agenda could be best advanced by renegade conservatives on Capitol Hill. (79f)
 
Needless to say, paying fresh-faced former college students lots of money to write articles that serve political needs is not the best way to get accurate information. But is accurate information the goal? Look at John Lott, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute  the same right-wing think tank that promoted The Bell Curve. Lotts book More Guns, Less Crime claimed that his scientific studies had found that passing laws to allow people to carry concealed weapons actually lowered crime rates. As usual, the evidence melted away upon investigation, but Lotts errors were more serious than most.
 
Not content to simply distort the data, Lott fabricated an entire study which he claimed showed that in 97% of cases, simply brandishing a gun would cause an attacker to flee. When Internet critics begun to point out his inconsistencies on this claim, Lott posted responses under the name Mary Rosh to defend himself. I have to say that he was the best professor I ever had, Lott gushed about himself one Internet posting. There were a group of us students who would try to take any class that he taught. Lott finally had to tell us that it was best for us to try and take classes from other professors.
 
Confronted about his alternate identity, Lott told the Washington Post I probably shouldnt have done it  I know I shouldnt have done it. And yet, the very next day he again attacked his critics, this time under the new pseudonym Washingtonian. (It later got so bad that one of Lotts pseudonyms would start talking about posts from another Lott pseudonym.)
 
Lott, of course, is not the only scholar to make things up to bolster his case. For comparison, look at Michael Bellesiles, author of the anti-gun book Arming America, which argued guns were uncommon in early America. Other scholars investigated and found that Bellesiles had probably fabricated evidence. Emory University, where Bellesiles was a professor of history, begun an investigation into the accuracy of his work, eventually forcing him to resign. His publisher, Knopf, pulled the book out of print. Libraries pulled the book off their shelves. Columbia University revoked the Bancroft Prize the book had been awarded. The scandal was widely covered in academic circles. Bellesiles was firmly disgraced and has not shown his face in public since.
 
And what happened to Lott? Nothing. Lott remains a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, his book continues to sell well, his op-ed pieces are still published in major papers, and he gives talks around the country. For the right-wing scholar, even outright fraud is no serious obstacle.

Yes, I think its fair to say so based on Emorys final report on Bellesiles.
 
Giving both the same benefit of a doubt, the my-dog-ate-it-ness of Lotts phone survey that he claims was lost in a computer crash appears roughly equivalent to Bellesiles explanations concerning various data he says were lost when his office was flooded, and also the dubious provenance of San Francisco data referenced in the Emory report as question #3.
 
Emorys panel also found a great deal of sloppy, biased research that led to a systematic undercount of guns in the period he examined, going to the heart of his thesis. Much of Bellesiles remaining dog-didnt-eat-it data simply could not be reproduced, not the case for Lott.  But what they ultimately nailed him on was data he intentionally omitted because it contradicted his thesis (question #4), again surpassing Lott.
 
In short, with Bellesiles you could point to many problems that undercut his academic work, whereas for Lott you had to focus on one. As repellant and unacceptable as Lotts sock puppetry is, it doesnt go to the substance of his academic credibility.  (When determining the ultimate veracity of an academic work, you simply dont consult Amazon reviews and blog comment sections.)  All this is not to defend the decision not to fire Lott, but to offer an explanation why there were different outcomes in the two cases.

Title: Endorsing Racism: The Story of The Bell Curve
 
[This is part 3 of an article on the power of right-wing think tanks. See also part one and part two.]
 
If you have any doubt about the power of the think tanks, look no further than the story of The Bell Curve. Written by Charles Murray, who received over 1.2 million from right-wing foundations for his work, the book claimed that IQ tests revealed black people to be genetically less intelligent than whites, thus explaining their low place in society. Murray published the 845-page book without showing it to any other scientists, leading the Wall Street Journal to say he pursued a strategy that provided book galleys to likely supporters while withholding them from likely critics in an attempt to fix the fight  contrary to usual publishing protocol. Murrays think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, flew key members of the media to Washington for a weekend of briefings on the books content. (What Liberal Media?, 94)
 
And the media lapped it up. In what Eric Alterman has termed a kind of Rorschach test for pundits, (WLM?, 96) every major media outlet reviewed the book without questioning the accuracy of its contents. Instead, they merely quibbled about its proposed recommendations that the dumb blacks, with their dangerously high reproductive rates, might have to be kept in a high-tech and more lavish version of an Indian reservation without such luxuries as individualism, equal rights before the law, and so on. Reviewers proposed more moderate solutions, like just taking away their welfare checks. (WLM?, 94)
 
But such quibbles aside, the amount of coverage alone was incredible. The book received cover stories in Newsweek (the science behind [it] is overwhelmingly mainstream), The New Republic (which dedicated an entire issue to discussion of the book), and The New York Times Book Review (which suggested critics disliked its appeal to sweet reason and are inclined to hang the defendants without a trial). Detailed articles appeared in TIME, The New York Times (makes a strong case), The New York Times Magazine, Forbes (praising the books Jeffersonian vision), the Wall Street Journal, and the National Review. It received a respectful airing on such shows as ABCs Nightline, PBSs MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, the McLaughlin Group, Think Tank (which dedicated a special two-part series to the book), ABCs PrimeTime Live, and NPRs All Things Considered. With fifteen weeks on the bestseller list, it ended up selling over 300,000 copies in hardcover.
 
This wasnt just a media debate about the existence of global warming or the merits of internment, this was a full-on media endorsement of racism, which the American Heritage Dictionary defines as The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others. Nor did the media mention the works political intentions. On the contrary, they presented it as the sober work of social scientists: Nightlines Ted Koppel lamented to Murray about how his great deal of work and research had become a political football.
 
Of course, this was almost certainly Murrays intention all along. In the book proposal for his previous book (Losing Ground, an attack on government welfare programs) he had explained: Why can a publisher sell this book? Because a huge number of well-meaning whites fear that they are closet racists, and this book tells them they are not. Its going to make them feel better about things they already think but do not know how to say. Thats certainly what The Bell Curve did, replacing a debate over how to improve black achievement with one about whether such improvement was even possible.
 
There was just one problem: none of this stuff was accurate. As Professor Michael Nunley wrote in a special issue of the American Behavioral Scientist on The Bell Curve, after a series of scientific articles debunked all the books major claims: I believe this book is a fraud, that its authors must have known it was a fraud when they were writing it, and that Charles Murray must still know its a fraud as he goes around defending it.  After careful reading, I cannot believe its authors were not acutely aware of  how they were distorting the material they did include. (WLM?, 100)

One thing is perfectly clear from reading this post. You have never read the book. Youre relying on secondhand accounts to denounce it outright. First, as you noted, the book is over 800 pages long. Only a small portion of the book concerns itself with the topic of race and intelligence. Second, it does not make the claim of black people to be genetically less intelligent than whites. It says that there are statistically significant differences between the mean intelligence scores of whites and blacks that cannot be satisfactorily by environmental causes. The fact that a difference exists is widely believed. The big question that remains is why does such a difference exist. Murray does suggest that some genetic factors may play some role. That is an important distinction.
 
There was no full-on media endorsement of racism. The reason the book received so much coverage in the media was because it was so controversial and many people were denouncing it. Its cover story in The New Republic, for example, included 12 rebuttals.
 
Incidentally, Professor Michael Nunley is an anthropologist, not a psychologist, psychometrist, or even a staistician. However, many members of those professions have written reasoned critiques of The Bell Curve, just as many have written supportive reviews of the work.

Well, the real questions here are really:
What is intelligence?
and then
Is intelligence is innate or not? - the nature vs nurture debate.
 
I have not done any personal research into either,
but if it was shown that intelligence (in some form or another) was genetically determined - and was accurately measurable.  And if results did indeed show that black people were, on average, less intelligent than white people -
 
then making such a statement would be as racist as saying that black people, on average, have a darker skin tone than white people.

Title: Making Noise: How Right-Wing Think Tanks Get the Word Out
 
[This is part 2 of an article on the power of right-wing think tanks. See part one.]
 
Malkins book on internment was no more accurate than the corporate misinformation about global warming. Historians quickly showed the book badly distorted the government records and secret cables it purported to describe. As just one example, Malkin writes that a Japanese message stated they had [Japanese] spies in the U.S. Army when it actually said they hoped to recruit spies in the army. But it should be no big surprise that Malkin, who is, after all, an editorialist and not a historian, didnt manage to fully understand the complex documentary record in the year she spent writing the book part-time.
 
Malkins motives, as a right-wing activist and proponent of racial profiling, are fairly obvious. But how did Mary Dombrowski, the Bainbridge Island parent, get caught up in this latest attempt to rewrite history? Opinions on global warming were changed because big business could afford to spent millions to change peoples minds. But racial profiling seems like less of a moneymaker. Who invested in spreading that message?
 
The first step is getting the information out there. Dombrowski probably heard about Malkins book from the Fox News Channel, where it was ceaselessly promoted for days, and where Malkin is a contributor. Or maybe she heard about it on MSNBCs Scarborough Country, a show hosted by a former Republican congressman, which had Malkin as a guest. Or maybe she heard it while driving and listening to FOX host Sean Hannitys radio show, or maybe Rush Limbaughs. Or maybe she read a review in the New York Post (which, like Fox News, is owned by Rupert Murdoch). Or maybe she read about it on a right-wing website or weblog, like Townhall.com, which publishes 10 new conservative op-ed columns every day.
 
All of these organizations are partisan conservative outlets. Townhall.com, for example, is published by the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing Washington, D.C. think tank. Most people imagine a think tank as a place where smart people think big thoughts, coming up with new ideas for the government to use. But thats not how Heritage works. Nearly half of Heritages $30 million budget is spent on publicity, not research. Every day, they take work like Malkins that agrees with their ideological prejudices and push it out through the right-wing media described above (Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, New York Post) and into the mainstream media (ABC, NPR, New York Times, Seattle Times).
 
They use a variety of tactics. Heritage, for example, publishes an annual telephone directory featuring thousands of conservative experts and associated policy organizations. (The Right Nation, 161) And if looking up somebody is too much work, Heritage maintains a 24-hour hotline for the media, providing quotes promoting conservative ideology on any subject. Heritages information marketing department makes packages of colored index cards with pre-printed talking points for any conservative who plans to do an interview. (The Right Nation, 167) And Heritage computers are stocked with the names of over 3,500 journalists, organized by specialty, who Heritage staffers personally call to make sure they have all the latest conservative misinformation. Every Heritage study is turned into a two-page summary which is then turned into an op-ed piece which is then distributed to newspapers through the Heritage Features Syndicate. (What Liberal Media?, 83)
 
It all adds up: a 2003 study by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, the media watch group, found conservative think tanks were cited nearly 14,000 times in major newspapers, television, and radio shows. (By comparison, liberal think tanks were cited only 4,000 times that year.) That means 10,000 additional quotes of right-wing ideology, misleading statistics, distorted facts, and so on. Theres no way that doesnt unfairly skew the public debate.

Title: Shifting the Terms of Debate: How Big Business Covered Up Global Warming
 
[Heres the first part of an article I wrote last year about how right-wing think tanks shift the debate.]
 
In 2004, Michelle Malkin, a conservative editorialist, published the book In Defense of Internment. It argued that declassified security intercepts showed that Japanese internment during World War II  the government policy that relocated thousands of Japanese to concentration camps  was actually justified in the name of national security. We needed to learn the truth, Malkin insisted, so that we could see how racial profiling was similarly justified to fight the war on terror.
 
Bainbridge Island was the center of the evacuations; to this day, residents still feel ashamed and teach students a special unit about the incident, entitled Leaving Our Island. But one parent in the district, Mary Dombrowski, was persuaded by Malkins book that the evacuation was actually justified and insisted the school was teaching a one-sided version of the internment story, propaganda that forced impressionable children into thinking that the concentration camps were a mistake.
 
The schools principal defended the practice. As the Seattle Times reported:
 
We do teach it as a mistake, she said, noting that the U.S. government has admitted it was wrong. As an educator, there are some things that we can say arent debatable anymore. Slavery, for example. Or the internment  as opposed to a subject such as global warming, she said.
 
True, Japanese internment isnt a controversial issue like global warming, but ten years ago, global warming wasnt a controversial issue either. In 1995, the UNs panel on international climate change released its consensus report, finding that global warming was a real and serious issue that had to be quickly confronted. The media covered the scientists research and the population agreed, leading President Clinton to say he would sign an international treaty to stop global warming.
 
Then came the backlash. The Global Climate Coalition (funded by over 40 major corporate groups like Amoco, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and General Motors) began spending millions of dollars each year to derail the Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty to help reduce global warming. They held conferences entitled The Costs of Kyoto, issued press releases and faxes dismissing the scientific evidence for global warming, and spent more than $3 million on newspaper and television ads claiming Kyoto would mean a 50-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax.
 
The media, in response to flurries of blast faxes (a technique in which a press release is simultaneously faxed to thousands of journalists) and accusations of left-wing bias, began backing off from the scientific evidence. A recent study found only 35% of newspaper stories on global warming accurately described the scientific consensus, with the majority implying that scientists who believed in global warming were just as common as global warming deniers (of which there were only a tiny handful, almost all of whom had received funding from energy companies or associated groups).
 
It all had an incredible effect on the public. In 1993, 88% of Americans thought global warming was a serious problem. By 1997, that number had fallen to 42%, with only 28% saying immediate action was necessary. 1 And so Clinton changed course and insisted that cutting emissions should be put off for 20 years.
 
US businesses seriously weakened the Kyoto Protocol, leading it to require only a 7% reduction in emissions (compared to the 20% requested by European nations) and then President Bush refused to sign on to even that. In four short years, big business had managed to turn nearly half the country around and halt the efforts to protect the planet.
 
And now, the principal on Bainbridge Island, like most people, thinks global warming is a hotly contested issue  the paradigmatic example of a hotly contested issue  even when the science is clear. (Theres no better scientific consensus on this on any issue I know, said the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, except maybe Newtons second law of dynamics.)2 But all this debate about problems has kept us away from talk about solutions. As journalist Ross Gelbspan puts it, By keeping the discussion focused on whether there is a problem in the first place, they have effectively silenced the debate over what to do about it. So is it any wonder that conservatives want to do the same thing again? And again? And again?

Nice article.  Id be interested to understand why this didnt happen in other parts of the world.  Ive lived in the UK most of my life, where saying you dont believe in global warming is generally an invitation to ridicule.  We have our own large oil company, BP, who could have attempted to sway UK public opinion in the same way that US companies did (in particular you mention Amoco, which BP took over in 1998).  Apparently they either didnt try in the UK, or they didnt succeed.  I wonder which and why?

You seem angry that conservatives are allowed to disagree with the position you support.  Part of free speech, that.
 
Also, you seem to imply that everyone who doubts global warming (or has ever doubted, I guess) is a malicious, deliberate liar.  Not true.  I had my doubts about global warming, and while I no longer doubt that anthropogenic global warming is real, I still think there is a good deal of uncertainty in the details.
 
Also also, you seem to be upset that the Kyoto treaty failed.  What is your response to Lomborgs criticism of the Kyoto treaty: in brief, that it would have been extremely expensive while accomplishing nearly nothing in terms of preventing global warming?

Its an absurd argument. Lets say a large asteroid was going to hit Earth in ten years and cause major climate chaos. Would you denounce a program to blow up part of the Asteroid as extremely expensive while accomplishing nearly nothing? No, obviously it needs to be done, even if its not the whole thing.

Im not sure if you are being sarcastic here, but I am guessing you are not.
 
Pretty much everything you wrote gave me that impression, starting with the title.  If you are not objecting that right-wing think tanks Shifted the Debate, what was the point of the article again?
 
If you are not accusing those who Shifted the Debate of deliberate dishonesty, what is the last paragraph of the article supposed to be saying?
 
[I ask you about Lomborg and his argument about the costs and benefits of Kyoto]
 
You: Its an absurd argument. [asteroid analogy]
 
Interesting.  I could see saying he made mistakes, but the claim that comparing costs to benefits is absurd, I did not expect.  I dont think your position is reasonable.
 
(And yes, this does apply to blowing up asteroids too.)

Problems concerning the environment, it would seem to me, are not suitable to be subject to such analyses. The simple fact is that, if you acknowledge that the problem exists, there is no sensible course of action other than to do everything in your power to fix or slow down the progression of the problem. If we dont, we will have a lot more pressing things to do than sit around and shoot the shit about economics. Like, for example, head for higher ground.

Matt apparently sees no difference between disagreeing and well-funded campaigns to shift the terms of the debate. Hopefully other readers did not make the same mistake and perhaps the later pieces will clarify things for Matt.
 
As for Lomborg, I didnt say the idea of comparing costs and benefits is absurd, I just suggested that taking one small piece out of context and doing so for it is problematic.

As Global Warming, if it is a fact, should be on top of our ur national adgenda, i have started a jump list that presents references for a reading list on both sides of the issue.  You and anyone else concerned about this issue are certainly invited to help this list grow and hopefully we will be able to focus the issues in a level headed manner apart from all the polorizing rhetoric.

in the 1960s, PCB contamination was shown to cause cancer, like global warming, there was strong scientific concensus. The Right fought the banning of PCBs. Thousands of additional people suffered as the Right fought and luckily lost. When I say right I mean religious right. They always fight science, guess it contradicts literal bible belief.
 
when will the far right learn that the environment is not a politcal issue. PCB did not ask for political affliation, it poisoned all.

There is definitely a consensus among the climate scientists that global warming is under way. However, imo, focusing on Global warming is squandering activism resources that can be better spent on activism against the root cause: Unabashed Consumption. What is causing global warming?
1> Fossil fuelswhy are we living in suburbs and driving SUVs. What are we so far behind Europe and Asia pacific when it comes to public transportation. Even car pooling does not cut it. Maybe a $10/gallon gas would do it for us!
2> Steaks: A source of green house gases(Methane in this case) is cow farts. Not trying to be offensiveits the plain truth.
 
I think rather than focusing on the large companies(which are no doubt in to maximize profits rather than sustainability of our existence), we need to focus on ourselves. I hope we dont have to wait for catastrophes like mass desertification, loss of ozone(or even $10/gallon gas) to wake up

As far as I can tell the science is NOT clear.  It seems that the argument for GW is being made with a plethora of studies showing correlation b/t temp and human activity, but I cant find anything that shows causation.  The fact is, science itself is simply too young to speak definitely on a subject as complex (in the scientific term of the word) as climatology.  Eg, the direct observation sample size of the last century is too small.  If anyone knows of any compelling causation studies though, please post.  Consensus, even among scientists, as an argument just doesnt persuade me.

I was searching for some evidence of creativity among the Wikipedia user pages and found, yet again, an article that indicates that global warming is a slam-dunk, yet neglects to back up this position. While you cite numerous articles on bias (which, of course, is the point of your article) you cite no links to an affirmative, end-all argument to back up global warming. If the science is clear as you say, then why is it so hard to provide a clear argument without resorting to opinion polls, anecdotes and questionable statistics proclaiming the overwhelming consensus of government grant-based researchers (which, by the way, are notoriously politically biased).

Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And yes.
 
And you dont have to be conservative to be a skeptical economist, environmentalist, or scientist.  Cost/benefit ratios do need to be considered, particularly in terms of environmental response, where action is often just as damaging in unforseen ways as inaction.  And consensus is no way to run science - successful science goes against the defined scientific consensus almost %100 of the time - thats kinda the definition of progressive science.
 
I recommend reading Michael Crichtons essay on the subject, which addresses bad science and consensus arguments for MAD, Nuclear Winter, second-hand smoking, and primarily Global Warming issues.  I also recommend The Skeptical Environmentalist by Bjorn Lomborg, and the many interesting discussions occurring within the skeptic community in science literature and skeptic literature such as Skeptic magazine and the discussion groups for the JREF.
 
And for the love of god, can people on this blog stop using the word skeptic like its a bad word?  Im a skeptic about E.T.s, Psionics, and Dowsing, too.  We cant even trust a 24 hour weather forecast, and you expect everybody to trust that a 200 year forecast will provide %100 accuracy?
 
Arent there any scientists left in the scientific community?  The next person who uses the word consensus gets a sextant shoved up his un-scientific ass.

I think there are already a lot of solutions. For example a car that can drive 100km with less than 3 liters of gas. The only thing why the industry still blocks this car is to make money.

There are a lot of things to consider here.  I agree that global warming is real.  I also agree with most scientists that we (humans) are responsible.  I also agree that the U.S. WAS the primary contributor of greenhouse gasses worldwide.  Now comes the hard part.  We no longer are.  In fact, we arent a lot of things anymore.  We dont have the fastest growing most vibrant economy.  We dont have the best and brightest scientific talent anymore.  Etc. Etc.  Most important is the fact that there are a lot of emerging former third world countries that want their piece of the pie at all costs.
 
Costs are the problem.  And people like you that say to do something at all costs is an elitist.  Try telling this all costs theory to someone that lives inland and really needs to feed his family.  We are already losing market share in almost every category overseas, and you want to tell him that the pine beetle life-cycle should be important to him(it is to me)?  The fact of the matter is this:  economics always matter.  Especially to the majority of people at the bottom of it.  Not the economics of the next 100 years, but the economics of this year.  Hell, this month.  So, if your solution to the problem (which I agree is important) doesnt FIRST address this, why should people buy in.  Is your livelihood at stake?  Probably not.

Title: An Inconvenient Truth
 
Al Gores presentation on global warming is filled with graphs  Gore is fanatical about collecting evidence, even at one point going to the North Pole to persuade the scientists there to release their records of the ice shelves  but only one of them really matters. It comes early in the film, as Gore talks about the large ice core samples that scientists take to trace the history of the Earths temperature and CO2 ratings.
 
Gore shows the results of these samples and then says we can go back further. The screen expands in both directions to show a massive graph of CO2 concentration going back 600,000 years. Its had its fluctuations over that time  large hills and then valleys. Underneath it, he then graphs temperature over the same period.
 
Temperature tracks CO2 almost exactly, with a several-decade lag. Those large fluctuations? Those were the six ice ages weve had over the past 600,000 years. CO2 in the atmosphere goes up and so does the temperature, the CO2 trapping the suns radiation inside our planet, where it heats the Earth.
 
These huge fluctuations are the difference between ice ages and where we are today. Then Gore shows the most recent trajectory of CO2: straight up, more than doubled. If that much CO2 in one direction causes an ice age, Gore says, imagine what it will do in the other direction. And then he shows the projections for the next 50 years. Again straight up, another doubling. This is literally off he charts, he explains. He has to climb up to reach that peak.
 
Not a single number in this graph, he says, is in dispute. This is the inconvenient truth: unless we change, we will destroy the environment that sustains our species.

Share An Inconvenient Truth
 
or enable others to share it.  Allow me to explain:
 
I was finally able to see the movie last Sunday.  Ever since then, like Lawrence Lessig, Ive been haunted by wanted to act.
 
So I created a site, a framework for a community, where people can pay for the tickets of others.  http://sharethetruth.us.  This is not an
advertisement in the sense that I wish to make any money or publicity whatsoever.
 
I just launched it, so theres totally just tumbleweeds there, but I have high hopes that if people start visiting, some of those people were inspired by the film, like me.
 
I believe that real change, which gives us a fighting chance against possibly the most important issue in our lifetime, cannot happen without political will from the top down.  And for that to happen, awareness must spread enough for the general populace to muster up enough resources to make enough noise to make it happen.
 
At any rate, the site is fully functional but Im going to add lots to it to streamline the mechanism whereby people can help others.
 
Id appreciate it if you just had a look.  Thank you for your time!
 
Best regards,

I disagree. And this is the sentiment I believe that Al Gore was referring to in the movie when this topic has been slow to action with our government.  Do you really need someone to tell you what to do?  Educate yourself.  Learn how you can make a difference.  And Al Gore does offer some examples of what can be done and at the end of the movie there are many examples cited while the credits are rolling.  You can make a difference every day in the choices you make going through your daily life.

Human civilization is a ever expanding multidimensional web driven by the pursuit of wealth and power.  As the web grows larger and the number of humans gaining access to the wealth and power increases.  Which in turn increases the growth and decreases the chances of controlling the growth.  Eventually the growth will exceed the caring capacity of the earth and there will be a significant die off (i.e. typically 90-95% in most population growth experiments).  The earth will rebalance over a period of thousands of years.  And life will continue on for another 4 billions years or so until the sun inevitably turns into a red giant and consumes the earth prior to going super nova.
 
Realistically everybody should just enjoy the time they have left.  There really is no way the hand full of worrying westerners are going to convince the billions upon billions of  3rd world poverty stricken Asians to stop growing there new found industrial wealth.  They were really looking forward to this being their century after all.  And dont want any gloom and doomers spoiling their plans.

There is more CO2 dissolved in the ocean than in the atmosphere. As the ocean warms, it releases CO2. Gore has the tail wagging the dog. This is well known in climate paleontology, from what I have found.
 
CO2 has increased by 30% since that guy in Hawaii started measuring it in the 1950s. His data is very good. The atmosphere already absorbs 88% of outgoing 10um band radiation. By increasing CO2 by 30% we are already halfway there to the full effect of saturation of CO2 absorption. Going beyond doubling CO2 will have the same effect as putting another coat of black paint on an already blacked out window.  Gore does not mention this, and even suggests that temperature will track CO2 with no limit. This is wrong. 
The earth will warm a bit more. Warmer winters, longer growing seasons (helped by more CO2), more water out here in the Western US due it increaes rainfall from more water evaporation. Effects will be mixed, some good, some bad.  We just have to live with the uncertainty while taking what steps we can (insulating houses, fully inflating our car tires, more hybrids etc.).
 
But you have to keep questioning things.
Does anyone know of an estimate of the latent heat in the icecaps? Could this be keeping temperature relatively constant while the ice melts? When the ice is gone, temperature would then reach a higher equilibrium. The GW could, then, be more than double the effect we are witnessing now. It is very difficult to get real answers in this field. There is so much hype and so many half truths on both sides. I will keep looking.

Having finally watched this film, I was rather surprised that he used this graph so predominantly. Although I cant find the exact graph that he uses, this is the same info: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/63/Co2-temperature-plot.svg
 
As you can see, in many or most cases, the peaks of CO2 occur hundreds of years after the temperature peaks. This would indicate that rises in CO2 are a symptom of higher temperatures, and not a cause.
 
Before you dismiss me as a denier, Id like to mention that yes, it is obvious that temperatures have risen in recent years, and that yes, Man probably has something to do with it. I just hope we dont pin all of our resources on fixing something that might not be the true cause of the situation.
 
In response to Burgess - Id LOVE to see a printed set of materials to accompany the film. The official website is inconviently missing any of it.

I saw Inconvenient Truth for the first time last evening. What struck me as extremely odd was the graph of CO2 and temperature over the past 600,000 years. In the movie, it looks very much like swings in the temperature graph preceed swings in the CO2 graph. I havent found the data he used, but I did find a recreation of the graph. What I saw confirms what I thought I saw in the movie. If true, then his argument is turned upside down  CO2 doesnt cause temperature, rather temperature causes CO2.

Youve got it backwards. Watch the movie again. The CO2 lags behind the spike in temperature by close to 800 years. The CO2 is the result of the temperature rise. Not the other way around. This is one of the fundamental flaws of Gores film. The spike in CO2 is caused by the massive amount of CO2 generated by the oceans of the world, but because theyre so big it takes decades, even hundreds of years for the effect to be noticed. In essence the oceans today are a reflection of what our environment was like hundreds of years ago. Ask yourself a question why is there a rise in CO2 600 years ago? I know I wasnt driving a car around back then. Its because its natural. The Earth Changes. In fact without CO2 wed be a giant ice ball in space.

Title: Legacy
 
Ambitious people want to leave legacies, but what sort of legacies do they want to leave? The traditional criterion is that your importance is measured by the effect of what you do. Thus the most important lawyers are the Supreme Court justices, since their decisions affect the entire nation. And the greatest mathematicians are those that make important discoveries, since their discoveries end up being used by many who follow.
 
This seems quite reasonable. Ones legacy depends on ones impact and what better way to measure impact than by the effect of what youve done. But this is measuring against the wrong baseline. The real question is not what effect your work had, but what things would be like had you never done it.
 
The two are not at all the same. It is rather commonly accepted that there are ideas whose time has come and history tends to bear this out. When Newton invented the calculus, so did Leibniz. When Darwin discovered evolution through natural selection, so did Alfred Russel Wallace. When Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, so did Elisha Gray (before him, arguably).
 
In these cases the facts are plain: had Newton, Darwin, and Bell never done their work, the result would have been largely the same  wed still have calculus, evolution, and the telephone. And yet such people are hailed as major heroes, their legacies immortalized.
 
Perhaps, if one only cares about such things, this is enough. (Although this seems a rather dangerous game, since the future could wake up at any moment and realize its adulation is misplaced.) But if one genuinely cares about their impact, instead of simply how their impact is perceived, more careful thought is in order.
 
I once spent time with a well-known academic, who had published several works widely recognized as classics even outside his field, and he offered some career advice in the sciences. (Actually, come to think of it, there are two people of whom this is true, suggesting the phenomenon has broader significance.) Such-and-such a field is very hot right now, he said, you could really make a name for yourself by getting into it. The idea being that major discoveries were sure to follow soon and that if I picked that field I could be the one to make them.
 
By my test, such a thing would leave a poor legacy. (For what its worth, I dont think either persons works fall into this category; that is to say, their reputation is still deserved even by these standards.) Even worse, youd know it. Presumably Darwin and Newton didnt begin their investigations because they thought the field was hot. They thought through doing it they would have a significant impact, even though that turned out to be wrong. But someone who joined a field simply because they thought a major discovery would come from it soon could never enjoy such a delusion. Instead, they would know that their work would make little difference, and would have to labor under such impressions.
 
The same is true of other professions we misconceive of as being important. Take being a Supreme Court justice, for example. Traditionally, this is thought of as a majestic job in which one gets to make decisions of great import. In fact, it seems to me that one has little impact at all. Most of your impact was made by the politics of the President who appointed you. Had you not been around for the job, he would have found someone else who would take similar positions. The only way one could have a real impact as Supreme Court justice would be to change your politics once appointed to the bench and the only way you could prepare for such a thing would be to spend the majority of your career doing things you thought were wrong in the hopes that one day you might get picked for the Supreme Court. That seems a rather hard lot to swallow.
 
So what jobs do leave a real legacy? Its hard to think of most of them, since by their very nature they require doing things that other people arent trying to do, and thus include the things that people havent thought of. But one good source of them is trying to do things that change the system instead of following it. For example, the university system encourages people to become professors who do research in certain areas (and thus many people do this); it discourages people from trying to change the nature of the university itself.
 
Naturally, doing things like changing the university are much harder than simply becoming yet another professor. But for those who genuinely care about their legacies, it doesnt seem like theres much choice.

Although this seems a rather dangerous game, since the future could wake up at any moment and realize its adulation is misplaced.
 
Really? Has that ever happened? It seems to me we should do what most needs doing because it most needs doing, not with some expectation that doing it will improve our standing in history. Because most likely it wont.

It seems to me theres a contradiction in what you write above. Youre discussing the Great Man vs. Historic Inevitability theories. However, if this applies to scientific innovation, then it also should apply to social change. You seem to be saying Great Man doesnt apply to science, that science is Historic Inevitability, but Great Man does apply to social change (trying to do things that change the system instead of following it).
 
But why isnt social change also under Historic Inevitability? Indeed, Id say the case for that is better than for science. However, it makes no sense to blithely assert its true for one and not the other.
 
For example, Rosa Parks is a situation which is usually told as a Great Woman story, but (meaning no disrespect), it was very much that changing the system then had enormous pressure behind it and there was a search for a good plaintiff.
 
Sometimes people are just in the right place at the right time, this is widely true.

The main argument of the piece is not that the Great Man or Historic Inevitability arguments are right, but that the right way to measure a legacy is by the diff with what would have happened otherwise.
 
If you accept this premise, then we can discuss what the diff would be. I argue that in many fields of science and technology, the diff would be very small in many cases. And, as evidence, I cite the frequent simultaneous discovery and invention of major things. (Even though some discoverers or inventors receive substantial applause.)
 
And youre right that the Rosa Parks story is a similar myth. Far from acting alone, Rosa Parks was a member of a well-organized group that was looking for a test case to fight the bus system. Rosa was that test case, but others could have been as well.
 
I didnt mean to suggest that lone acts of heroism are the way to make a legacy. Instead, what I was trying to say was that if you had to choose between something like making a major scientific discovery and making a major contribution to a social change movement, you should pick the latter, because fewer people will do that and thus it will make the largest diff with what would otherwise happen.

Aaron, I understand thats your argument. Im saying  its not clear how it can be true. This phrase has the flaw:
 
because fewer people will do that and thus it will make the largest diff with what would otherwise happen
 
How can you derive that? To me, the processes seem very similar. In terms of Historic Inevitability theory, a major contribution to a social change movement happens when the world is ready for it, in the same way a major scientific discovery happens when the groundwork is done beforehand. And theres the same sort of politics in that practioners of that field wonder what are the hot areas where major contributions are low-hanging fruit.
 
If one is going to be making the contribution on the basis of talent, thats not something you can control - theyre different skills, and for a major contribution, Id say you basically either have it or you dont. If one is going to be making the contribution on the basis of hard work, theres no way to claim it makes more of difference, in the sense that anyone can work hard at their chosen field.

There are plenty of people out there who want to make a social change through different means, be it Supreme Court justices, politicians, religious leaders, non-profit workers, social commentator or even scientist. I think its more important to do something you enjoy than worrying about leaving a legacy. I agree with Seith, sometimes people are just in the right place at the right time.

Title: Gmail Down
 
My Gmail account has been down for over two days. When I try to log in, it says its down for maintenance and they dont know how long it will take. When I try to get my mail through POP, it simply doesnt work. And when I contact the Gmail people, all I get back is form responses. Ive used Gmail as my mail client for the past couple years, so if youve sent me mail and I havent responded  thats why.
 
The thing that really puzzles me is why. I can understand occasional outtages, but I cant understand what could cause my account to go down for days, unless they lost my data and are too embarassed to actually tell me. The only thing I can think of is that something went wrong and theres just no one around to fix it. Which, considering Gmails popularity, would be kinda sad.
 
Sorry to bug you with my personal problems, but obviously its time for me to switch away from Gmail. Ive been careful to always keep my email going to my main server, so I havent lost too much data, but figuring out a way to read my mail again is rather difficult.
 
I get absurd quanities of spam (40,000 spam messages a month) so my mailboxes are just full of junk. And its not clear to me how to clear it out. A bayesian filter like bogofilter requires non-spam messages to train on  and if I had my non-spam messages, I wouldnt need a spam filter. Spamassassin seems to work better, but its incredibly slow and inaccurate, taking a couple seconds per email (at this rate it will take days to see my mail again).
 
If you have any suggestions (or youre a person at Google who can turn my account on again) feel free to help. If you want to email me, Im checking feeds@reddit.com.

GMail has been working fine for me, although my mac.com email is down today.
 
GMails spam filter is pretty good - only a few pieces a week get through, but I end up with about 150 spams a day.
 
I use Dreamhost for my web hosting & main email account and I find that their spamassassin is pretty useless, since it has most of the network tests disabled & doesnt let you override the settings.
 
Rather than install my own copy of SpamAssassin, I installed SpamBouncer and I find that it works very nicely. Ive been fine-tuning it for the last week and its a lot better than SpamAssassin, although it takes a lot of tweaking of the procmailrc & whitelist files. I have it redirecting my spam to a separate spambox account which I only check with webmail every few days, so it doesnt bother me most of the time.

I love how this is Letters to the editor instead of Comments! Fresh!
 
Ive had those maintenance problems with Google periodically, altho I can get into mine right now even tho you cant and that makes me feel badly. :(
 
I wonder if ones Gmail account gets slower to use, the more email you have in it. It may just be psychological but mine has been crawling lately.
 
BTW, Aaron, for some reason, I get a popup message that says 550 /robots.txt: No such file or directory. when I load your main page @ aaronsw.com, but this only happens to me on Firefox and not IEand I tried Firefox on another computer and it didnt show me the error. I wonder whats up.

That is strange, I am able to use my gmail account (which I mainly use as an anonymous throw away account these days) - even from my work (which is googles chief competitor, especially in the domain of email).
 
My advise is simple: you have a colocated machine (or at least access to one), so do what makes the most sense: postfix + procmail + SpamAssassin + mutt (with perhaps a layer of IMAP in between). Ive yet to find any webmail client which is as responsive and as fast to use - on mounds of email - as that. Many of my friends endlessly complain of email woes: of their mail boxes over flowing with spam, of not being able to keep up with mailing lists; yet, since 1998 (when I first started using mutt), Ive not even close to have experienced these very woes.
 
I also much prefer writing email in vim or emacs than doing it through firefox or gmail - way more productive in that way. Sometimes twenty-thirty year old technologies work way better than the new fangled ones.
 
I do have to say that gmail is quite possibly the only webmail system which provides support for threading, sorting/searching and filtering that can come close to the mutt + procmail combination. Yet, its close, but its no cigar :-)

Gmail did something funny to me recently, too (actually to one of my users - we use it for office email). On the 1st of this month, this user logged in and ALL of her email was deleted. All incoming, outgoing - even spam messages had been deleted.
 
We emailed Google and their Support staff suggested that the account had been compromised and someone manually deleted all of the messages in question. That seems unlikely to us, but I guess it is always possible.
 
Anyhow - I hope you get your email back. Keep us updated on this thread.

because fewer people will do that and thus it will make the largest diff with what would otherwise happen
 
How can you derive that?
 
fewer people: look at the relative size of serious social movements to academic departments. largest diff: increases the size of the movement by a greater percentage than it increases the size of the science department.
 
In terms of Historic Inevitability theory, a major contribution to a social change movement happens when the world is ready for it
 
Well, thats all very nice, but do you have any evidence?

Aaron, come on. Youre drawing the wrong conclusion.
I can assure you, google is not a company that would sit on its hands, forgetting to look at things that dont work. Im certain they have a ton of alarms on their systems, many specific to gmail.
Im also sure they have engineers working on fixing known bugs  its a mature, high-visibility product.
 
Furthermore, if gmail had a wide-spread two-day long outage, you would have certainly heard about it in the media, be that in well-read blogs or dead-wood mediums.
 
A more plausible conclusion than that they stupid and lazy (which I think is the gist of your argument, although more gently put), is that you are unfortunate enough to be entangled in a problem that is severe in its impact, but probably not widespread enough (does not affect enough users or affects a good number, but gmail hasnt realized it yet) to merit gmails attention. In any case, its not at the top of their priority list. In other words, they have better things to do.
 
Unfortunate for you? Yes. Indicative that gmail could be doing a better job? Yes. Something went wrong and theres no one around to fix it? I doubt it.

Hey Aaron,
 
I know you didnt say that  I wasnt trying to say that you did.
 
I was just trying to lay out the possibilities:
 
A) Neglect/stupidity
 
B) Willfull ignorance.
 
I think their behavior falls under B. If there indeed had been
large-scale outage, it would certainly be A.
 
Furthermore, if it is B, then your problem must have been narrow in scope.
 
And yes, I am defining myself to be right. In other words, my
assumption is that they are competent and therefore your problem must
be limited to few users. I just think thats more likely to be correct
than if I assumed they were incompetent.
 
And while youre right its upsetting that they are ignoring the
products failure, no matter how limited the number of affected users,
wouldnt you agree that every large scale, individualized product
(where profit is derived from volume) is probably managed this way?
I.e. if you have a sufficiently large user base X and the incremental
value (V) to you of an addition user is small, i.e. $0.25, then there
must be some number Y where if Y or less users are affected, it simply
doesnt make any sense to fix the problem.
In summary, I would posit that, for any individualized service where V
is small and X is large, there is some Y where Y*V is not worth an
engineers time.
 
Of course, you as an individual user can try to increase the cost of
your problem to gmail. I.e. because you have influential blog, your
problem is already way more costly to google (b/c of PR implicaitons)
than a nameless Joes problem, which is still only worth V.
 
This is actually generalizable also in that sometimes an
individuals problem can cost far greater than Y. For example: When a
websites personalization engine fails for a single user, no one
cares. The personalization feature has low incremental benefit for a
single user. But when the individuals problem for some reason
generates costs much greater than V (i.e. the engine suggests users
looking to adopt consider abortion  a huge PR problem), then of
course the equation doesnt hold.

Title: A Non-Programmers Apology
 
In his classic A Mathematicians Apology, published 65 years ago, the great mathematician G. H. Hardy wrote that A man who sets out to justify his existence and his activities has only one real defense, namely that I do what I do because it is the one and only thing that I can do at all well. I am not suggesting, he added,
 
that this is a defence which can be made by most people, since most people can do nothing at all well. But it is impregnable when it can be made without absurdity  If a man has any genuine talent he should be ready to make almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate it to the full.
 
Reading such comments one cannot help but apply them to oneself, and so I did. Let us eschew humility for the sake of argument and suppose that I am a great programmer. By Hardys suggestion, the responsible thing for me to do would be to cultivate and use my talents in that field, to spend my life being a great programmer. And that, I have to say, is a prospect I look upon with no small amount of dread.
 
It was not always quite this way. For quite a while programming was basically my life. And then, somehow, I drifted away. At first it was small steps  discussing programming instead of doing it, then discussing things for programmers, and then discussing other topics altogether. By the time I reached the end of my first year in college, when people were asking me to program for them over the summer, I hadnt programmed in so long that I wasnt even sure I really could. I certainly did not think of myself as a particularly good programmer.
 
Ironic, considering Hardy writes that
 
Good work is not done by humble men. It is one of the first duties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate a little both the importance of his subject and his own importance in it. A man who is always asking Is what I do worthwhile? and Am I the right person to do it? will always be ineffective himself and a discouragement to others. He must shut his eyes a little and think a little more of his subject and himself than they deserve. This is not too difficult: it is harder not to make his subject and himself ridiculous by shutting his eyes too tightly.
 
Perhaps, after spending so much time not programming, the blinders had worn off. Or perhaps it was the reverse: that I had to convince myself that I was good at what I was doing now, and, since that thing was not programming, by extension, that I was not very good at programming.
 
Whatever the reason, I looked upon the task of actually having to program for three months with uncertainty and trepidation. For days, if I recall correctly, I dithered. Thinking myself incapable of serious programming, I thought to wait until my partner arrived and instead spend my time assisting him. But days passed and I realized it would be weeks before he would appear, and I finally decided to try to program something in the meantime.
 
To my shock, it went amazingly well and I have since become convinced that Im a pretty good programmer, if lacking in most other areas. But now I find myself faced with this dilemma: it is those other areas I would much prefer to work in.
 
The summer before college I learned something that struck me as incredibly important and yet known by very few. It seemed clear to me that the only responsible way to live my life would be to do something that would only be done by someone who knew this thing  after all, there were few who did and many who didnt, so it seemed logical to leave most other tasks to the majority.
 
I concluded that the best thing to do would be to attempt to explain this thing Id learned to others. Any specific task I could do with the knowledge would be far outweighed by the tasks done by those Id explained the knowledge to.1 It was only after Id decided on this course of action (and perhaps this is the blinders once again) that it struck me that explaining complicated ideas was actually something Id always loved doing and was really pretty good at.
 
That aside, having spent the morning reading David Foster Wallace2, it is plain that I am no great writer. And so, reading Hardy, I am left wondering whether my decision is somehow irresponsible.
 
I am saved, I think, because it appears that Hardys logic to some extent parallels mine. Why is it important for the man who can bat unusually well to become a professional cricketer? It is, presumably, because those who can bat unusually well are in short supply and so the few who are gifted with that talent should do us all the favor of making use of it. If those whose judgment of the markets is quick and sound become cricketers, while the good batters become stockbrokers, we will end up with mediocre cricketers and mediocre stockbrokers. Better for all of us if the reverse is the case.
 
But this, of course, is awfully similar to the logic I myself employed. It is important for me to spend my life explaining what Id learned because people who had learned it are in short supply  much shorter supply, in fact (or so it appears), than people who can bat well.
 
However, there is also an assumption hidden in that statement. It only makes sense to decide what to become based on what you can presently do if you believe that abilities are somehow granted innately and can merely be cultivated, not created in themselves. This is a fairly common view, although rarely consciously articulated (as indeed Hardy takes it for granted), but not one that I subscribe to.
 
Instead, it seems plausible that talent is made through practice, that those who are good batters are that way after spending enormous quantities of time batting as a kid.3 Mozart, for example, was the son of one of Europes leading musical teachers4 and said teacher began music instruction at age three. While I am plainly no Mozart, several similarities do seem apparent. My father had a computer programming company and he began showing me how to use the computer as far back as I can remember.
 
The extreme conclusion from the theory that there is no innate talent is that there is no difference between people and thus, as much as possible, we should get people to do the most important tasks (writing, as opposed to cricket, lets say). But in fact this does not follow.
 
Learning is like compound interest. A little bit of knowledge makes it easier to pick up more. Knowing what addition is and how to do it, you can then read a wide variety of things that use addition, thus knowing even more and being able to use that knowledge in a similar manner.5 And so, the growth in knowledge accelerates.6 This is why children who get started on something at a young age, as Mozart did, grow up to have such an advantage.
 
And even if (highly implausibly) we were able to control the circumstances in which all children grew up so as to maximize their ability to perform the most important tasks, that still would not be enough, since in addition to aptitude there is also interest.
 
Imagine the three sons of a famous football player. All three are raised similarly, with athletic activity from their earliest days, and thus have an equal aptitude for playing football. Two of them pick up this task excitedly, while one, despite being good at it, is uninterested7 and prefers to read books.8 It would not only be unfair to force him to use his aptitude and play football, it would also be unwise. Someone whose heart isnt in it is unlikely to spend the time necessary to excel.
 
And this, in short9, is the position I find myself in. I dont want to be a programmer. When I look at programming books, I am more tempted to mock them than to read them. When I go to programmer conferences, Id rather skip out and talk politics than programming. And writing code, although it can be enjoyable, is hardly something I want to spend my life doing.
 
Perhaps, I fear, this decision deprives society of one great programmer in favor of one mediocre writer. And lets not hide behind the cloak of uncertainty, lets say we know that it does. Even so, I would make it. The writing is too important, the programming too unenjoyable.
 
And for that, I apologize.
 
Explaining what that knowledge is, naturally, a larger project and must wait for another time.
 
You can probably see DFWs influence on this piece, not least of which in these footnotes.
 
Indeed, this apparently parallels the views of the psychologists who have studied the question. Anders Ericsson, a psychology professor who studies expert performance, told the New York Times Magazine that the most general claim in his work is that a lot of people believe there are some inherent limits they were born with. But there is surprisingly little hard evidence  . The conclusion that follows, the NYTM notes, is that when it comes to choosing a life path, you should do what you love  because if you dont love it, you are unlikely to work hard enough to get very good. Most people naturally dont like to do things they arent good at. So they often give up, telling themselves they simply dont possess the talent for math or skiing or the violin. But what they really lack is the desire to be good and to undertake the deliberate practice that would make them better.
 
The quote is from Wikipedia where, indeed, the other facts are drawn from as well, the idea having been suggested by Stephen Jay Goulds essay Mozart and Modularity, collected in his book Eight Little Piggies.
 
Ive always thought that this was the reason kids (or maybe just me) especially disliked history. Every other field  biology, math, art  had at least some connection to the present and thus kids had some foundational knowledge to build on. But history? We simply werent there and thus know absolutely nothing of it.
 
It was tempting to write that the rate of growth accelerates, but that would mean something rather different.
 
Many people, of course, are uninterested in such things precisely because they arent very good at them. Theres nothing like repeated failures to turn you way from an activity. Perhaps this is another reason to start young  young children might be less stung by failure, as little is expected from them.
 
I apologize for the clichdness of this example.
 
Well, shorter than most DFW.

This was an interesting read, Aaron, and Im largely sympathetic with your line of reasoning and with Hardys too.
 
I cannot begin to comprehend the loss I would feel personally if Bach had been a baker instead of a musician  and one could erase my memory of the music but not memory of my feelings about the music. At the same time, who is inhuman enough to say that a Mozart who hates music and for whom the continuing practice of music is an existential torture should be forced to continue for the benefit of all?
 
You mention Mozart (W. A.) and that he began instruction at age 3 (actually, it probably began in the womb given his fathers position), but say nothing of the millions of children who have piano teacher parents, begin music lessons before in infancy, and yet never grow up to be a Mozart, however much they try to make it happen. For every child that grows up to be a Glenn Gould (piano teacher parent, read music before language), there are thousands in the same situation that just dont learn as quickly and hit a plateau somewhere between competency and mastery. Lots of children take music lessons and have musician parents, but few will ever be great musicians. Consider Josef Hoffman, who practiced 20-30 minutes daily as a child, and never more than 2 hours a day late in his musical education, and consider the millions of children now who practice 2 to 3 times as much for the same period of time. It just does not make sense to say that its purely a matter of learning. Some peoples learning slope is always steeper than that of others, and some people  in the music world, at least  have attained greater mastery at 8 years of age  (Hoffman, Gould, Mozart) than others will ever attain.
 
On the subject of programming, I am a programmer, and I often interview programmers for work. From my experience, the better programmers that I interview are not necessarily those who have the most experience. Most of the fresh-out-of-college people I interview have been programming since they were quite young, and very few of them have any kind of insight into the craft of programming. Most have knowledge of programming  some have lots  but very few have wisdom. Fast forward 10 years or so, and look at programmers who have been crafting their skills professionally for 10 year or so. How many Bill Joys do you think there will be? Maybe we should wait another 10 years? Still no Bill Joys. Most professional programmers are mediocre, and all the practice in the world does not change that. In my experience, few have the passion and talent required. Passion, talent, environment, and practice are necessary but not sufficient causes.
 
As to your distaste for programming, Ill quote Dijkstra: programming is to computer science as telescopes are to astronomy. Do you have the same distaste and aversion for computer science?
 
If you decide you want to be a writer, then dont be too critical at first. The writers you read and admire honed their talents for years before they were able to write the kind of prose that makes us all feel inadequate. You may or may not have talent, but it will take at least a few years to know for sure.

A man who sets out to justify his existence and his activities needs no defense. I do what I do because I want to - and need no other reason.
 
Hardy could not always do mathematics well and so there must have been a time when he did mathematics for another reason. Im sure that someone of Hardys stature became good at maths at a fairly young age, but if we only extend an exemption to the young (who dont know what they are good at yet) he is precluding the possibility of ever switching.
 
As you suggest, people who want to do something are probably going to become good at it over time. If its true that it takes at least ten years of concentrated study and practice to become an expert[1] then switching comes at a high cost. Like yourself and Mozart Ive followed the profession of my father and I believe that my current competence owes a lot to living 10 miles away from school and friends while growing up, leaving lots of time for practice.
 
But you dont owe the world a great programmer and, although you arent going to be a great writer by next week, you should start guilt free.

Much here 
 
Theres a difference between being a great X, and having skill at X. And its even possible to do great things even if youre only skilled at X, by either accident, or intense work - but they are not the same. As to the nature/nurture argument, I believe the effects of nurture are commonly underestimated and nature is often used as an excuse for inadequate nuture. However, there are some indications that while its not clear what exactly makes a great X, at some point, its pretty clear if youre NOT going to be one.
 
But in any case, if you can be a great X, but youd rather be a mediocre Y, because you hate doing X, and like doing Y, it seems like youre taking a very long route to simply say that Hardy is wrong because if you dont like X, you wont be a great X in the first place (which is kind of a straw-man rebuttal - I assume Hardy knows that argument, and believes you should do your best at X, even if you dont like it).
 
Regarding the best thing to do would be to attempt to explain this thing Id learned to others., well, the problem is that its a really tough road. Ive been down it, and whether its a flaw in my character or not, Ive very much given it up. It sounds good, but its a lot easier said than done. You might even be over-estimating your ability to follow it, especially in the face of the backlashes. Though I am well-known to be extremely bitter on this point.

What youre encountering is that while you might be good at programming, so are a lot of other people; youre also good at other things (of which writing I think is a symptom and not a cause), and there are comparatively fewer people who are also good at those other things.
 
I say writing is a symptom not a cause because I think writing is simply the channel youve been using to express great ideas that you want to put into more concrete action.  This is all theorycraft, however ;)
 
In any case, Ive always been of the opinion that one should do what one loves in life, and thus Id heartily encourage you to pursue those other things with all your heart, soul and body.

First off, if you truly have unwavering passion and energy for writing (or whatever), you can probably be great at it.  That is more important that innate skill, assuming a basic level of competence.
 
Second, concerning your epiphany:  You may eventually come to believe that the media is a normal business, and that the news is demand driven.  Why are there endless reports about issues like Terry Shiavo?  Because they are cheap to produce, and people pay attention, and then look at the accompanying ads.
 
But if the media product is just a function of public demand, the way to solve the problem is to change the public, not the system.  There is probably no way that we can structure media organizations to produce good news with a public that is asleep at the wheel.  Spending your life trying to correct that problem might appear much less enticing.

Then if you look at your reasons a couple decades after you concocted them, you will certainly laugh.  Reason more accurately falls after the fact and there too it finds no more value that before.

Funny, I went through the opposite transition.
 
During high school and my first few years of college I was completely into politics.  I volunteered for political campaigns, interned in Congress, and worked in city hall.  I combed libraries for books ranging from Plato to Ayn Rand, Rush Limbaugh to Noam Chomsky.    But midway through college I got bored with too much talk and too much theory.  Its easy to read a couple of books and think that you have found some great new insight, and that if everyone would just listen the world would make itself right.  Ive been there too.  But political realities, human nature, and the forces of intertia make change much more difficult in practice.  I started getting much more into programming and startups because you have the ability to create something that is of actual value.  Results are measurable instead of endlessly debatable.  I do hope to return to politics later on in life when I have more experience (and money!), but for now, I want to do something concrete, not just talk.

Aaron: I went through a similar crisis two years ago and chose math over programming (after trying economics for a while). The decision was easier for me because I was only a decent programmer. But both of us were young coders and know how quickly it may be learned. You may as well ditch it for a few years and see what happens. My experience is that I can learn a topic well enough to know if Ill be good at it in one year (as with politics, economics, computer science and math). So the 10 year investment to become an expert is only a 9 year investment considered with much more information.
 
That writing is a symptom of programming and not a cause (as Dominik said) is also true of math. Fortunately math has objective measures of skill, and I knew that I liked and was good at it immediately. The more difficult decision, only recently apparent, is whether I want the lifestyle of a mathematician.
 
Worrying about being great at what you do is a waste of time. You are smart enough to be very good at whatever you choose, but predicting the next G. H. Hardy is not possible. My original ambition was to be a great mathematician, but it has faded as Ive realized the joy in doing math anyways. (That I will be able to make money off of it makes the decision easier).
 
Could your decision not to code be the result of burnout? As exams ended two weeks ago I never wanted to do math again. But after relaxing I feel much better about it. My observation is that despite your skill, you have had difficulties getting your company off the ground. I dont think this is entirely a reaction, but you should think about it.

So i started college studying computer science and ended college addicted to and with a degree in philosophy.  Blame it on my evangelical christian upbringing.  This morning (at age 29) im sitting with my wife at a coffee shop, reading a book on Kierkegaard and thinking about how I need to keep coding strong so the startup Im involved with will succeed.  Luckily my net connection at home is down so i can justify sitting here reading with my coffee for a couple more hours.  Nonetheless, i find that my interest in coding and my interest in writing/philosophy are both constants in my life.  Maybe youll find your drive to write doesnt end up excluding programming.  I had to spend a number of years avoiding the computer just to clarify my position on my own existence but once I had delved deeply enough I found a place where my widely divergent interests could co-exist.  All that is just to say that I doubt you will totally forget programming, you might just need to put it down for a while.

I have seen similar things and have been programming since I was young too.  Now I am older and I am not saying I am a master or not.  But, it seems like with such a large life investment you would really be recognized and make a mark on history.  But, programming seems difficult to really get your thoughts out there.  Even look at some of the greats; Knuth, Norvig.  These guys are geniuses but outside the circle on their respective domains they probably wouldnt even get a nod.  But, I thought computer science was important?  Worse yet, think about Dan Brown; his book sold some 40 million copies of his Da Vinci Code and I think it was mediocre at best (that is being nice).  Angelina Jolie just had a baby and you would think she cured cancer.
 
You want to get your name out there as well.  And programming probably wont get you there.  So you have looked at other avenues.

All work is an act of philosophy. (Ayn Rand)
 
Programming can be as much an creative work of self-expression as it can be a mundane code-monkey kind of work. Especially when you decide that crafting your own tools is the main part of the job.
 
What I dont get is that there should be a discrepancy between doing what you would enjoy doing most and doing what you are best at. I always thought that the former, preference regarding work (doing what one enjoys most), derives from the latter, i.e. everyone automatically enjoys most what he is best at (whether that may be actual skill and crafted ability or some own potential that one is confident one can reach). So yes, my thinking went, do what you love, implying because what you love is what youre best at. A bit simplistic perhaps, just my own interpretation of my individual situation
 
Dont feel guilty if you dont know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didnt know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still dont.

Ive been debating the link between passion and greatness myself.  Unlike you, I have never been a great programmer - Id gotten by for several years as one solely on my aptitude for making computers do what I want.  I never coded in my free time, I never liked coding, but it was easy work (for me) that paid well, so I did it.  But I eventually realized I would never be great at it unless I deeply cared about it.  And I didnt.
 
Dont let aptitude define you.  Find what you love and follow it.  If I step back and pay attention to the things Im actually excited about, that get me animated and talking fast and waving my arms, its pretty clear what I should be doing.  In my case, its management, or at least the process of creating a viable corporate community, so Im in the process of launching my third career.  Well see if I continue to care about it as I get more into it.

Most businesses arent demand-driven. Does Ford come out with new, only slightly-modified cars because people are demanding new, only slightly-modified cars? Not at all; they change them slightly and then run tons of absurd ads of people driving over mountains to create demand. Same thing with knockoff drugs and other big industries. Its pretty absurd to blame to people for this one; they dont exactly have a choice. The only thing they can do is stop watching the news  and indeed they have.

(For the sake of discussion, I am ignoring the fact here that Ford may be a failind company.)  I see this differently.  Ford creates crap products and runs lots of ads because that is what the public demands (where we let their behavior speak for their demands).  If running lots of ads is effective, a company that created quality cars and didnt waste money on advertising would be immediately run out of business by a crap-car high-advertising company.  This certainly isnt the companys fault: the only blame can lie on the population.
 
Again, I really have to disagree.
 
I admit that it is an oversimplification to say that it is a demand-driven situation.  I am sure that in the modern DC climate, reporting scandals involving Republicans has much higher costs, in a nn-monetary sense, than reporting scandals involving Democrats.
 
However, the fact is that if people demanded better news they would get it.  Slight changes in the cost to produce different types of news would be totally overwhelmed by demand if people turned their ad-watching eyeballs towards news that gave a better picture of reality.

So, if advertisers or the media have the power to brainwash people, how come they dont get all of them to buy Ford cars?
 
The way I see it, using the Ford example, is this: they appeal / reach out (by ads) to that portion of the population that values the Ford brand for sentimental or other reasons, and driving across mountains, over car quality or total-newness. That is, they want to capture and serve as much of the existing demand for these values as they can. So does any other business. Is there something Im missing here? I dont buy the hypnotisation-by-pictures-or-words-rather-than-real-drugs theory until convinced.  ;)

By justins logic, if Ford went around putting guns to peoples heads and forcing them to buy cars, itd still be the populations fault, because people fell for it and Ford has to do whatever people fall for to stay competitive. If people really had a problem with it, after all, theyd get the government to take away the guns. Meanwhile, Philipp would say that Ford is simply doing their best to capture the afraid-of-death market. See? The corporations arent responsible no matter what they do; its always the publics fault at bottom.

Similar thoughts struck me when I was at a recent programmers conference, the Lisp thing in Hamburg. I spent the first dinner mostly talking politics with a cool fella from Turkey; as the night wore on, I felt kinda ashamed and searched out people to talk about Proper programming topics.
 
The next day, I felt like such an outsider, and I didnt want to spend my entire day with a bunch of men talking about programming. Whenever I opened my mouth, it seemed like all I had to say was garbage. Started seeing them as the technocrats who had an unusual understanding of how societys institutions worked, as they automated much of it [1]; but outside their job roles didnt have more influence than anyone else. (So for example, they might worry about the environment, but had to pretend to desire discussing sports at the oil companies they worked at. Many of them even hid their Lisp usage, for Christs sake! Their power was only magnified when they were rowing in the right direction.)

If Ford would go for the guns, you would be right, but it remains to be shown convincingly (maybe that is what Chomsky did?) that for example advertising (i.e. trying to persuade by some kind of argument or statement, rather than by force), is actually something similarly forceful that people invariably fall for like for a drug.
 
The people who believe this try to construct an argument that advertising is inherently fraudulent, and if it were, the analogy with guns would hold and advertising should rightly be opposed and met with contempt. However, I fail to see an inherently fraudulent nature in advertising. Just as environmentalist protesters with banners or union workers at a strike, it is someone with a proposition asking us for our attention. Correspondingly, just as with other works of fiction, a great many people tend to treat advertising and the media with a grain of salt, and stick what corresponds to their set of values and opinions, in my opinion.
 
Surely this kind of reasoning, although my own and maybe not justins, cannot be dismissed as a religion with the entity pursuing an action being the sole ethical standard of value (i.e. whatever that entity, say companies or bureaucrats or intellectuals, choose to do is good because they are the ones doing it, even if they threaten to kill someone not belonging to that class of entities). Nothing could justify the fact that a company tried forcing others to deal with them. I just dont see how advertising would be an initiation of force.

Thats exactly right.  Why *doesnt Ford put guns to peoples heads, do you think*?  Because they are too nice for that?  Corporations cannot have other goals than making money because if they did, competing corporations more singlemindedly focused on making money would displace them.  If corporations are to behave decently, it can only be because we structure the system so that being decent is profitable.
 
The other alternative is getting rid of corporations.  Putting aside if that is a good idea, how would it be done?  The population would have to demand it of their leaders.

In the last few posts youve written in a spooky, quasi-religous voice about a fad diet, Noam Chomsky, and implied that David Foster Wallace is a great writer.

Luckily these are writers and topics that often grip the mind of impressionable college students. (I personally was a zen-buddhist vegan into Wittgenstein from age 19 to 22.)
 
It takes a while to get your critical thinking skills back on track after being exposed to these sorts of things, especially if youre a typical lonely programmer working on something thats not very intellectually challenging.
 
However, if you keep it up, youre headed down the road to kook-dom. From my own experience, I wouldnt suggest trading your Silicon Valley connections for the Shangri-La McSweeneys Media Consipracy crowd. It takes longer than you think to get back into a world where people actually DO stuff.

I trust that you will bring an intelligent and critical mind to the proceedings and will discover the flaws in that program soon enough, allowing you to move on to writing about more interesting topics.  In fact, maybe you can build a publishing platform for writing like yours, allowing you to dabble in some programming while you focus on your writing.  The web allows for a lot of creativity in changing the medium of publishing, which hasnt really been leveraged yet (blogs are only the first step).

I believe you are both a good programmer and a good writer. OK, so you prefer to write. Its great to be able to earn a living by doing what you like best. But I think you should consider the fact that, for people who can do both things well, writing is easier than coding. I know a lot of people wont agree with this, so give it some thought and see what you think.
 
When you program, you normally have a definite goal in mind, and the job is done when the program finally does what you wanted it to do. Pretty objective.
 
Writing, on the other hand, is totally subjective. No compilers to tell you you are missing a dot in line 42. We all expect to find plenty of bugs in early stages of software developing, but we are less inclined to accept that our drafts are also full of bugs. Soaring with them.
 
The difference is that an article that is 60% well written makes quite a good read, whereas code that is 60% good is no good at all. A bad writer will go much further than a bad programmer, and whats worse: bad writing passes for good writing more easily.
 
No matter how severe you are with yourself, you will be more demanding with your code than with your prose. You will push your limits harder, learning all the way through. You can spend some hours writing a decent essay, and you will get a feeling of satisfaction in the end. It takes a lot more to write satisfactory code. You can even convince someone (e.g. yourself) that a piece of writing is good. Try that with a program that doesnt work.
 
Summing up: your writing is buggy. [Note: Im obviously not saying that mine is better, especially since English is not my mother tongue.] Im sure you know this and you accept it because you are young and it takes a lot of time to become a great writer, etc. Thats a type of self-delusion that you are much less likely to confront when programming.
 
These are only some of the reasons that make writing easier than coding, there are many more, different for each person (and of course you could also argue that programming is harder than writing for many reasons as well). I just wanted to ask you: Are you sure (really sure) that you are not choosing to write just because it is easier?
 
As Terry Pratchett said: If you stay true to yourself, follow your dreams, reach for the stars and never stop wishing youll still get beaten by the people who got off their butts and worked hard.

I disagree: good writing is never totally subjective. While its true that fiction tends to be more subjective than non-, its not as if either is without form.  In good writing, you tend to present an idea (or character) before fleshing it out, which strikes me as analogous to declaring variables or limiting their scope.  Likewise, your reference to compilers refers simply to your choice of grammar and spelling, which can both be perfect and yet still be pointless.
 
On the other side of the question, lets not underestimate the creative choices programmers often face.  Theres usually no single way to accomplish a lot of interesting tasks. Instead, you typically have to strike a subjective balance between code thats the easiest to express and maintain, the fastest to execute, the most abstract and easily extensible, indeed which language serves you best. Syntax checkers and debuggers only go so far as programming tools. They cant tell you, for example, that a chunk of the code you just wrote is a waste of time because theres already a library available that does the job more efficiently, or conversely that that library is buggy and you can do it better yourself. I guess thats why a lot of programmers are drawn to attend conferences and yak about these things with each other, and instead wind up in the other room talking politics.

It seemed clear to me that the only responsible way to live my life would be to do something that would only be done by someone who knew this thing  after all, there were few who did and many who didnt, so it seemed logical to leave most other tasks to the majority.
 
I think youre mistaking disbelief for ignorance. Plenty of people read Chomsky and dont find his arguments very compelling. justin, for example, made some reasonable arguments against what Chomsky says, and you responded with petulant sarcasm. I hope this isnt a sampling of the important writing youre talking about doing instead of programming.

In one sense, maybe theres not so much difference between writing and coding.
 
Its programmers whore inventing new tools for writing, new genres of writing, and who are actually sitting down and test driving them and learning the skills to use them.
 
Udell is pretty good on this here :
 
http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html
 
Beyond this, both writing and coding are about organizing thoughts using some kind of language. Clearly the type and expressivity of language is different. But if youre in the game of political writing, a large amount of what you want to do is describing how things are (representing it as a data-structure) and outlining steps for how to change things (a program).
 
Looked at from a high enough level, programming is about using language to organize the world. A computer scientist like Herbert Simon studied organizational psychology and computer science in parallel, cross-pollinating between them. Most non-fictional writing has, as its objective, to organize and co-ordinate people in some way, whether its law, business, politics, marketing you write to create an effect.

Took the chomsky challenge back at MIT. His books are interesting (both linguistics and politics) but not something that changed my life as it seems to change others. Maybe Im part of the problem?
 
Regarding diet, the Shangri-La diet is just a calorie restriction diet, using shots of olive oil as an appetite supressant. The set point theory is interesting, and I suppose that concept might be worthy of further study. However, you can achieve the same result with healthy eating and exercise.
 
Im six foot one and am slim/athletic. I put on about 50 pounds during my first startup (up to 211 from 165) , and lost 30 of it simply by going for an hour bike ride every day, and giving up beer and soda - things I needed to do anyway.
 
The next 20 required a bit more effort, but at six-one/180, the remaining weight loss was more about vanity rather than health.
 
Regarding authors, DFW is too boring for my tastes, although he wrote a good article for the Atlantic a long time ago about being on a cruise ship, or something. Personally Id suggest Paul Theroux, Gordimer, Coetzee, V.S. Naipaul, Murakami, Chandler, etc.

I faced a similar dilemma in college.  Ten years on, I guess Im still dealing with it.  I was born with a talent for visual art which was cultivated throughout my education.  By my mid-twenties, I had the right degrees, connections, etc., to pursue a career in art, even if only to teach at the college level.  But I had lost seeing the value in it.  A Klimt painting sold for some $130M+ last week, but I wouldnt pay more than a few hundred bucks for any painting.  And I didnt feel that I shared concerns in common with the professional art community  they cant even agree on what art is.
 
That said, perhaps life is too short to worry about your obligation to your talent or even the worth of your talent to society.  Youre not a packaged good, are you?  If you could take a pill that would restore your interest in and dedication to programming, would you accept it as an alternative solution to your problem?  Would you be happy if you didnt become a great writer?  If you have the ability to do something you like, by all means dont hesitate.  Ironically, I became a programmer, albeit not an exceptionally passionate or capable one.  Worse, I got an MBA.  I had a lot more fun creating images.
 
BTW, Ford is most definately a demand driven company, although one that struggles to respond to demand.  Toyota has developed organizational capabilities that allow it to respond to demand much faster than its competitors, which in turn reduces inventory costs, commands a higher premium, etc.  But flexibility is expensive.  Toyotas workers are actually paid quite well  more than GMs in some instances.  Furthermore, Ford and GM are now well aware of what Toyota does, but cultures are much harder to change than machinery.

You should not be too hard on yourself about writing,

[] But I think you should consider the fact that, for people who can do both things well, writing is easier than coding.
 
Why, exactly, is it that only something thats complicated is worth doing?  People always love to over-complicate things and thus dont see the simplicity.
(Writing something like Siddhartha [Hesse] is definitely not easy.  Especially when you look at when this book was published, its amazing that a western man understood the culture and philosophy of the far east so well.)
 
I just wanted to ask you: Are you sure (really sure) that you are not choosing to write just because it is easier?
 
There is a difference in just writing something, e.g., a technical document, and writing a novel.  In Kafkas diary is an amazing entry about how he wrote The Judgement.
Its not just about documenting some API.
You need to be talented-just like writers as Kafka were-to write a really great novel.  The way Kafka, Walser (Robert), Novalis, Eichendorff and many more used the german language is impressive.  Einstein, after returning a Kafka novel loaned to him by Thomas Mann, said that, I couldnt read it for its perversity. The human mind isnt complicated enough.
There were many people who tried to copy Kafka or Mann or other famous authors, but in the end, they were just copies.  Only few people-if at all-use the german language that well nowadays.  Especially today where language has no value anymore, its even harder to be-stylistically-as good as all those writers back then.
 
Writing isnt something that you can do along the way to later return to your programming.  You have to dedicate your life to it, and all the great writers did.  Peter Handkes story Nachmittag eines Schriftstellers (A writers afternoon) is exactly about this: how you think and feel as a writer.  Writers are always occupied with words, with transforming what they see into words.  Not just when they write, but all the time.  If you look at manuscripts of Hermann Hesse, youll see that there are almost no corrections, almost no crossed words or even sentences; thats something many writers can only dream about: to be able to write in your mind, constructing your whole novel in your mind and then, only then, write it down.  The Glass Bead Game is a masterpiece.
 
Its more or less the same with programmers and mathematicians: thinking about some specific problem all the time.
 
As Terry Pratchett said: If you stay true to
yourself, follow your dreams, reach for the stars and never stop wishing youll still get beaten by the people who got off their butts and worked hard.
 
I think its exactly the opposite: stop wishing, become wishless.  Can you really do nothing?  Its so easy and yet so hard.
You always have to be talented, you always need something you are good at, otherwise youre worth nothing.  Thats really sad and I am glad that the works of people like Laozi, Krishnamurti, Lun Yu, etc, got translated, am glad that we have people practicing Zen and Daoism.  You certainly dont change the world with code.  The best way to change the world is not to change it.  It will change automatically the moment you change yourself; the moment you change the way you think, the way you treat people, the moment you begin to love everything, every human, every tree, every bird, even an empty plastic bag flying through the wind: everythings just beautiful.
 
Writers, philosophers, gurus just had and have a way greater impact on the way I think, the way I live, the way I act.  vi never had such a great impact on me, the BSDs never had such a great impact on me.  You just cant compare it, cant compare anything.

This is totally false. Among great writers William Carlos Williams (doctor) and Wallace Stevens (VP for Hartford Insurance) come to mind; there are many others. Donald Knuth is a remarkable writer who doesnt usually work for a mass audience, but his lucid style is inextricable from his excellence as a computer scientist. And Oliver Sacks is highly competent both as a neurologist and writer.
 
Writer and Programmer are superclasses. Multiple inheritance can lead to complexity, but it can be pretty handy, too (or so Ive heard; I mostly program in XSLT).

Funny, I think I am not good at anything.  When I sat down and tried to write a book, I failed.  It was just too hard for me, especially with having all those books in mind that touched me.  I guess I am just to illiterate for that stuff.
 
This also reminded me of Jeff Dike, author of User Mode Linux, who said that [f]or me, writing the book was much harder than writing code. Writing prose comes much less naturally to me than writing code. On top of that, writing a book comes with other constraints such as meeting a schedule and making sure that everything you write is well-structured at all levels, from correct spelling and grammar to the manuscript being a consistent and coherent whole. (See http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/06/interview-with-jeff-dike-creator-of.html)
 
I think that if one lacks the motivation, anything  one tries out, like writing, painting, coding, , is doomed to fail.  At least thats what my experience says.
 
Somewhat belated: all the best for 2007 to you all!

Why would you care what Godfrey Hardy thinks?  I think he just wants to stand people up on pedestals and say Oh look, a great dead white European male!  Adulate!  But whats the point of adulating?  It really just begs the question.
 
Why would you want to be great anything?  Someone somewhere along the line will have issues with whether you were great or not and in the end it will all end up in some textbook read to teenagers bored out of their minds with having to learn about American history (American history just isnt bloody enough to be worth learning!).  Why not just do what you want?
 
Or what Im suggesting is that what a person truly wants is probably a better measure of what they should be doing than what is considered great.

I like writing too, especially fiction.  I thought programming would be more powerful in some sense than it ended up being; 16 years later I found out that it wasnt as good as I originally thought it would be.  But its still nice for solving certain problems and helping do research or whatever; I mean its not a total loss.  Whereas writing is the universal solvent, its beautiful.
 
Now I guess I personally dont quit programming because I also like programming and if I had all the time in the world to spend on writing Id still want to do some programming!  (The logic being that the grass is always greener and when youre worn out with one thing, something else looks more fun, so to avoid oscillating I just choose both).

Its tangential, but I couldnt pass this up - the first commenter, Joseph Knecht, writes:
 
As to your distaste for programming, Ill quote Dijkstra: programming is to computer science as telescopes are to astronomy. Do you have the same distaste and aversion for computer science?
 
This analogy seems sorely flawed to me.  Computer science facilitates programming; if there were no programs to be written, there would be no need of CS.  Telescopes, OTOH, facilitate astronomy.  Without telescopes it would be very, very hard to do astronomy.  Programming is to CS much more as composition is to music theory.
 
Which is not to say that programmers are better than computer scientists (or that music theorists are redundant) or that programming is what Aaron should do, like it or not.  Just that programming is not really at all like a telescope.

Just do what you love. Period. Ive had times in my life when that was programming - and it got me a long way, and I loved doing it while I did it. Then I felt the challenge of learning how to build a business. So I made a choice, and stepped away from coding, and started pursuing my passion of building businesses. Theres nothing wrong with your passions changing - think of it as opportunities to learn new skills.
 
One of the funny (paradoxical?) results of this is that Ive had my eyes opened on things that Id love to code. So, Ive gotten passionate about programming again. Aint life funny?
 
You dont need to apologize for being honest and self-examining - you only need to apologize if you arent following your love and passion.

Learning is like compound interest. A little bit of knowledge makes it easier to pick up more. Knowing what addition is and how to do it, you can then read a wide variety of things that use addition, thus knowing even more and being able to use that knowledge in a similar manner.5 And so, the growth in knowledge accelerates.

Title: Introducing feeds.reddit
 
Over the past few weeks, Ive been working on another new project. I think its finally time to tell people about it and what better place to start then here? So heres the site:
 
feeds.reddit.com
 
The idea is that its a more social web feed (RSS) reader. First, its got a great interface for reading feeds over the Internet  it has key commands (see the faq) that let you easily breeze through stories while keeping track of what youve read and havent read. Then theres a simple URL you can go to any time, anywhere (I visit it from my phone) to see stories you havent read yet.
 
Second, just like on reddit, you can vote on items you like a lot. This will go towards creating a list of the most popular items but it will also train a recommendations system to try to find other items and other feeds that youll probably like as well.
 
The problem is that building this stuff up requires users. So I hope youll try it out. Its got one-click import from Bloglines and imports OPML files from any other feed reader, so theres no harm in trying it out.
 
Let me know what you think.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

A few observations  Importing XML is painfully slow. The grouping of feeds (from a bloglines XML) is ignored. It would be nice if you could bulk edit the feeds, so you could, for example, delete all of them at once. Deleting individually is prohibitively slow.
 
More generally, I would be interested in using a feed reader that allows me to structure feeds so that I can read them in the order I wish, like bloglines. The Google reader style interface that tries to predict what Id like to read next is IMHO  wrong headed. Im surprised and disappointed that Google got it so wrong, maybe its something that reddit can do right 
 
The order I read feeds is not something that a program could predict unless it gets a direct line to my gray matter. I need a way to get a quick overview of all my feeds, and all the unread articles that are in them, then I choose how to start browsing. I might, for example see an article header that is very interesting to me, and then purposefully ignore it for a week because I know that when I read it I want to give it the attention it deserves, not just scan it and blow it away. This sort of thing is going to wreak havoc with readers that feed things up to me in algorithmically sorted orders. However, I can imagine marking articles up and down when I read them so that they can feed back into reddit proper.

====================================================

Title: The Conservative Nanny State
 

 
For years, progressives have watched as both Democratic and Republican administrations have taken away what little remained of economic liberalism in this country. Bill Clinton, for example, took away what meager assistance the government paid to poor single mothers, signed NAFTA, and begun attempting to chip away at Social Security.
 
But even worse than these policy defeats are the conceptual defeats that underly them. As cognitive scientist George Lakoff has argued people think about politics through conceptual moral frames, and the conservatives have been masterful at creating frames for their policies. If the left wants to fight back, theyre going to have to create frames of their own.
 
Enter Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and one of the people instrumental in fighting back against the most recent attempt to privatize social security (as author Social Security: The Phony Crisis he had plenty of facts to demonstrate that the crisis was, in fact, phony). He has a new book out, The Conservative Nanny State: How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay Rich and Get Richer, which takes decades of conservative frames and stands them on their head. (Disclosure: I liked the book so much I converted it to HTML for them and was sent a free paperback copy in return.)
 
His most fundamental point is that conservatives are not generally in favor of market outcomes. For far too long, he argues, the left has been content with the notion that conservatives want the market to do what it pleases while liberals want some government intervention to protect people from its excesses.
 
No way!, says Baker. Conservatives love big government  only they use it to give money to the rich instead of the poor. Thus the conservative nanny state of the title, always looking out for crybaby moneybags to help.
 
Take, for example, trade policy. The conservative nanny state is more than happy to sign free trade agreements that let manufacturing jobs in the United States flee offshore. And theyre happy to let immigrant workers come into the country to replace dishwashers and day laborers. But when it comes to the professional class, like doctors, lawyers, economists, journalists, and other professionals, oh no!, the conservative nanny state does everything it can (through licensing and immigration policy) to keep foreign workers out.
 
This doesnt just help the doctors, it hurts all of us because it means we have to pay more for health care. NAFTA boosters estimate that the entire agreement saved us $8 billion dollars a year. Using competition to bring only doctors salaries down the levels seen in Europe would save us eighty billion dollars  nearly $700 per family per year, just from improved prices for doctors. Youd see similar amounts from other major professions.
 
Bakers book is also one of the few to reveal the shocking secret behind the Federal Reserve Board you always hear messing with interest rates on the news. This unaccountable technocracy, most of whose members are appointed by banks, uses its power over interest rates to drive the economy into a recession so that wages wont get too high. Thats right, the government tries to slow down the economy so that you get paid less. (Full details are in the book.)
 
Bakers book is also chock-full of fascinating new policy ideas. He points out, for example, that corporations arent part of the free market, but instead a gift offered by the government. (A very popular one too, since companies voluntarily pay $278B each year for it.) And because of this, theres absolutely no reason the government cant tweak its terms to make us all better off. For example, Baker points out that currently, corporate rules count shareholders who dont vote at all as voting in favor of whatever the directors of the corporation prefer. Baker suggests requiring that all CEO pay packages get approved by a majority of those actually voting, instead of letting major CEOs pick how much to pay themselves as they do now.
 
Or what about copyright and patents? Again, this isnt a law of nature, but a big government gift. People who really care about shrinking government would want to try to get rid of or shrink the laws that say the government gets to make rules about what songs and movies we can have on our personal computers.
 
Americans spend $220 billion on prescription drugs, largely because of government-granted patents. Instead of handing that money to big drug companies, the government could spend far less (only a couple hundred million) funding researchers itself and making the resulting drug discoveries free to the public. College students spend $12 billion. Again, the government could make free textbooks for one-thousandth that. And we spend $37 billion on music and movies. Why not create an artistic freedom voucher (vouchers  a conservative favorite!) that can only be spent on artists who place their work in the public domain?
 
None of these would require outlawing the existing system  they could work side-by-side, simply forcing the existing drug, textbook, and movie companies to compete with this alternate idea. If their version works better, then fine, theyll get the money. But if not, therell be no conservative nanny state to protect them.
 
Similarly, the government could expand the social security program, allowing every to buy additional personal accounts from a system with amazingly low overhead (.5% versus the 20% of private funds) and a 70-year track record of success. Or it could try to improve our pitifully-bad health care system by letting people buy into the governments Medicare program, which again has amazingly low administrative costs (did you know that, on a per person basis, we spend 80% of what Britain spends on health care altogether simply on administration?) and serious bargaining power to push down prices. Again, why not let the private companies try their best to compete?
 
The book itself also discusses bankruptcy laws, torts and takings, small businesses, and taxes. And it goes in to far more detail on each of these subjects. And its all available for free on the Internet, so theres no excuse for not reading it. Its an fun read, the kind of book that turns the way you think about the economy upside-down.

Aaron,
 
Did you read this over before posting it?  I love your blog, but this post is just plain muddled thinking.
 
Thats right, the government tries to slow down the economy so that you get paid less. - as you say, full details are in the book, but youre going to have to back this one up if you want to repeat it.  Economic recessions are generally accompanied by loses in the equity markets, so the claim that the capitalist class is making out like bandits by stalling the economy is highly suspect.
 
He points out, for example, that corporations arent part of the free market, but instead a gift offered by the government. (A very popular one too, since companies voluntarily pay $278B each year for it.)  Surely you can see how ridiculous this statement is.  If you pay for something, it isnt a gift.  Could I say that Houses are gifts, and very popular ones, since people will voluntarily pay up to one million dollars (or more) for them!
 
Im no fan of big pharma, but the paragraph about patents is bunk.  It isnt simply a hand-out - companies are required to disclose inventions in order to receive patents, which means that they have to contribute to public knowledge.  Without patent law, companies would keep their designs secret to avoid competition.  Now, theres no question that patent law can (and often is) abused, but its not a one-sided thing at all.
 
Similarly, the government could expand the social security program, allowing every to buy additional personal accounts from a system with amazingly low overhead (.5% versus the 20% of private funds)  This is just plain bullshit.  Only hedge funds routinely have expense ratios or costs of 20%.  Typical mutual funds have expense ratios of between 1 and 2 percent, and anybody with a couple grand to invest can buy excellent index funds from vanguard with expense ratios way below 0.5%.  Im not contesting the point that the attempt to privatize social security was an attempt to move huge amounts of american paychecks into the hands of wall street investment banks, but the claim that the average private fund has 20% overhead is utterly ludicrous.
 
Again, I agree with the larger point, that corporate welfare is totally out of hand, but you should really do some fact-checking on this stuff.

Theres a link to the book at the end of the post. The relevant chapter is the one titled The Workers are Gettting Uppity: Call In the Fed!. Further details are available in the book Wall Street (also available online) and a particularly interesting case study is in Christian Parentis Lockdown America. Robin Hahnels book The ABCs of Political Economy also discusses this, noting that its in general probably also harmful to the capitalist class, but apparently you have to put class warfare first sometimes.
 
I agonized over rewording, but I decided to use the terms used in the book for consistencys sake.
 
I never said it was. What I said was that we could get far more efficient outcomes using a different system.
 
Privatized social security in Britain and Chile have administrative costs of this amount (ch. 9, fn. 2), as do private insurers who issue annuities, which seems like the appropriate comparison to a system like social security (ch. 9, fn. 3).

Aaron, you might make some distinctions here. Conservatives is a rather broad-brush label. I agree with you if you were to change this to neo-Conservatives (vs. paleos, i.e., Burkean or Kirkian conservatives).
 
This is a good read in the same vein as your article: http://www.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/conservative-hoax.html (though Rockwell, more of a libertarian than anything) also conflates the Conservative label with neo-Cons.

The fact that very inefficient systems exist is not a knock against the private investment sector in general.  (Which, as I said, provides options that are more efficient than the social security system).  You cant criticize a category by picking on the worst exemplar(s) of that category.

Look, social security is an annuity, that provides a guaranteed rate consistently until you die. It makes absolutely no sense to say that theres something else sold by the private market that has lower administration costs. You have to compare annuities to annuities.

Okay, thats a fair point.
 
So, I spent 5 minutes looking for private, fixed-rate annuities, and found one (http://personal.fidelity.com/products/annuities/income/freedom.shtml.cvsr) that has 0.6% charges and roughly 0.85% overhead.  Granted, thats about 3x the overhead of SS, but its a hell of lot less than your FUD figure of 20%, and this is also the absolute first fixed-rate annuity I found.  Presumably a bit of shopping around would get you a lower rate.

The 20% number is based on a 1999 study that took the results of a survey of annuity prices and averaged the costs of the lowest 10 rates.

Hmm, 70-year track record of success? Have you read the fairly widespread reports that the SSA is effectively bankrupt? Mostly because Congress cant keep its hands out of the money set aside for SSA, but whatever the reason, it doesnt look like much of a success in the near future.
 
I, for one (51 years old) expect not a penny from the SSA when Im older.

.5% versus the 20% of private funds is not reasonable.
 
I think somebody mixed-up two numbers with different bases. I suspect they were trying to say something like SS has an amazingly low overhead, 0.5%, [while the higher overhead of private funds] leads to an overall 20% less return over the expected life.
 
That is, if the return is 5%, and expenses are 1%, thats 20% of the return.
 
Corporations are not laws of nature. They are indeed a gift offered by the government, in the sense that in modern form they are very recent legal constructs, and the rules under which they operate have diverged greatly from their original public interest conception.
 
I think the point about patents is that its a bit of inconsistency to be talking about the Nanny State, then wanting men with guns to enforce a country-wide prohibition on how to do a certain action based on someone claiming they own that knowledge. Ideologically, once you allow such drastic social engineering for the interests of, e.g. pharmaceuticals, well, why not for having a minimum wage? What distinguishes the social interest of the factory-owner from the social interest of the factory-worker? (obviously, theres certain replies, but it does point out some problems with a slogan of small government).
 
Heck, right now, the Liberbabblers are trying to figure out if prohibitions on circumvention of access controls represent the good property-protecting government, or the bad intrusive-to-peoples-lives government. Amusingly, or not, the answers seem to be tracking who get big corporate money pretty closely.

Some of these seem half-plausible, but the accusations about the Fed are just plain silly. Inflation is far more harmful to an economy than a recession (or slow growth, as we usually see) and so it makes perfect sense for economic policy to err on the more conservative side. If you look at the rate of economic expansions and contractions compared to before the Fed had real teeth, youll see theyre actually doing an amazing job at guiding something which is inherently extremely difficult to influence.

Perhaps you should talk to some middle-class folks about their experiences with inflation during the 70s.  I wasnt alive then either, but I have yet to hear anyone wax economically nostalgic for that period.

Economists generally agree inflation is bad, but for different reasons.
 
I personally think a little bit of inflation is historically healthy, but too much or mismatched expectations is deadly. (Otherwise every country in the world would just print more and more money to grow their economy.) Every creditor factors inflation into their lending, based on reasonable exceptations. If inflation outpaces that and creates financial incertainty about the future value of money banks, people, and companies are less likely to invest. Anybody who saves is punished, as are people on fixed incomes, and it encourages financial speculation. Real incomes of people fall. Things like wages, taxes, and menu prices are slower to adjust.

I just skimmed the book and found it generally intellectually dishonest and misleading.  The only parts that were somewhat on-target were the ones about how some well-off groups, like small businesses, have wrangled benefits from the government.  You need to read more about some of these topics, Aaron, I dont think youve thought critically enough about them.  For example, suggesting that companies should compete against medicare or social security is such a bogus argument.  Those government programs can compel people to pay whatever prices they want and then raise taxes further if they dont have enough money.  No private enterprise has that kind of power.
 
Also, one crucial argument that is ignored by these anti-privatization schemes is that innovation is spurred by letting people own their work and make whatever they can get from it.  If you instituted the public domain music system you describe, I suspect that it would attract only the mediocre or young artists.  As soon as one of the young ones hit it big, he would move to a record label that copyrighted his work.  Your good friend Paul Graham makes a similar point in his essay Inequality and Risk (http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html).

Thats only true for fixed-rate loans; for floating credit, like credit cards, its a disaster.
As Matt seemed to be about to say, the prospect of inflation makes credit less likely, which probably harms both the potential lender and the potential debtor.

====================================================

Title: The Book That Changed My Life
 
Two years ago this summer I read a book that changed the entire way I see the world. I had been researching various topics  law, politics, the media  and become more and more convinced that something was seriously wrong. Politicians, I was shocked to discover, werent actually doing what the people wanted. And the media, my research found, didnt really care much about that, preferring to focus on such things as posters and polls.
 
As I thought about this more, its implications struck me as larger and larger. But I still had no bigger picture to fit them in. The media was simply doing a bad job, leading people to be confused. We just had to pressure them to do better and democracy would be restored.
 
Then, one night, I watched the film Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media (I think it had come up in my Netflix queue). First off, its simply an amazingly-good film. Ive watched it several times now and each time Im utterly entranced. Its undoubtedly the best documentary Ive seen, weaving together all sorts of clever tricks to enlighten and entertain.
 
Second, it makes shocking points. I didnt understand all of what it was saying at the time, but I understood enough to realize that something was severely amiss. The core of the film is a case study of Indonesias brutal invasion of the country of East Timor. The US personally gave the green light to the invasion and provided the weapons, which allowed Indonesia to massacre the population in an occupation that, per capita, ranks with the Holocaust. And the US media ignores it and when they do cover it, inevitably distorts it.
 
Shocked and puzzled by the film, I was eager to learn more. Noam Chomsky has dozens of books but I was fortunate to choose to read Understanding Power, a thick paperback I picked up at the library. Edited by Peter Mitchell and John Schoeffel, two public defenders in New York, the book is a collection of transcripts of group discussions with Chomsky.
 
Chomsky lays out the facts in a conversational style, telling stories and explaining things in response to questions from the groups, covering an incredibly wide range of topics. And on every single one, what he tells you is completely shocking, at odds with everything you know, turning the way you see things upside-down. Mitchell and Schoeffel know youre unlikely to believe these things, so theyve carefully footnoted and documented every claim, providing blockquote excerpts from the original sources to establish them.
 
Each story, individually, can be dismissed as some weird oddity, like what Id learned about the media focusing more on posters than on policy. But seeing them all together, you cant help but begin to tease out the larger picture, to ask yourself whats behind all these disparate things, and what that means for the way we see the world.
 
Reading the book, I felt as if my mind was rocked by explosions. At times the ideas were too much that I literally had to lie down. (Im not the only one to feel this way  Norman Finkelstein noted that when he went through a similar experience, It was a totally crushing experience for me.  My world literally caved in. And there were quite a number of weeks where  I just was in bed, totally devastated.) I remember vividly clutching at the door to my room, trying to hold on to something while the world spun around.
 
For weeks afterwards, everything I saw was in a different light. Every time I saw a newspaper or magazine or person on TV, I questioned what I thought knew about them, wondered how they fit into this new picture. Questions that had puzzled me for years suddenly began making sense in this new world. I reconsidered everyone I knew, everything I thought Id learned. And I found I didnt have much company.
 
Its taken me two years to write about this experience, not without reason. One terrifying side effect of learning the world isnt the way you think is that it leaves you all alone. And when you try to describe your new worldview to people, it either comes out sounding unsurprising (yeah, sure, everyone knows the medias got problems) or like pure lunacy and people slowly back away.
 
Ever since then, Ive realized that I need to spend my life working to fix the shocking brokenness Id discovered. And the best way to do that, I concluded, was to try to share what Id discovered with others. I couldnt just tell them it straight out, I knew, so I had to provide the hard evidence. So I started working on a book to do just that. (Im looking for people to help, if youre interested.)
 
Its been two years now and my mind has settled down some. Ive learned a bunch more but, despite my best efforts, havent found any problems with this frightening new world view. After all this time, Im finally ready to talk about what happened with some distance and I hope Im now able to begin work on my book in earnest.
 
It was a major change, but I wouldnt give it up for anything.

Famously, so. Your allergic reaction to Chomsky is a classic, although I cant help but wonder if things would have been different had you picked a more scholarly or at least footnoted work instead of What Uncle Sam Really Wants which isnt really written by Chomsky (its sort of a hodge-podge of transcribed comments mixed together by others) and isnt very good.

Well, youre also in an economics department. ;-) But the point I understand Chomsky to be making here is the same as the one Dean Baker makes in his latest (and quite good) book The Conservative Nanny State  namely, that corporations and governments push for constraints on the free market all the time, while pretending otherwise. The wording may be a little hyperbolic, but perhaps you can cut him some slack considering theyre off-the-cuff remarks.

The Holocaust, Cambodia, Sudan, Vietnam, Indonesia  heres a list of the last-century genocides:

Not to pick nits, but a simple front-page article would not have saved thousands of lives.  As evidence, witness Darfur.  Darfur is constantly in the news and has been the subject of Presidential speeches and Congressional resolutions.  There is a semi-popular movement to raise money for Darfur by selling the Livestrong-type bracelets.  Awareness is present, but so far no UN troops are and the killing continues.
 
The greatest crime is that we are more aware of modern genocides and yet still do nothing.  Millions of people protested the war in Iraq.  Why have they suddenly fallen silent on Darfur?

When I was a teenager, a friend gave me a copy of his latest book, After the Cataclysm, my first encounter with Chomsky. I was mostly puzzled, struggling to make sense of its convoluted exposition, but feeling much the same sense of disorientation at what appeared to be a parallel reality that required jettisoning a lot of what I thought I knew. Of course, Im now glad it failed to make a lasting impression.  Ive said a lot of really stupid things in my lifetime, but Im happy to say accounts of genocide by the Khmer Rouge are systematically exaggerated and only serve the interests of the American power structure aint one of them.
 
While I think I understand your reaction, it still raises some obvious red flags. Its one thing to have read a book that changed your life, fine, a lot of us have. But when you say your mind was rocked by explosions and that you literally had to lie down, that tells me youre responding to these ideas on far more than an intellectual level. While a few books of nonfiction have greatly impressed me and even brought me to tears, Ive never come close to what youre describing. This is how Id expect an especially sensitive person to talk while in the throes of the raptures of poetry, or in the midst of a visionary religious experience. I mean, did you really clutch the door to your room, trying to hold onto something while the world spun around? To be fair, you seem to be aware this may come off as a bit odd. But to be honest, I think youre having a great time with all this despite complaints of isolation; after all, you know something important that most other people seem incapable of recognizing. Not exactly like taking a shot of olive oil to lose weight, but close.

I cant find your alleged exact quote, but I know the issue. To try to short-circuit a classic flame-war: Nobody in politics is always right, especially in attempting to figure out whats going on amidst a mass of disinformation propaganda, with a horde of fanatical flamers dogging them for every misstep.
 
Chomsky is extremely unusual since he has a very analytical mind, and then attempts to apply it to the real world. Thats about the best one can do in life.

Ill repeat the question I asked earlier: when you say you remember vividly clutching at the door to [your] room, trying to hold on to something while the world spun around when contemplating Chomskys ideas, are you really being accurate? Im inclined to think not, and that youre being a bit dramatic to emphasize your point. But if so, it suggests a high degree of disorientation, a condition in which I doubt much measured, critical reasoning is possible. It sounds like your floodgates are down, frankly. I understand the sort of expansive intellectual experience one gets from reading about mathematics, and the occasional feeling of having to put a book down to allow more time to absorb its insights, but this sounds more like an upheaval. In particular, what Norman Finkelstein describes sounds alarmingly like a nervous collapse: in bed for weeks, he says, his world literally [sic] caved in. Mind you, this is not an author who revels in gruesome accounts of war and genocide that might especially trigger such a reaction; Chomskys prose is highly analytical and dry as a bone. The upshot is I find both these accounts remarkable.
 
BTW, re your email note: I thought the quote I offered was clearly a composite intended to represent what I might parrot after reading that book, but at any rate, its as accurate a single-sentence summary as can be. If you havent read it already, I insincerely recommend it.

I read Manufacturing Consent, and saw the documentary, several years ago, and while my experience was not so emotionally charged, I can attest that it is an eye-opening and paradigm-breaking experience.
 
I think, though, that youve neglected to mention Chomskys basic thesis: that the U.S. media, far from being scrappy and independent, very closely parrots the preferred world-view of the politically and economically powerful. The core of the movie is not just an analysis of the tragedy in East Timor, nor the U.S.s support. East Timor is paired (with Cambodia, if I remember correctly) as an illustration of the basic thesis: while East Timor was being decimated and the U.S. media took a pro-Polynesian line (in line with the official U.S. government line), an almost identical tragedy was receiving very different press coverage in the U.S. (Cambodia, or wherever, was recognized and denounced as a tragedy).
 
The book offers perhaps a dozen such paired examples: client states of the U.S. commit an atrocity, and get praised; client states of a U.S. enemy commit an almost identical atrocity and are denounced as monsters. In every case, the media follows the party line of the U.S. political and economic elite.
 
Its a compelling argument, yet very difficult to validate, at least for this reader. It certainly places both liberal and conservative criticisms of the bias of the media in a new light: theyre both wrong.

But I think discarding a large set of beliefs (a world-view) entails letting in a whole lot of others, which everyone needs in order to make it through the day.
 
Well, maybe we can proceed by you pointing out which of those beliefs is wrong. Its hard to respond to some of your beliefs may be wrong; an obvious fact.
 
For one thing, theres the powerful but largely unfalsifiable idea that things are not as they seem, that there are shadowy figures who are adept at pulling the wool over our eyes.
 
Thats unfalsifiable? Chomsky doesnt simply claim such things, instead he writes deeply factual books filled with careful studies of which this might be a conclusion. He points to the people of power whose job is to do this and quotes their own writings where they describe it in this way. In short, he provides evidence, which can be evaluated on its merits.
 
But when something bad happens in the world, a common response is to play up this American angle to the hilt, while ignoring other possibly more malevolent forces.
 
You seem to fail to lack a fundamental principle of morality, namely, youre primarily responsible for your own actions. Yes, this principle is uncomfortable but I think its also uncontestable. If I kill a man and then say I killed him, would you complain that I play up this [personal] angle to the hilt, while ignoring other possibly more malevolent forces [like the fact that I was on drugs at the time]?
 
This is not the place for a long discussion on Cambodia, but your apparent standard that if someone is ever wrong about something it extinguish[es their] credibility and makes further enthusiasm for them irrational seems an awfully high bar. Can you name a single public figure who has never been wrong about anything?

This is quite insufficient. While we are responsible for our actions, intellectuals are additionally and especially responsible for sorting out the objective truth, that would help guide our actions. But I am just echoing Bruce Sharps point:
 
Certainly there is merit to the idea that we should be more concerned with our own morality, rather than that of our enemies. But the wider implications of this seem to be lost on many of Chomskys supporters: If we admire Chomsky  if his viewpoint is our viewpoint  then we should be deeply concerned with ensuring that it is fair and accurate.
 
Im actually not able to make much sense of your example. First, it involves only two parties (you and the guy you kill) rather a third (China or Russia), which was the point I was getting at. I also find it difficult to consider that your being on drugs is more malevolent than murdering him while sober. So that code doesnt even compile. How about you punch a guy in the face, and later he dies? How much effort should you put into agonizing over your moral status if between those two events, someone else came along and hit him on the head with a sledge hammer? Perhaps you are morally culpable on some level, but you need all the information first.
 
This is not the place for a long discussion on Cambodia, but your apparent standard that if someone is ever wrong about something it extinguish[es their] credibility and makes further enthusiasm for them irrational seems an awfully high bar. Can you name a single public figure who has never been wrong about anything?
 
I believe any fair reading of Sharps essay leads to a far more damning conclusion than that Chomsky was simply mistaken about some simple point of fact at any one time. (Mistakes go in many directions, bias in one.) Likewise, your quip about the 30 book reviews leads me to conclude that you have no substantial criticism of that essay. I mean, if this is the best you can do
 
A word on facts is in order here. Following my last comment, I became aware that you had earlier offered a cash prize for any factual errors in Chomskys published works. I re-read Sharps essay, assuming it would be easy to find a few. Actually, it wasnt. While the misrepresentations of Shawcross and Sydney Schanberg come the closest to qualifying, and the Znet material is of course off-limits, Chomskys real errors are those of profound bias. Consider that there are no factual errors whatsoever in the maddeningly encapsulated paragraph marked with footnote #111, despite the monstrousness of its enclosed assertions.
 
And clearly no, this is not a place for a long discussion on Chomskys views on Cambodia, since that argument has already taken place at length. I will note, however, one point of Sharps that resonates for me personally. Even I was aware, albeit obliquely, of negative media coverage of the American bombing campaign in Cambodia, despite being eight years old at the time. It was one of the reasons my parents were furious with Nixon, and thrilled to see him resign soon afterwards. (After all, it was not just Watergate that labeled him a criminal.) They seemed to form this view on a steady diet of the NY Times and the evening news.
 
By contrast, even as I became older and politically sensitive I had only the dimmest idea of what happened in Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge took over. Even after the Vietnamese invasion, when the genocide was fully revealed to the world, I was only aware there was some sort of controversy about the matter. Maybe it was the teen hormones starting to kick in and addle my brain, but it just wasnt front and center. Indeed, it was precisely to figure out what had happened in the region that I took up Chomskys book in the first place, as I mentioned in my first comment. I was especially drawn to the book because he was a well-known commenter on the region. Had I known what really happened, I wouldnt have made it more than a few pages in before throwing down the book in disgust.
 
Of course one account does not make for a careful study, but it doesnt seem likely these responses would be possible if there were a highly effective and monolithic system of propaganda in place minimizing Americas culpability in the region, while at the same time demonizing the Khmer Rouge. The continued assertion otherwise is one of the many reasons I find Chomsky so unreasonable, my original point.

If Chomsky was indeed not telling the truth, that would be a serious charge, but youd have to provide some evidence for it. Which is why I created the challenge.
 
That 30 books error isnt the only error in the piece, but its the only one I got him to correct.
 
Chomskys real errors are those of profound bias. Consider that there are no factual errors whatsoever in the maddeningly encapsulated paragraph marked with footnote #111, despite the monstrousness of its enclosed assertions.
 
I dont see how its assertions are monsterous. Its a suggestion of a reasonable possibility. Perhaps, you may argue, a possibility completely at odds with the facts we know now, but nonetheless a possibility.
 
I read Chomsky because he provides facts that no one else does. If his facts are correct, why should I stop reading?

That 30 books error isnt the only error in the piece, but its the only one I got him to correct.
 
Whats laughable here is that in your challenge, you require us to supply material errors, those that are relevant to the point [Chomsky is] making, not a typo or a misspelling, the kind we all make. What kind of error is this one youre describing? That it was actually 33 rather than 30 books, or that they were reviewed in the New York Review of Books rather than the New York Times? How does either revelation alter the substance of Sharps point?
 
I dont see how its assertions are monsterous. Its a suggestion of a reasonable possibility. Perhaps, you may argue, a possibility completely at odds with the facts we know now, but nonetheless a possibility.
 
No, actually its a possibility completely at odds with facts that were well established in 1979, when After the Cataclysm went to press. Hence the device in which he offers a positive review of a nonexistent book: its a series of statements that clearly cant stand as a direct assertion.  And of course its nominally true the Khmer Rouge programs [may have] elicited a positive response from some sectors of the Cambodian peasantry, so long as as at least one peasant benefitted in any way. But this is nothing but dissembling double-talk. After all, Germanys invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 elicited a positive response from some Russians.
 
(BTW, we have now just established the intellectual integrity of the Bush administration, since the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a reasonable possibility in 2003, or a suggestion thereof. Charges of systematic bias are unfounded.)
 
I read Chomsky because he provides facts that no one else does. If his facts are correct, why should I stop reading?
 
Need I repeat for you the difference between being nominally correct on a specific set of factual matters and being intellectually honest? And by no means am I asking you to stop reading him. I am asking you to read him more critically. And yes, I have provided evidence that Chomsky has been far less than truthful.

Im not sure why were spending so much time on an aside, but it does seriously affect his point. He was claiming that the mainstream media lavished attention on the subject  the NYT reviewed 30 books! Well, actually, it was the New York Review of Books, a completely different outlet which published Chomsky in those days. So its hardly mainstream attention at all and his point is just wrong.
 
If you agree that Chomsky is factually correct, then I dont see what we have to discuss.

While no doubt lower circulation than the Times, the NYRB was still a highly influential publication, and quite revered in the circles I grew up in, perhaps on par with The New Yorker, albeit less entertaining. But no matter. The salient point is that there were well over two dozen books on the market that might support the idea that Americas bombing of Cambodia was a war crime. Not, say, the one or two you might expect for an issue pushed out to the margins in an atmosphere of pervasive propaganda. So I still dispute its relevance.
 
If you agree that Chomsky is factually correct, then I dont see what we have to discuss. Since, characteristically, you responded to one part of my prior comment, you cant not have read the other part.

What I find strange is that youre so into Noam Chomsky and yet you support capitalism (Or at least this has been my impression).  Chomsky is an anarchist and he doesnt simply advocate policy reform but radical change to society.

Im not sure if Chomsky is really an anarchist, since Ive heard him (self?) described as an anarchist socialist, which strikes me as an oxymoron. But theres no particular conflict between anarchism and capitalism, from what I understand, the latter term understood as less power ceded to government.

Aaron, I note in your replies both here and, more explicitly, at Mike Sierras aforementioned blog post your belief that (as you put it over in Mikes comments) you acknowledge that bias exists, but its a [] far less important [subject] than simple falsehood. I wonder if you could elaborate on the thinking that brought you to the decision that technical inaccuracy is a bigger problem than bias (either here, or in a new post). Just a thought, and thank you for engaging in dialogue.

Thats an interesting question. There are pragmatic reasons for not worrying about bias (its tough to define, its harder to prove, its not directly relevant, etc.) but you asked why I think its less of a problem. The reason is that its easier to combat.
 
Lets say I tell you that Joe found me sitting in a restaurant, sat down at my table, called me an idiot, ate some of the food Id ordered, and then left without paying for anything. It sounds pretty bad. But if I am biased but still honest, Joe can redeem himself simply by pointing out that he stumbled upon the restaurant by accident, I waved him over, he was joking about the idiot remark (and said it in a friendly way), I invited him to have some food, and he had to dash off to a meeting and offered to pay but I told him not to worry about it. In one simple sentence, the tale is totally turned around. Not do you side with Joe on the issue, but you also begin to trust me less.
 
By contrast, lets say I was outright lying. Joe could respond that the whole thing wasnt true, he never saw me in a restaurant, etc., but thats far less convincing. Now you know one of us is lying but youre not sure who and its tempting to just throw your hands up and not worry about it too much, or to simply take my word for it because Im your friend.
 
The implications for politics should be clear.
 
As for me, when people are merely biased I find it frustrating but not disastrous. I read a lot of stuff and Ill often get the other side of the story soon enough. But when people lie or consistently tell falsehoods  well, I find that extremely problematic and Ill try to avoid reading their stuff in the future, lest my brain get filled up with facts that simply arent true.

Ive felt the same way, although not from Chomskys books, though, no doubt, he provides a contrarian viewpoint and strikes many good points.
 
For me, it was back in the 80s, reading a book by Jonathan Kwitney (a former WSJ reporter) titled Endless Enemies, a real eye opening book that detailed American interventionalist follies around the world, and it made a big impression upon me, shattering the illusion that American foreign policy was based on lofty principles of freedom and justice. Instead, carnal money grubbing desires are at the root of political manuevers, and the U.S., while in relative terms, may be cleaner than other historical nations, has engaged in nefarious plots in service of monied interests.
 
Recently, another book I read shook me in a similar fashion - The Secret War Against the Jews by John Loftus. Not that I agreed with all the speculation offered by the author, based on his network of old spies, but much of the book chimed true with other works from ex-CIA/NSA insiders. Stuff that fits into follow the money paradigm of viewing world history.

I disagree that bias is easier to rectify.  Verifying facts involves focusing on a narrow set of assertions  whether Joe called you an idiot, left without paying, etc.  while identifying bias means you have to have a much wider scope of information available to you, which is inherently harder. Consider that if a reporter wrote up the story you initially presented, it would pass a fact-checker, but not an alert editor. Also consider that if you wrote a book called Joe is a Bad Man containing that set of facts, and you offered $50 to anyone able to identify a factual error in it, youd be able to keep your money.

Truly maddening. You said that bias is easier to combat, despite its more vague definition. By combat, I assume you mean to recognize bias, which allows us to correct for it, i.e., rectify.

Well, you assumed wrong. What I meant by combat should be clear from the example I gave: providing a response that fills in the gaps of the biased narrative, thus allowing the audience to get a less biased understanding of whats going on. No explicit recognition or rectification is necessary.

I actually believe were both talking about the same thing: the effect on the audience rather than on the source of the information. When you respond to the narrative by filling in the gaps, you implicitly recognize the information is incomplete, and you are doing something to rectify that shortcoming. Are we using the same language now? (Sheesh, and from a writer, no less!)
 
In your comment on my blog, you wondered to which of my points you failed to respond, and offered to rectify the situation. Perhaps here would be a good place to start. After I disagree that bias is easier to rectify, there are three other sentences. Are there any problems with any of them?

Mike Sierra now asks if the Chomsky challenge is a []reliable test for intellectual honesty considering it doesnt include the issue of bias. I never said it was; Im not even sure what intellectual honesty precisely means in this context. The Chomsky Challenge page explains what motivates the contest and its specific rules. Neither the word intellectual nor honest appears.
 
If Mike wants to define some rules for intellectual honesty and some tests for bias, perhaps we could discuss them and then apply them to various people. But, unlike the issue of factual errors (for which there are numerous formal procedures for identifying and correcting and so on), I cant say Ive seen any rules for proving intellectual dishonesty. Let me know if you have.

Yes, whatever. I was hoping to obtain a copy of Manufacturing Consent today, but none was available at my local library or book store, and Google hasnt scanned it. Can you (or anyone) tell me if the following passage appears on pp. 281-282?
 
In that article we were clear and explicit, as also subsequently, that refugee reports left no doubt that the record of Khmer Rouge atrocities was substantial and often gruesome, and that in the case of Cambodia, there is no difficulty in documenting major atrocities and oppression, primarily from the reports of refugees.

The passage quoted in my prior comment (#c38), which I believe would have passed your challenge, has been corrected in the 2002 edition. (The revised prose in that section is less than forthright, but thats a story for another day.) Im going on vacation for a week, and wanted to settle as much as I could before I left. Woe unto anyone else reading this, but here goes
 
Regarding your email from 6/3, yes, I share your frustration in our ability to communicate. One example: commenting on my blog on your state of knowledge about the Khmer Rouge, you said you werent following the news when it was a big story and  havent ever looked into it since. By big story, were you referring to Pol Pots death in 98, the recent effort to bring surviving leaders to justice, or were you unaware the Khmer Rouge were toppled years before you were born? The mere fact that you just sent me email referring to me repeatedly in the third person by my proper name, as if it were a public comment, was itself mildly disorienting.
 
In your #c29 comment, you only said you agreed that bias was difficult to define and to prove, an uncontroversial point. You said nothing that would lead me to believe you agreed with my statement noting the Chomsky challenges limitations in detecting bias, on which much dishonesty may be based. If you meant otherwise, you were unclear. I really had no idea what you were talking about.
 
Yes, bias may be accidental or intentional (as factual error can), and Im sorry if I interchanged the words bias and dishonesty in a confusing way. Still, the Joe Is a Bad Man counter-example I provided, the one to which you supposedly gave your assent, clearly represents dishonesty, since you would have been present at the encounter with Joe and thus well aware of reasons he called you an idiot and left without paying.
 
You still seem fixated on making hair-splitting distinctions among words like identify, combat, recognize, and rectify as they relate to bias, and I thought I had been as clear as possible that were talking about the same thing. Theres simply no way you can combat bias without implicitly recognizing/identifying a lack of relevant information in whatever set is being presented. That may just mean reading two articles rather than one.
 
As for rectify, the only misreading I could think of is to get a biased source to correct itself, a meaning I ruled out in my #c32 comment: to rectify is to correct the imbalanced set of information reaching the audience, to correct for the bias rather than correct it at the source. (I dont know if thats a source of misunderstanding.)
 
Regarding your #c35 comment, Im not suggesting in any way you should try to craft a Chomsky Challenge that might detect bias. Indeed, I think the difficulty in crafting such a test generally supports the notion that bias is a more difficult problem with which to grapple.
 
In your email you claimed I did not offer an argument backing up my observation that bias is harder to rectify. The argument I offered is a simple one: that validating facts requires far less information on hand than checking for bias, which requires familiarity with a wider range of relevant information. (To which I may add you need wisdom in weighing the sources.) While I appreciate the difficulties you mentioned that are involved in gathering facts, I get the strong impression the filters we put in place are more of a problem.

Thank you for the recommendation. Ive read some Chomsky and Ive put Understanding Power in the queue. Perhaps interestingly, the same thing - a sense of isolation and helplesness when it comes to communicating my newly found wisdom - happened to me after reading Gravitys Rainbow by Pynchon. Its a book Ive repeatedly heard lauded as a classic of literature, but turns out very few people have actually read it through and even less let themselves understand it.

Title: Public Service Announcement
 
These are sad days for American democracy. Ohio congressman Bob Ney took bribes of tens of thousands of dollars in contributions and gifts. California congressman Duke Cunningham is in jail after forfeiting $1.8 million in bribes. And Louisiana congressman William Jefferson is giving up $1 million in bribes after an FBI raid on his house found $90,000 in a freezer.
 
In these days of widespread corruption and bribery, it is important to remember that no, this is not how our great democracy is supposed to work. The bribery is supposed to be much more subtle  not to mention legal.

About the only way to reduce (and perhaps eliminate) these bribes (both to the elected officials and from them to special interests or the general population) is by reducing the scope of government to that envisioned in the Constitution.  If the federal government budget were say 0.1% of what it is today there would be much less influence peddling.  For more on this, read Harry Brownes Why Government Doesnt Work (http://www.libertyfree.com/WGDW/Chapter6.htm - sample chapter).

Title: Fat Backlash
 
They told me exercise and diet
If I would try it, would cure my ills
But though Im already past my quota
I want another load o those magic pills
  They Might Be Giants, Renew My Subscription
 
The response to my suggestion that there might be a simple and painless way to lose weight brought some interesting responses. Many people who wrote in were excited about it or were actually trying it. But some of the rest were downright hostile.
 
tuomov wrote:
 
No pain, no loss. Forget all these bullshit weight-loss manuals. Those four words above summarise all that you need to know. The rest is just pain management and scheduling. If you dont feel hungry occasionally, youre not losing weight.
 
And Martijn commented:
 
But how is this healthy? This diet sounds like a trick to fool your body. [] Why not just eat well? [] Somehow people want to lose weight the easy way, pff.. just prooves how lazy this McDonalds generation has become.
 
Such comments strike me as slightly odd. Eat better has been the diet advice for as long as I can remember and undoubtedly everyone overweight has heard it by now. And yet, as these writers clearly know, obesity is, as I understand it, an epidemic in this country. So this supposed solution clearly isnt working. Yes, it might work in the sense that if everyone followed it theyd be fine (although even that is somewhat unclear), but plainly its too hard to follow. If our goal is to actually stop obesity, then were failing.
 
But I suspect for some people, that isnt the goal. And Martijns last sentence hints at this. In my last piece I drew an analogy between being poor and being fat. And I think this rage at an easy way to lose weight parallels the rage we see at government handouts that provide an easy way out of being poor.
 
(To be clear, Im talking about people who are opposed to easy ways to lose weight in general; not the people who were skeptical about this diet in particular or sick of fad diets altogether. Such reactions are perfectly right and reasonable.)
 
This is one thing I didnt really predict in my last piece on the subject, but undoubtedly such far-reaching changes will also have their backlash. People who have spent their whole lives putting themselves through the pain of starvation and strenuous exercise to maintain their physique are undoubtedly going to be a little upset to figure out it was all unnecessary. It would be bad enough if it was some new invention that made fat disappear  after all, it hadnt been invented yet when theyd gone through all that so there was no way they could take advantage of it. But olive oil and sugar water? Thats been around forever! How could they have missed it?
 
Ronald Reagan got elected campaigning against imaginary welfare queens in supposed-Cadillacs. Will right-wing politicians of the future rail against those who take the easy way out of being fat?
 
One major difference is that economics is at least thought to be a zero-sum game. Those welfare queens are taking your money, in the form of taxes. But you lose nothing if more people get thin. By the same token, theres not a whole lot the government can do about this problem. The welfare payments were theirs, so they could cut them (as Clinton savagely did) but whats the government going to do about the diet? Ban olive oil?
 
Perhaps instead well see social pressure. The major visible difference between someone on the diet and someone who isnt (considering that the olive oil can be taken in private) is that someone whos on the diet simply doesnt eat much. But eating is a major social function, around which much business and friendship is conducted. Perhaps backlash members will heap scorn on those who skip lunch or eat little, perhaps even ostracizing them until they start eating like normal (and thus weakening the effects of the diet).
 
Ive seen a little bit of this myself  as a supertaster, my tastes are sufficiently strange that when eating with new people Im often asked about my choice of food and then queried and lightly mocked for my explanation. Its not so bad and Im sure people mean perfectly well by it, but it is a cost and if people are actually angry about the diet, it may get worse.
 
So while actually being fat may go away easily, the stigma might be a little harder to erase.

I think this Shangri-La thing is pretty interesting, and Ive tried some vegetable oil a couple hours before I run to see if it will work as blood sugar insurance. Its only been a few trials, and my blood sugar crashes are sort of unpredictable, but I think it might be helping.  Its often hard for me to time meals such that they leave me in a good state for running, so if the set point trick can make my body less susceptible to food ups and downs, Ill be very interested.
 
I cant help but wonder if your supertaster status ups the ante for the tastelessness of the oil. Do you have to get extra, extra, extra light olive oil? :)

You write: [Already-thin people] lose nothing if more people get thin.
 
That strikes me as naive.  Social status is positional.  A large increase in the number of thin people would decrease the social advantage that already-thin people have, in the past, either gotten for free (through genetics), or worked for (through exercise etc.), or both.  Once these people lose the advantage of thinness, theyll have to fall back on other qualities, e.g. an engaging personality or strength of character or whatever.
 
Although Im a cynic, so I believe that much of the social value currently placed on thinness would simply be displaced onto other physical traits, e.g. muscle tone.

The analogy is flawed in that wealth can easily be transfered from those who have it to those who dont, while weight itself cannot be so easily transfered (weight - not food).
 
Moreover, in the affluent West, weight-loss is high-status activity, which attracts much marketing, while poverty relief is the opposite, downright stigmatized these days in the US.
 
You really should entertain the idea that youre mistaken, and that people who have seen lots of fads come and go are correct.

Seth, regardless of whether the Shangri-La Diet hints at anything useful (Id be skeptical of any revolutionary diet advice that was published in a book before being published in a peer-reviewd journal), surely you see the parallelism in the moralism of why dont you just work your way out of poverty and why dont you just starve your way out of obesity?

Aaron, I think youre taking things the wrong way.  People are having a backlash because they are highly skeptical, something that should be regarded as a GOOD thing, not a bad one.  Time after time, weve seen revolutionary diets that are supposed to allow you to lose weight without even trying, and from the entries Ive seen you write about it, this Shangri-La diet doesnt seem to be any different.  Diets come and diets go, but the only thing that remains constant is the fact that when people go on these miracle diets, all they end up doing is losing a little bit of weight really fast, and then later end up putting all of it back on (if not more) because the diet really isnt sustainable (e.g.: Atkins diet).  The end effect of going on these diets is that people end up being worse off, not better off, because the diet just doesnt work.
 
I doubt that these people care whether or not the diet actually ends up working.  What theyre pissed off about is the fact that every few years, theres another doctor that comes around touting his new awesome diet thats guaranteed to work, and he gets millions of dollars of hapless people who buy his book and all the other accessories that go along with his book thinking that theyll finally lose weight.  And they end up spending lots of money and not permanently losing lots of weight.  Its annoying, and its insidious, and its predatory.  And it angers them to think that it might happen again.  Its a neverending cycle.
 
Now, dont mistake me for saying that the Shangri-La diet is another miracle diet that really doesnt work.  I dont have enough evidence to say that it does or doesnt work.  Its just that it has all the warnings of such a miracle diet.  One: an author publishes a book on the diet saying that it will help you lose weight without too much effort.  Two: the book is published without any scientific evidence in medical journals.  Three: it has a cool name thats supposed to inspire immediate confidence in the diet.  Four: the cure does not involve eating healthily and getting lots of exercise, but it involves some miracle substance which in this case is olive oil.
 
People are not backlashing at your entries because they dont want the diet to work.  I suspect that they would love it if it did.  But from all past experiences, the Shangri-La diet doesnt appear to have any better suggestions than any of the other previous miracle diets did.
 
If the Shangri-La diet takes the country by storm and makes obesity rates drop precipitously without any bad health side effects, I will be the first to say that that would be an awesome thing.  But Ill believe it when I see it.  And dont alienate your readers, Aaron, just because you think that theyre mad at this diet because they carefully managed what theyre eating and exercised a lot  that really has nothing to do with it.  Theyre just seeing another miracle diet coming along and right now, it looks to be just that, despite your own anecdotes.
 
By the way, eating healthy and getting lots of exercise isnt hard.  The hard thing is to start out doing this in life, not get bogged down into a habit of eating unhealthy foods.  For example, when I was growing up, my parents always cooked healthy food at home, used a wide variety of ingredients and always insisted that I try a little bit of each dish to make sure that I didnt like it.  As a result, I like eating a wide variety of foods, and I truly am disgusted when I see foods at fast food places which are fried and have grease dripping from the bottom.  I also have ridden my bike to school consistently since I was in elementary school (it takes 30 minutes), because my parents didnt want to be prisoner to having to drive me to school every day.  Not to say that I dont like eating ice cream or dessert, or that my parents havent driven me to school once in a while  its just that the DEFAULT is to eat well and get good exercise, and if I want to stray from that default every so often, I can easily do so.

Theres a difference between why dont you just work your way out of poverty and why dont you just starve your way out of obesity. Unless you are obese due to some disease, you can work your way out of obesity if you really decide to do so and can keep to that decision. Yes, I know that the latter part can be difficult, especially if you live a stressed life. But working your way out of poverty isnt up to you just deciding to do so and sticking to it. Even most rich people as individuals have very little control over the economy, let alone poor people. But you can have full control over what enters your gastrointestinal tract.

Did you not read what I wrote?  I quote from my previous post:
 
I doubt that these people care whether or not the diet actually ends up working. What theyre pissed off about is the fact that every few years, theres another doctor that comes around touting his new awesome diet thats guaranteed to work, and he gets millions of dollars of hapless people who buy his book and all the other accessories that go along with his book thinking that theyll finally lose weight. And they end up spending lots of money and not permanently losing lots of weight. Its annoying, and its insidious, and its predatory. And it angers them to think that it might happen again. Its a neverending cycle.

Frankly, the notion theres anything significantly new to this diet deserves a lot more hostility than youre getting. I reject sight unseen any diet named after Shangri-la (the Ph.D. after the guys name is just gravy), and Im willing to use the H-word rather than the fallback skepticism.
 
But even assuming the mechanism of the diet is proven to work, none of these predictions about revolutionary societal change follow. What actually happens is the book attracts hordes of fickle habitual dieters who seem to get their important lifestyle changes out of cereal boxes, who are as attached to the present set of requirements as to the last one.  And as soon as the highly motivated early adopters realize that their prescient  counterintuitive wisdom has become devalued now that everybody is repeating it around water coolers and bridge games, they move on to trumpet some other enthusiasm, perhaps homeopathy or Twizzlers. Thats how the game is played.

Whats more of an epidemic than obesity is fad diets. And every single one of them has had a reasonable-sounding explanation for why it should work, and most of them do help you lose weight for the first month or two (often for psychological reasons).
 
If you want to be more than another fad dieter, Aaron, you need to not only take rigorously regular measurements of your weight, you need to stick to it for a year or two at least, and commit to reporting back to us in this same space whether it works  or not.

Dont get me wrong, Im not saying that all people with weight problems are lazy and should therefor work harder. All I tried to say was that if you are going to lose weight by going on a path of least resistance type of diet you are going at it the wrong way. Because the path of least resistance is probably what got you there in the first place.
 
The eat well advice is, as far as I believe, still the best way to lose weight. The point is, we as a society have forgotten what eating well means. In a world as today it is easy to go for the wrong type of foods instead of the stuff that is actually healthy. Lots of good foods are being replaced by digestable stuff (Im not calling it food) wrapped in marketing. Eating well is not something they want you to do. They as in the fast-food/sugar factories of this world. Because they cant make money of people preparing their own food instead of buying their pre-made crap. (Thats what I am being hostile towards, not the diet itself)
 
They will spend milions on marketing campaigns getting you into their restaurants (if you can call them that). Which in turn makes our children (and the society as a whole) believe that eating fast-food, drinking sugarry water and doing as little as posible is what we do. I think that losing weight is something that should be fought with education instead of hip diets.
 
Then again, if the shangri-la diet helps you lose weight, go for it.. But you should also realise that its only part of the solution. Not a cure-all. Because if you want a diet to work, it should be something life-changing and most diets do not work the rest of your life. You should also change what you eat instead of only changing how you eat.

While I agree with the backlash (a notoriously loaded term, BTW), I take issue with tuomovs no pain, no loss motto. It seems long-term success often involves learning to derive great satisfaction from what at first glance involves sacrifice. If youve been eating moderately and exercising routinely for a while now and still regard it negatively as starvation and strenuous exercise, youre not getting it, and need a major reorientation.

The only way to lose weight is to use up more energy than you eat. That means eating less than your body expects. That means feeling hunger as your body is not getting what its wants. The pain will be worse until your body starts burning the fat for energy, but the hunger will be there even after that. Maybe eating tasteless calories will help there, but I doubt it is any more efficient than simply drinking water to give the stomach something to do. Now, maintaining the lost weight is a different matter. There I agree that simply no pain, no loss isnt a sufficient tactic, but no magic diet is.

What I want to know is: What do you folks lose by trying it, instead of foaming at the mouth about how it doesnt work?
 
Theres enough information freely available online, you dont need to buy any book. All you need is sugar and water or a  bit of oil. Heck, the author made his original 60-some-odd page research paper available for free: http://www.freakonomics.com/pdf/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf

I just downloaded the paper off the Internet, but I cant seem to find it associated with any peer-reviewed scientific journal.  Can you provide a link?  Maybe theres also a double-blind study out there involving human beings, perhaps even human beings other than those administering the study?  That would be the minimum scientific research any responsible party would need to have in hand before flashing the phrase Eat Anything to a bunch of impressionable yo-yos.

I dont think people are angry that there is a miracle cureI just think they dont believe it, are annoyed with the continued search for the magic pills (when a reasonable solution is right there and people just refuse it b/c its hard), and dont buy that eating well and exercising dont work (all these stats about people dieting/working out and not losing)they do work, if you actually do them.  The fact that most people cant maintain healthy behavior doesnt mean that healthy behavior isnt the answer, it isand the fact that people cant work hard and prefer stomach staples and bypassing the large intestine surgeries, speed pills and sugar water tonics, etc. should just make us sad(weve gotten really spoiled)but shouldnt give credence to these methods - gastric bypass kills 1/1000 on the operating table and more later from down the road complications (as one example).
 
Knowing how intelligent you are I am just amazed that you are drawn in by set points and sugar watersugar water for chrissakethis is a coke w/o carbonation and food coloring.  You think coke is the answer?  Maybe if you drank enough cokes so you werent hungry at all you might lose weight too, and health.
 
Olive oil has medicinal properties, and I could see it providing some weight loss aid as wellif maybe you are nutritionally imbalanced in some way, which I would assume most of us are (there was that whole Lorenzos Oil thing too after all).  You might also try flax seed oil, shark oil, and a few others the nice folks at your local health food store can point you at.
 
As a matter of fact, as the logical thinker you are why not try a reasonable portions all healthy food diet vs. sugar water and olive oil set point diet test.  I bet the health food and exercise leaves you with more energy, lean muscle, and general happiness with body makeup than cokes and olive oil ever will.

Im lucky enough not to really have a genetic predisposition to carry lots of weight.
 
But I did manage to put on about 10 pounds in one year, and these days Im eating well and riding 80-120 miles per week on my bicycle.
 
There are lots of fad diets out there. Atkins is particularly bad - take a look at the two case histories here (http://www.diseaseproof.com/archives/diet-myths-434-case-histories-the-atkins-diet.html).
 
My goal is not to keep my weight in a certain range. My goal is to be healthy, and to do that, I think you have to understand how food affects you, eat well (ie lots of fresh food, whole grains, limited processed food), and get some exercise. In other words, something that you can keep up for decades.
 
Of all the stuff Ive looked at, I think that South beach is the most rational approach, as it is something you can follow for a lifetime. It is not geared towards athletes, but it can be modified.
 
I wont claim that I understand what people who have lots of extra weight go through, since Ive never been there. But I have read an article by a women who had tried diets for years, gone to weight watchers, and then one day thought, If I want to lose weight, why am I hanging around with people who arent successful at being thin? She starting looking at what the thin people did, did that, and didnt have any problem doing that.
 
As for this approach, lets see some real studies that look both at weight loss and overall health of this approach compared with other approaches.

Whats more of an epidemic than obesity is fad diets. And every single one of them has had a reasonable-sounding explanation for why it should work, and most of them do help you lose weight for the first month or two (often for psychological reasons).
 
Completely wrong.
 
There is good, clear research that shows that changing what you eat will produce weight loss for the first 2-3 weeks.  any diet will work for about a month, which, with a little publicity, is how the fraudulent diet industry works.
 
For people who are overweight, most of them are like alcoholics, except with food rather than alcohol, and there is no way to become abstinent (e.g. alcoholics join AA and then quit drinking.  You can join OA, but unless you starve to death, you will have to eat again).
 
The hostility comes almost completely from one group of posters:  those neo-calvinists who see weight loss as the mandate of heaven  a reward for superior virtue.  If you just eat right and exercise you will lose weight and keep it off.  Those who do not lose weight must not be virtuous because that simple forumla doesnt work for them.
 
The sub-set of people (such as at Alas, A Blog) who hate all diets and diet books as a fraudulent industry that thrives on abuse and deceit, I dont see them posting here.
 
But what the diet does (and it got its name from a vote by people who were using it, it got its book cover from the publicist, along with the sound bite descriptions) is it threatens the perceived mandate of heaven, the moral superiority and inherent virtue of the thin.
 
The real potential for societal issues from the diet, is that people who have stabilized on it seem to eat about half of what they did before.
 
Will we end up a nation of scrawny frenchmen (big surprises about going to Paris included the fact that the French seem to have quit smoking, they now curb their dogs, the place was wonderful with polite people, and they were all very thin, scrawny even)?  Who knows.  But if the diet spreads and works like it is appearing to work, we will end up a nation that uses about half the food that we did.
 
I guess that leaves more crop-land for alcohol production to fuel cars 
 
Anyway, I ate right and exercised for a long time without losing weight, though I got to where I was moving 30 pounds over the maximum on a number of the machines (Id just toss 15 lb barbells on the weight stack). I was still 240.
 
This morning I was in the 180s (though Ive gone myo on my workout  Ive also added Judo).

Well, I have to say that Im now in the 170s.
 
The system works.  The best thing about the Shangri-la diet is that you can try it without buying the book.
 
A friend called it the try it first for free diet, and then noted if it works, you can just keep doing it for free.  Not like you have to buy anything special, any light, flavor free oil or sugar will do, you can find all the instructions on-line.
 
It is fun to watch the diet ripple out among friends and family and hear them talk about how it changes how they feel about food.
 
Just an update.

====================================================
Date: April 28, 2006
 
Title: A Future Without Fat
 
Ive been on the Shangri-La diet long enough to convince myself that theres definitely something to it. Yesterday, for example, I spent all morning moving furniture (were moving to a new apartment) and around lunch time I got invited to lunch at a favorite pizza place with a friend and I jogged all the way there. Normally, at this point, Id be famished and devour half a pizza. This time, I wasnt hungry at all (but I had a slice out of politeness).
 
Of course, theres no reason my particular anecdotes should be more convincing than any others, but they are convincing to me, so Id like to move from discussing the diet to discussing its implications. Weight and trying to lose it is a huge part of American culture and a system that makes doing it trivially easy will have far-reaching effects.
 
The most basic, it would seem, is more thin people. Theres clearly an enormous number of people who want to lose weight. A lot are so desperate that they will try any number of painful and crazy tactics, from Slim-Fast shakes to Atkins meals, that are touted as helping. Obviously these people will try the diet.
 
But also a large number of people (like myself) who see themselves as too skeptical to fall for a fad diet or too lazy to jump through its hoops will try this diet, since its both scientifically proven (or will be, after further clinical trials) and super-easy. And unlike Atkins, there are few concerns about nutritional dangers  the diet doesnt require you to change the balance of foods you eat, just the quantitity  so a bunch more reasons not to do it disappear.
 
As it takes off, commercial products will soon follow  branded pocket-sized flasks of ELOO, for example. The media will do stories on this latest craze and the ideas behind it. Clinical trials will demonstrate its effectiveness and suggest areas for further research, which will lead to it being refined. And popular culture will likely try to deal with the results.
 
Among those results: lots of people you know getting thin. Its difficult to imagine what this is going to be like. The fat guy at the office wont be fat anymore. That cute-but-slightly-overweight girl youve had your eye on wont be slightly overweight anymore. Social dynamics will be seriously disrupted in a way that, to my knowledge, has no analog. People have gotten taller, and thinner, and prettier over time, to be sure, but never quite this fast.
 
The flip side of the drive to be thinner is the discrimination against those who are fat. American culture is simply vicious towards the less fortunate. Youre poor because youre lazy, it says, and youre fat for the same reason. If only you got some exercise or ate better, youd look fine. Its your own damn fault and theres nothing wrong with me looking down on you for it.
 
If the theory behind the diet is correct, however, this just isnt so. Fat people are that way simply because their bodys set point is too high. Thats not really anything you can blame them for and its also something that, before the diet, was really hard to fix. They live with a burden of wanting to eat that thin people, with their lower set point, never have to deal with. And the entire time theyve been struggling, theyve been told its simply their own damn fault. (As I noted, their situation mirrors that of the poor.)
 
Of course, its unlikely our culture will ever notice the horrors its committed against fat people. Instead, the diet is likely to make it even more vicious. Now that theres a simple easy way to get thin, anyone who refuses to use it will be turned against with serious scorn. Being fat may become as much of a social rudity as being a smoker, with strangers feeling that they can lecture you about your unhealthy lifestyle in public. Itll be pure torture.
 
But, I have no doubt, itll work. Sipping ELOO is much easier than quitting smoking and tons of people are doing the latter. And so the last few overweight people will be pushed to join the pack. While its unlikely that obesity will be entirely eradicated, its hard to imagine the last few hangers-on (perhaps those for whom the diet doesnt work or who cant do it for some reason) making up a significant sect of the population.
 
The diet book itself saves most of its vision for future generations who, it suggests, will never have to think about obesity at all because the new science behind the diet will allow us to build it right into our foods, so that we will simply never get fat in the first place. Certainly, at a minimum, childrens set points will be regulated from a very early age (what parent wouldnt want to spare their child from fat-kid teasing?) and theyll likely never even consider another possibility.
 
To our children, obesity will probably seem like just another relatively-rare disease, like a learning disability or a speech impediment. Theyll look back at movies from our time and think well, actually, they wont notice anything because weve already removed the fat people from them.

You assume that everyone who is fat is just waiting patiently for the solution to their weight problem.  There are a lot of fat people who either dont care that they are fat, or dont consider themselves fat.  In fact, there are even fat people who are proud to be fat, and who have formed fat-awareness organizations dedicated to fighting the evil medical institution that is telling them to lose weight.

In case it wasnt clear, Im a supporter of fat acceptance.
 
I say obesity will be unknown to our children because a) changes in the way food is made will make it harder to become fat and b) social pressure will force parents to force their kids to lower their set point. I dont see what either of these has to do with people wanting to lose weight or not.

I believe fat has qualities that create the feeling of satiety. A good book you should check out is Nutrition and Physical Degeneration by Weston Price. http://www.westonaprice.org/index.html. Youll need to mentally filter out some unsubstantiated claims, but whats underlying will probably explain whats going on with the Shangri-La Diet.

Aaron, how long have you been on the diet? It takes a minimum of about five years to be sure that you dont gain back the weight. I am on moderate form of the Ornish diet. I lost almost 30 pounds over the course of six months and kept it off for two years, but in the past year I have gained back almost 20 pounds. Very discouraging.

I understand the skepticism about Atkins. Granted, Atkins is not an exactly healthy diet. Far from it. But at least to me, personally, it hasnt been painful at all. I decided to try it after having read the whole Wikipedia article about it. I like to do things right so I talked to my doctor first and got an OK from him. It was more of a curiosity thing (hm, could this really work?), Im definitely not acting out of despair here, specially because Ive been only, well, slightly overweight.
 
I actually enjoy eating meat and its always been a part of my normal diet, I just took out the rice, potatoes, bread and other high sources of carbohydrates. And as long as youre having decent meals, keeping yourself hydrated and (this is very important) taking fibers and a couple of fruits a day (as a source of vitamins), its safe and, like I said, not painful at all. Actually this is slowly proving to be the easiest and fastest diet I ever took.
 
Im sure you already did, but I recommend to anyone else reading this to read the Wikipedia article on Atkins. Definitely not a panacea of diets (like this Shangri-la diet seems to be), but worth trying for anyone who has steaks included in their regular diet. Well, Works For Me (TM).
 
I should also note that you dont have to keep the crazy habit of only eating meat/eggs/cheese all the time. You increase carb intake by 5-10g each week by gradully adding your old sources of carbs to your diet again, always being careful to check if youre not gaining any new weight. If you keep up regular exercises (jogging every morning, like you do), you can even have your carbs normally as youll be spending them all during exercise. It makes perfect sense to me.

I still think the Shangri-La diet is just the new hotness in a long line of absurd diets.
 
Id like to add that the whole notion of a diet in the first place is counter productive. Being on a diet automaticly tells you that youre not appreciated or that you dont appriciate yourself enough. Which in turn makes you unhappy and less able to lose weight. So maybe the answer should be; improve your happyness instead of your doing it wrong!

I think part of the fat acceptance movement is just plain good humanism but part of it is also apathy against too great an opponent. Once you start to realize that you just cannot lose weight for good, you begin to accept it, because its better to be happy and fat than unhappy and fat. And its totally understandable, because fighting against the set point really is hard. (If the Shangri-La diet works as advertised, it will, of course, change the whole game.)
 
By the way, Aubrey de Grey thinks that the same sort of apathy is at work with another big health problem: death.
 
See http://www.sens.org/ for more details.
 
(Whether or not we actually can win the War on Death is orthogonal to the apathy, so long as we dont know for sure whether we can cure death.)

As a science-fiction postulate, What if there really were a miracle diet? doesnt strike me as all that great a premise, because the topic can be unpleasant to people who have tried diets and gained back the weight. But maybe its the execution, since Ive read a story or two about What if a quack medicine really worked? (on the other hand, it might not be so entertaining to those suffering from chronic illness and have tried quack medicines).
 
Note that sociologically, its fairly well-established that your parents wealth is a major factor determining your own wealth. This hasnt had much of an effect on the ideology that views it as entirely a matter of individual work.

You sound like those people in the 50s who, after the invention of nuclear power, were talking about nuclear cars in the year 2000.  I, like Loughborough, will lay odds that this diet will turn out to be as problematic as the rest.  Which isnt to say we will never find a magic diet, just that this probably isnt it.  Youre extrapolating far too much from a small data set, always a recipe for error.  Cant you see it staring you in the face in this sentence?  Clinical trials will demonstrate its effectiveness and suggest areas for further research, which will lead to it being refined.[Emphasis added]

Aaron, perhaps you should post your weight and graph it on a daily or weekly basis? In fact, how about an updating mini-banner that bloggers could put in their sidebars? Maybe a picture of you and text along the lines of Obesity cured by the scientific Shangri-La Diet. Aaron Schwartzs weight today is 135 pounds.

Are you serious?  The magic bullet huh?  It was discovered long before this: exercise and responsible eatingany number of other things work, actually pretty well sometimes - starvation (people who say this will make you fat need only think of the nazis acts of atrocity, the ethopian famine, or any number of 80 pound starlets), diet pills (cough, speed), smoking, illness but, i think you get my point, while people are different there is going to always be one thing that works: eating only what you need (differs from person to person, gotta figure it outbut some basics are obvious  like which foods are fat laden, which are nutrient rich and calorie low, which have lots of protein, and that the harder you work the more of all of this you need, the less you work the less you need) and working that food back offyou dont move enough to burn it off it stayspeople need to move a certain amount just to burn healthy food intake and not start gaining weight  your body has a natural tendency to store unused material for later  this helped in a state of nature when people often starved in lean months.  it simply does come down to this.  theres your magic bullet: and if parents want their kids to be thin they wouldnt feed them cokes and candy and would only let them eat appropriate portions  and theyd get them off the couch and outside.  done.

Sounds intriguing enough to be worth a try if I ever feel like dieting. I expect that a handful of nuts would have the same effect as the olive oil, and is in fact what I will personally choose if I ever try this. (Im not a doctor but I am someone living educatedly with an insulin disorder, and have found that nuts and other positive fats, in small doses, really do curb most and sometimes all of my cravings.)
 
I dont really know if the set point thing could actually eradicate what our society terms overweight even if we wanted it to though. For many people, their bodies actual best healthy weight for maintaining optimal functioning is higher than what doctors today will recommend. They might not be as healthy if they lowered their set points to an extent that would result in their looking what we currently consider acceptably thin. Ex: I am chubby, but I routinely have doctors tell me I am 60-80 pounds overweight. If I weighed 40 pounds less, which might be nice someday, Id be the same svelte weight I was the summer I was 17 and worked outside as a camp counselor all day, lifting & swimming & running & teaching dance. I cant imagine it being possible for my body to be healthier than that. But I was curvy even then. Another ex: one of my fat close friends (she actually spent years on the board of NOLOSE, the national organization for lesbians of size), has the best cholesterol and blood pressure levels of anyone I know, eats a very healthy diet, and works out regularly. Etc. Until we as a society can wake up and stop measuring health as weight or actually, visible appearance of slenderness, we wont realize how irrelevant fat can sometimes (certainly not always) be.
 
I certainly believe that there are points where obesity is dangerous, but theres quite a large spectrum of weight thats healthy that Id hate to see us lose. I for one think chubby people are overall cuter, so the world would be a bonier, twiggier, less-sexy place for me.
 
And since I seem to have dissolved into a mini-rant (not aimed at you), one pet peeve - why should it matter if that cute chubby girl youve had your eye on lost weight/was no longer considered fat? If a persons cute, and youve got your eye on them, the fact that other people think theyre overweight is kind of a silly thing to factor in - yet something far too many people do. (I mean the you in that general pronoun sense.)

I should add re the nuts thing, that I get that its about flavor but I also think thats vaguely bs, in my not having read the book way, because from what little Ive seen of people discussing the diet so far, it seems people do register the taste of the sugar and the oil anyway. I think an almond or two would hardly register more than oil or sugar.

Yes Aaron, Ive made sure to take the sugar-water at least one hour away from other food/drink (I dont even drink water in that time period, but mainly because after the sugar-water Im not thirsty). I get really hungry (as usual for me) in the hour after eating, have the sugar-water, which fills me up a bit and reduces my hunger somewhat, and then wait at least another hour before eating again. And still, Im eating just as much as before. Ill keep trying it for maybe another week, but if it doesnt start to have some effect by then I think Ill give up and just keep up with the exercise (just wanted to hurry things along a little by suppressing myrather largeappetite a bit).

Are you serious? The magic bullet huh? It was discovered long before this: exercise and responsible eating. except that just doesnt work.  Unless you call 2% of those who diet taking off five pounds for a year success.
 
This works, and works well.  Ive tried a lot of things, exercised hard (Im moving the maximum weights on the Cybex machines at the gym, sometimes with thirty or more pounds added on top of the stack), and been through it.
 
Ive lost 51 pounds (as of this morning) on this method.
 
Though the mental shifts are the strangest part of it all.
 
People who have not been fat dont get it.
 
Doug you might want to try more sugar.  I had to use a quarter cup of sugar or two tablespoons of oil to get an effect, some people use twice that (they take in the equivilent of four tablespoons of oil a day in calories, split between morning and evening, often some in sugar and some in oil).
 
It depends on just how much weight you need to lose, among other things.

not sure a 2% of those dieting only taking off five pounds a year statistic is even somewhat meaningfulas many people misreport, most people are on all different sorts of diets, people have different starting points  maybe all some needed to lose was 5 pounds, dieting is only one component (exercise is the other)  and i didnt say dieting, i said responsible eating  dieting is watching calories, reading labels, weighing thingsi dont think any of that is really necessary
 
in any CONTROLLED environment of adults healthy enough to exercise who had an enforced eating and workout regimen you would see resultsover time all members would come down to fighting weight  this controlled environment of limited food and required exercise?  its call a state of nature, where the overweight simply dont exist.

Until age 23, I was six foot one, 165 pounds.
 
I got into a weight training program and put on about 10 lbs of muscle over a year. So until age 25, I was a somewhat muscular 175.
 
I worked at a startup for a couple years, where we had free food. The stress of the startup led to a lot of beer drinking and pizza eating after midnight. When I was 27 I had ballooned up to 215.
 
I was pretty disgusted with myself, so I decided to get back to my high school weight. I dropped 20 pounds over a year simply by walking to work and not drinking beer or eating pizza. Thus by age 28 I was down to 195, and by age 29 I was down to 180.
 
Now Im 31 and back to about 178 lbs. I plan on losing 18 more pounds by exercising more.
 
Im not sure I buy the flavorless calories and set point aspects.  I think whats really going on is you just want something to make you not hungry.
 
Im pretty sure you could cut out junk food and eat almonds or slim fast shakes instead of pizza and beer and soda, and youd see the same results. However I guess Ill try out this shangri la thing for a few months to see how it goes.

My husbands sister was an alcoholic.  He decided he had enough to deal with without that problem, and so decided to never even take a drink and hes never looked back.
 
People who do drink generally have two reactions to this.  Some of them say, thats cool, and go on with their lives.  The others, especially if theyre drinking at the time, go out of their way to try and talk him into drinking.  Those in the latter catagory are quick to proclaim how comfortable they are with their alcohol use and how theres absolutly nothing wrong with what they are doing, while the former group might say that if you asked them about it, but dont feel obliged to offer up the opinion unsolicited.
 
If youre considered to be overweight by your doctor, but feel comfortable in your body and have good health and dont want to lose weight, thats cool with me.
 
But when you start going around telling everyone who says theyre on a diet how they just need to accept themselves and really it isnt unhealthy to be fat etc. etc., you start to sound like maybe you arent quite as comfortable with yourself as you purport to be.
 
And this is coming from someone who is well into the obese catagory.
 
Oh, and the whole you dont have a problem with your weight, you have a problem with your self-esteem canard is completely ridiculous.  If someone is working at mcDonalds and decides to get their GED, do you tell them, you dont have a problem with your education, you have a problem with your self-esteem?  Nobodys perfect, and trying to improve yourself doesnt mean you hate yourself.

Aaron, I havent read the book but I wonder if the taselessness of the olive oil might be inconsequential and the reduced appetite might be  caused by you spreading your calorie-intake more evenly over the day.
 
There seems to be a theory that says that if we allow the body to feel hunger between meals, it goes into famine-mode - lowering its default calorie burn-rate while prompting us to gobble up more (quick! quick! while theres chance!) and stashes the extra calories away for later use.
 
The theory says that if you eat more frequently but less at a time, our body goes into more of a laisser-faire lets-burn-it-all-away mode.
 
A friend of mine tried a variant of this eat all the time method, and said he noticed a big change in his usual appetite.
 
P.S. Im pretty much ideal weight myself, so I havent tried any of this. However, I find the whole subject quite interesting.

Mar, the tastelessness of the oil is a key component, not an inconsequential one.
 
Roberts is pretty straight-forward (i.e., he doesnt bury an explanation in the appendix) that he doesnt quite get why the sugar works, given it has a distinct flavor. He has a few theories, however.

Jonas,
 
I know people who did Atkins and for most of them it didnt work.
 
I did the South Beach diet because its less extreme & because it was designed by a cardiologist. You do avoid carbs for the first two weeks, during which time your metabolism changes. After that, you gradually start adding healthy carbs. Unlike Atkins, you also avoid bad fats (saturated & trans-fats) and only eat healthy fats. After the first few weeks, youre encouraged to eat healthy carbs like vegetables.
 
That was two years ago & I lost 50 pounds and kept it off. My cholesterol was always extremely high, but I never wanted to take medication for it because I was afraid of the side effects. As of earlier this year, my cholesterol is now near normal without medication. At this point I only avoid sugar & fatty foods and eat more whole grains.
 
The reason obesity is so widespread is because our diet is full of empty calories that lead to overeating. Sugar is especially bad, since it immediately raises your blood sugar, causing your body to react by producing insulin, which then lowers your blood sugar, which makes you feel hungry. Complex carbs like whole grains dont do that & keep you feeling satisfied longer so you eat less.

Thought I would add that the diet is still working for me.  Now that Im in size 34 pants, size 32 belts, it is probably time to taper it off a bit, but Ive lost 65 pounds so far.  It has worked solidly for me since November 13, 2005.

I just started SLD and I think its working!  I have been thinking about Seths theory and have starting to wonder if the inverse would also be true.  If consuming Flavor-Less calories lowers your appetite setpoint then wouldnt it go to reason that consuming strong flavors with out calories would increase your appetite setpoint?  What if every time I drink a diet Pepsi or chew a stick of sugar free gum Im signaling my body to raise its appetite setpoint?
 
For the last several years I have struggled with my weight.  For that reason I eat/drink for more diet foods than I ever did in the past i.e. sugarless gum, diet soda and reduced calorie cookies, dressings etc.    These diet foods could be sabotaging me efforts.  What do you think???

I dont think its gonna change the way they make our food.
The bad guys (government/FDA/drug manufacturers and diet co.)
want americans to be fat. If or when this diet gets more momentum
The bad guys will be scrambling to debunk it.  They will continue to find more sneaky ways to make us fat because they profit from unhealthy and fat americans.
I just started the diet myself. After reading the book it makes alot of sense. It cant hurt to add ELOO to my diet. I think the worse thing that can happen is I just might get down to my dream weight.
 
On a side note though, I noticed a funny thing on amazon.com
in the customers also bought section they had speedo nose plugs.  I laughed and thought about it.  We plug our noses when we dont wanna taste something nasty that we have to take.
Its scientifically proven that our taste is linked to our sense of smell.
If it is gonna change anything in our culture, we may see alot of people wearing nose plugs to dinner.  Perhaps maybe a shrangri la brand nose plug lol.

====================================================

Title: The Miracle Diet
 

 
You eat food that has calories. And you do things that burn calories. The calories left over get stored as fat. And thus, the typical advice for losing weight: eat less, exercise more. Fewer calories are eaten and more are burned and so the result is less fat. Theres just one problem: thats really hard. To burn enough calories to lose a lot of weight, you really have to put an awful lot of time into it. And if you try to eat less, your body just feels hungry all the time, because it wants more.
 
So what if instead of forcing your body to eat less, you teach your body to want less. After all, its clear that its obesity, not lack of fat, thats the health problem. So getting your body to want less food would be a good thing. And it would make dieting incredibly easy too  instead of fighting to count calories or avoid eating certain foods, you do nothing at all; youre just not interested in eating.
 
It sounds like a pipe dream, but Seth Roberts argues that its possible. Drawing on the results of a number of studies with rats, his own experiments on himself, and the best research on nutrition and weight loss, hes developed a theory of how the body decides what it feels like eating.
 
Our bodys weight, he says, is regulated by a set point, like the setting on a thermostat. If our weight is lower than our internal set point, we feel hungry; higher, we feel full. So if you want to weigh less, all you need to do is lower your bodys set point. Your body will stop being hungry, youll burn the fat you already have, and your weight will go down.
 
But how would you do that? Roberts argues that a persons set point isnt fixed, instead it goes up and down based on what they eat. After all, the whole reason the body stores up  calories when food is abundant is so it can use them in lean years, when food is scarce. So it would make sense for a persons set point to go up when food is abundant (allowing them to build up fat) and down when its scarce (so they dont feel hungry all the time).
 
The problem, of course, is that food is never scarce anymore. You can always just go to McDonalds. The body is storing up for an eventuality that will never come. So how do you get it to stop? Maybe you could trick it into thinking food was scarce.
 
This is where Robertss big insight comes  he argues that we use a Pavlovian sort of flavor-conditioning system to see whether food is scarce. If we eat foods frequently, we grow to like their taste, and thus our brain realizes were eating them out of choice and raises the set point. On the other hand, if we eat new foods or foods with little taste, our brain assumes were eating them because theres nothing else around and the set point is lowered.
 
And thus, the way to lower your set point: eat foods with no taste. Of course, they have to have calories as well, so Robertss preferred suggestion is extra-light olive oil (ELOO), which is basically just oil with absolutely no taste. Your body gets the calories but it doesnt get the taste, so the set point goes lower every time you eat it.
 
It all seems crazy, but Roberts is sort of a crazy guy, so he decided to test it. He started taking a couple hundred tasteless calories every day. Almost immediately, he begun feeling less hungry. He started eating one meal every other day, even while still exercising, and felt great. He lost a pound of weight a week with no effort. He lost so much weight that his friends started telling him that he looked too thin, so he started taking less tasteless calories and put some weight back on. It was amazing; a diet plan unlike any other.
 
He told friends about it and it worked for them too. It was written up in The New York Times and readers wrote in with letters saying it was working for them. Blogs started to keep track of peoples stories  almost all successful. And now he has a new book yesterday, The Shangri-La Diet, which explains how you can do it to.
 
The book is odd, in that it looks pretty much like any other silly diet book, but the contents are rather different. Although clearly rushed, the book has an appendix of scientific studies using rats to back up its arguments about theory and happily features the stories of people who tried the diet and found it didnt work along with those who tried the diet and found it did.
 
Obviously, such anecdotal evidence isnt enough to prove the system works, but it does make it intriguing enough to try. Ive started taking a couple tablespoons of extra light olive oil and already I found myself skipping a meal, something Ive never been able to do before. Well see how it goes.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

You know - extra virgin olive oil is NOT the same as extra-light olive oil.
 
The former is prized for being full of flavor, so if thats what youre eating, then whatever changes youre seeing are probably due to the placebo effect, or something entirely different.
 
On the other hand, it could just be a typo.

Hrm.  Id rather fast every other week or once a month, eat healthy and exercise regularly.  Steady improvement, incremental gains maintained consistently over time lead to large returns within several months.  A book Id recommend for this is Body for Life by Bill Phillips.
 
Eating tasteless food makes it seem like eating is work instead of an opportunity to relax, enjoy the company of good friends or a good book and take a break from the daily grind.
 
Also, a question: how is he getting nutrition if hes just eating olive oil?  Does he add in vitamins and minerals via supplements?

Fasting for how long? When I fast it sort of kills productivity.
 
Im not sure how eating tasteless food makes it seem like eating is work. The book talks about how eating is much more an opportunity to enjoy yourself because you can choose where and how you do it.
 
Also, a question: how is he getting nutrition if hes just eating olive oil?  Does he add in vitamins and minerals via supplements?
 
Yes, he takes supplements and still eats one meal a day.

Given Aarons description, I dont think the book disagrees with that. We can all agree that its an input  process  output issue right? If you process less than you input you store the output.
 
The question this guy tries to solve is, how do I lower input? Your proposed solution is eating healthy and fasting, but thats the same as saying satiating hunger with stuff thats not necessarily what you want to eat, and dieting.
 
Ignoring the how do I eat healthy when I want to eat junk question, the next step is, how do I get the resolve to diet if Im hungry?
 
Solving the I dont need to eat but Im hungry problem in a relatively universal and testable way would be pretty cool. I bet there are people doing actual science (robust experiments) about that issue.

If eating tasteless foods sends a signal to your body that food is scarce and its time to burn off fat, then wouldnt it be better to eat food that tastes positively awful? Maybe you should be downing cod liver oil rather than olive oil. Seriously, try it; it worked for me.  ;-)

No pain, no loss.
 
Forget all these bullshit weight-loss manuals. Those four words above summarise all that you need to know. The rest is just pain management and scheduling. If you dont feel hungry occasionally, youre not losing weight. The trick is then to schedule the hunger to times where you can best tolerate it (and have the smallest chance of picking up a snack), and try to minimise the duration of pain by giving the stomach something to do. That can be done by drinking water and other low-energy drinks (green and herbal teas without too much sugar, etc.). Excercise also helps by masking the pain with endorphins.
Exercise itself, however, does not use up much energy, although it can increase your metabolism. Infact, excercise should be used to replace the lost fat in muscles with new muscle tissue.

I lost 50 pounds on the South Beach diet almost 2 years ago and Ive kept it off.
 
What I learned is refined carbs like white flour & sugar spike your blood sugar levels, then a rush of insulin brings it down & the resulting low blood sugar makes you hungry again. If you eat complex carbs like whole grains, brown rice, etc. your blood sugar level stays relatively stable and you dont get hungry.
 
At this point Im maintaining my weight by simply avoiding sugar & bad fats and eating more whole grains (plus going to the gym). As a bonus, my cholesterol, which used to be dangerously high, is now close to normal without taking any medication for it.

Cod liver oil might work for a little while, but eventually if it had enough calories youd grow to like the taste (according to the theory).
 
If you dont feel hungry occasionally, youre not losing weight.
 
Did you even bother to read the blog post? (Obviously youll still feel hungry occasionally, like when you need to eat a normal meal, but I assume you meant feeling more hungry than before losing weight.)

You can grow to kind of like the feeling of hunger. It tells you that something good is happening, and so you feel great, if the feeling doesnt become too grave. Infact, eating too much can make you feel bad (not pain, just bad) after youre used to a bit of hunger.
 
Anyway, Im just saying that you should eat almost what you want. Youre losing weight if you feel hungry. If you dont feel hungry, you probably arent losing weight, at least not significantly, and you need to change what you are eating or cut down on it. No need for magical diets, your body can tell you, if youre losing weight.

Ive been hearing about Seths stuff for a while via Andrew Gelman at Columbia. Im skeptical that your body actually knows its weight. Your body generally deals in chemical and thermal signals, not abstract concepts like weight. You have some volume sensors in your stomach, but again, not weight. Its entirely possible that it works for some other reason, so it doesnt really matter, but Id really like to see whats going on in terms of insulin levels and so on. He could actually be just smoothing his calorie dose schedule.
 
Exercise itself, however, does not use up much energy, although it can increase your metabolism.
 
That very much depends on what youre doing. Endurance events are a lot about trying to figure out how to get enough calories to avoid bonking.

Seth replies:
 
It uses the concentration of leptin in the blood. Fat cells produce leptinthe more fat, the more leptin. The blood gathers the leptin from all the fat cells and carries it to the brain. The brain detects the concentration of leptin in the blood and uses it to judge how much fat is on the body. What is really regulated is not body fat but leptin concentration. Which is very closely correlated with body fat.

Ehm.. so you go from perhaps a bit fat, to lets not eat. Sure you loose weight.. not eating has that effect on people.
 
But how is this healthy? This diet sounds like a trick to fool your body. Not healthy way to loose weight. First of all, where do you get the fibers and nutriens? What.. supplements? Yeah.. sure.. our body has been made to aquire its juice by taking pills.. Please, use some common sence.
 
Why not just eat well? As in.. take stuff you can easaly digest, lots of fibers, greens and correct fatty acids. That way .. you can eat stuff which taste good, are good for the system and all without supplements and feeling hungry all the time. (The You-Are-What-You-Eat-Dr-Gillian way)
 
Somehow people want to lose weight the easy way, pff.. just prooves how lazy this McDonalds generation has become.
 
The excersize part is something I do agree with, because all us nerds sit on our collective asses way to much. No wonder we, as a society, grow fat.

Jonas:
 
Youve lost about 2kg of water, congratulations.   Glycogen stored in the liver binds a lot of water; the dramatic initial weight loss in low-carbohydrate diets is almost entirely due to that water loss as glycogen gets depleted.   Its a nice psychological boost but meaningless.  Wait a week and youll see a much lower (but real) rate of weight loss kick in.
 
Simple logic confirms this - 2kg of pure fat contains about 18,000 kCal of energy.  Body fat is less energy dense than this, but its a decent first approximation.   Hard to metabolize in two days short of catching on fire.

I learned about the diet before the book came out, and lost 20 pounds without even trying.  Dr. Roberts isnt suggestiing you live on oil or sugar water, just that you consume some of those tasteless calories between your normal meals, which by all means should be as nutritious and healthy as possible.  As a result you eat less.  My experience, as well as that of many other people who have tried the diet, contradicts the idea that you have to feel hungry if youre losing weight.  If youre sure the diet doesnt work without trying it, or even reading the book, then on what are you basing your opinion except your own ignorance?  Not to put too fine a point on it.

Indeed, Maciej, youre right. It seems (from my carefully maintained records) Im now losing only 200g a day, and I guess that might be only because I keep an intense exercise schedule (jogging) and started lifting weights. So, well, not all that wonderful after all. Im starting to wonder if my weight loss is coming mainly from exercise instead of meat-eating. I might reconsider if Im gonna stick with this diet for much longer now Thanks for the enlightenment (note to self: you havent read Wikipedia enough).

The number Ive read is about 7700 kCal per kg (3500 per pound). So yeah, you cant burn that in two days unless youve been cross-country skiing 24/7.

Roberts actually mentions low-glycemic diets like South Beach and Zone. Besides being a good idea in general (reducing empty calories and lowering insulin), they reduce the flavor-calorie association strength (which is the secret sauce that allegedly makes this diet work).
 
No pain, no loss. Forget all these bullshit weight-loss

If someone tells me heres a safe and painless way to feel less hungry while losing weight Im going to try it. Enduring unavoidable pain is noble; enduring needless pain is just stupid.

Andrew W.K. was on Conan about two years ago, and mentioned that he was trying to gain as much weight as possible.  His strategy was to eat as many salty snacks as he could possibly hold, then switch to sweet snacks until he couldnt eat any more, then back to salty, then to sweet, etc.
 
Ive confirmed that this sort of consumption is possibleits amazing how the fullness feeling disappears upon switching from sweet to salty or vice versa.  being able to do this also makes sense when one takes into account the Pavlovian flavor conditioning.

Long ago I was the epitomy of a health and exercise nut, before it was ever popular.  Im not certain what happened, but I stoppedand started adding on the fat.  More recently, I just get tired of hearing about weight loss and healthiness.  Seriously, how many more years does one add to their life by nutritional eating and exercise?  Maybe working in the funeral industry has warped my ideas of life and living, for I have seen some very thin, healthy people diebefore their time.

The first 2 days I drank the extra light tasting oil at night before bed (several hours after dinner), and drank sugar water between meals. I was still very hungry, and ate a HUGE dinner both nights.
 
I did sugar water last night before bed, and did the oil this morning. I ate a bagel this morning, and I am so full I feel like I might vomit. Normally I eat 2 and am still hungry afterwards. I went to lunch and had a single taco. Normally I might eat 2 or even 3. I feel like I ate a thanksgiving dinner for breakfast this morning.
 
I read the book cover to cover 3 days ago, so this is what I am thinking. Either the effect from the oil was wearing off while I slept, or it took my body a couple days to develop the enzymes to process it properly. Either way, Im going to keep doing the oil in the morning.
 
On a side note, the sugar water doesnt seem to do much for me.
 
Finally, I am an emotional eater. I eat my feelings so we shall see if this diet works for someone who eats out of emotional upset.

Youre a super-taster, right? (I think I might be, although I havent gotten the food coloring out yet to test).
 
What brand of ELOO are you using?
 
I just picked up a bottle from my local supermarket to give this a try, but the taste is pretty awful.

Yep, I eat to eat.  I am definitely an emotional eater.  To my advantage, I quit smoking and quit drinking alcohol 3 years ago.  To my disadvantage, I eat in place of both.  I have put on no less than 80 pounds! I am 58 and currently weigh around 230 lbs!!!  I purchased Bertolli Extra Light and have yet to taste it.  Im still waiting to learn details of this weight loss technique.  I am wondering, too, how does it affect your stool?  Odd question, I know, but is this how we lose weightby flushing out our system?  For sure, this olive oil should loosen things up and out!?  I gotta get this book!!!  Interested to hear more encouragement.

This just confirms what I learned in my high school PE class: fat makes you full. If you eat low-fat or fat-free foods, you wont feel full. By having pure fat between meals, youre helping make yourself feel fuller. Makes perfect sense!

 how does it affect your stool? 
 
No change I noticed.  Two tablespoons may seem like a lot, but measure out the fat in a chicken ceaser salad, for example, or a double quarterpounder with cheese and mayo.
 
On an empty stomach, which is pretty much how I end up eating it, it gets digested completely.

Hi Olga,
You should stop what youre doing. You cant have any taste associated with what you injest. You cannot use EVOO because it has a very strong and distinct flavor, therefore it will NOT work.
 
Same goes with the sugar water. You cant drink it with anything that will give it flavor. Once your boady gets accustomed to the flavor of green tea, it will trigger a high set response for your body.
 
You really need to read the book. Do what I did. The book is really small and the meat and potatos of the diet are about 3 chapters totaling about 100 pages (if that!).
 
Just go to your local Barnes and Noble on a nice quiet evening that you can dedicate 2~3 hours and just read it there. It took me 3 hours to read the whole thing which is about 180 pages (small pages as well).
 
Please do not judge me, I have made a solemn oath to buy the book if the diet works (today is my first day) and it doesnt turn out to be a sham.
 
Im 57 and 165 pounds. Ideally I need to be around 145 so I am hoping to lose 20 pounds. TRoday is my first day and it has been pretty good so far.
 
Ive started out with the sugar water this morning without any breakfast. I drank about 2 tablespoons worth of it in 1 cup (pretty sweet, definately not for the non-sweet-toothian among us) in hot water to make myself sip it over a longer time. This is a recommendation from Dr. Seth in his book.
 
I got a small bottle of ELOO (Bertolli for the afternoons when Im at home so I will try it this evening. Dont know what it tastes like yet.
 
So far today I have had a Chiptole burrito in a bowl (rice, steak, black beans, 2 scoops of corn salsa, 2 scoops of mild salsa, my usual every workday) and I left about a third of it.
 
Its very weird. I was very hungry when I left work to pick up lunch, but by the time I came back and sat down to eat it I was still hungry but not too much and half way thru it I felt pretty full.
 
I couldnt finish the remaining third of it. This is a first. Im not sure if this is due to the sugar water or psychological conditioning (I really want this diet to work so bad that Im lieing to myself about it, because I want to belive that it works so badly. Who knows, only time will tell).
 
Ive got about 2 hours left before I head home and Im debating whether I should get some more sugar water or wait till I get home and try some fo the ELOO.
 
Ill try and update periodically on how its going so far with me.
 
To the gentlemen who wrote that the sugar water did not work for him, I suggest you try adding more sugar before completely discounting its effects.

How are you getting the oil down?  The only thing that works for me is stirring it up in some water and drinking quickly.  Star Extra Light Olive oil still has taste.  How is the Bertolli?  I only did the 2 T after lunch the last 2 days with no noticeable effects, so tomorrow will try it 2X day

Tip for doing the oil - this works for me really well: take a half-mouthful of water, tilt head back, pour in the tablespoon of oil, and swallow (keeping head tilted back).  If you can keep the oil off the tongue, you wont taste it.  Doing this has made the process much more pleasant for me.
 
Also, be willing to be patient a few days.  It took seven days for the appetite suppressing effect to kick in for me (I imagine my set point was pretty high - Im 510, 225lbs), although I did notice SOME effect after the third day.  This seems to jibe with what Ive read on other forums, also.  Some people notice it working by the second day, others take a week.  Hang in there - its such a cheap experiment! ;-)

That was a nice read. Pretty funny. Thanks for the link.
 
However, it doesnt apply to me because I eat the same thing everyday, barring any work related events where food is brought in by caterers (which is not that often).
 
I have the same thing everyday, bowl (no tortilla) w/ rice, steak, blackbeans, 2 scoops corn salsa, 2 scoops mild salsa.
 
If Im really hungry that day, I will either also grab a bag of corn chips and mild salsa or stop by Wendys and grab a large fries (love fries, prefer McDonlads but too out of the way so I settle for Wendys).
 
And since Im typing, might as well add an update
 
Second day update - 
Yesterday I went back home, was a little hungry so I had a Twix. Hour and a half later I took 2 tablespoons of ELOO. Wasnt what I expected (taste not so good) but it wasnt that big a deal for me.
 
I was kind of hungry at that point. Ofcourse, I was still hungry after taking the ELOO so I decided to go out finish painting my deck to try to get my mind of of eating.
 
About an hour later, went back inside. Very thirsty and still hungry but it wasnt as bad as an hour ago.
 
About an hour later had dinner and hit the sack. All in all, was a pretty smooth day.
 
Today same like yesterday, no breakfast, 2 tablespoons of sugar in 1 cup hot water which I sipped on for about 40 minutes. Hunger has been suppressed fairly well like yesterday.
 
The real test will be this afternoon when I exercise. I exercise every other day, usually about 35~45 minutes on my elliptical trainer.
 
Will have to see how I fair this afternoon and tomorrow morning. Im usually hungrier on the morning after the days I exercise.
 
So far though, this has been pretty doable. I can see myself sticking with this for 2 weeks. This is the time frame that I have alloted to invest in this diet to see if it actually works.
 
Hope all is well with everyone else who is trying it out. I am seeing results but I dont know yet if its power of suggestion or the diet thats actually working its magic. Too early to tell.
 
Cheers all.

For those of you - or for your friends, family, or colleagues - who are having difficulty with the science of the diet as an explanation, I thought the following observation by Chris Tregenza in the comments section of Creating Passionate Users was interesting.  Especially in the context of Seth Roberts background in psychology.  Im not saying this is whats going on.  But its an interesting take on things.
 
http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/05/the_strangest_e.html#comments
 
I suspect the effectiveness of this diet has nothing to do with nutrition and everything to do with psychology.  People with a weight problem generally have a negative emotional relationship with food. Often eating becomes a way of self-expression, possibly the only part of their lives they can control.  This book, by saying eat what you want, gives the dieter the permission to eat normally.   Permission is a very strong psychological factor in conformity experiments (e.g. Millgrams electric shock study). By saying eat what you want the diet is giving the dieter permission to have a normal relationship with food.  The two hours a day abstention period is a device that allows the dieter to practice not eating. Its only two hours and they can eat what they want at the end of it. Most people can manage this and when they achieve it they feel good about sticking to the diet, reinforcing the behaviour of not eating.   During the two hours free of stimulants you are likely to become re-tuned to your bodys signals of hunger and thirst. Promoting a heathly, eat when you are hungry, behaviour pattern.   The sugar / oil requirement is odd. I think it serves two functions.   Firstly its a choice, giving the dieter control over what they consume. There is a lot of research on how choice and control effects stress levels.   Secondly its a ritual. A marker point that reminds the dieter about the diet and what they are hoping to do. It also acts as a badge, or a t-shirt, for the brand. e.g. being the one on the office who makes that strange drink once a day. Behaviour can mark your allegiance to something just as much as a t-shirt or tribal scarring can. Once you belong to a tribe, this reinforces your belief or buy-in to the tribes beliefs. This is beneficial in this case because you will loose weight and be healthier but also because you will promote the book to your friends, the authors and publishers are happy as well.

hey all,
 
Im on my 5th day, and Im still not losing any weight. Interestingly I am eating until I feel so full I am going to pop. Again, I am 64 235, and should be no more than 205, but Im taking 3 tablespoons of ELTOO. Drinking it is terrible (believe it or not it scratches my throat), but I am totally skeeved out by injesting that much sugar. As far as the emotional eating.. it hasnt stopped, but it has curbed. I am going to add a 4th Tablespoon as soon as I get home from work (which is when I do most of my eating). I still have over a week to go, but so far no weight results, but again, instead of eating until satisfied, I now find myself eating until I cant eat anymore and much  less.
 
As far as how do I get the oil down. I put it in a double shot glass (which turns out to be exactally 3 tablespoons) and I down it. Ive gagged a couple times, but havent thrown up, so Ill keep with that method unless I start vomiting.

Had to write to reply to Chris, who had to dissect the success of this weightloss method  in a cute little fat people are sort of way. How condescending.
 
I started this method (its not a diet in any sense of the word) recently.  By the third day, a half a small egg roll and a half cup of veggie curry made me feel so full I felt that I might vomit. As a well-educated, materially successful, bright womanI find this no less WEIRD than Chris does. The difference is, I tried it.  And in trying it, I can physically feel the physical difference when I eat.
 
Being fat really doesnt make us more stupid or more suggestible or or more sensitive to ritual or any of that nonsense.  I wish all the naysayers would just TRY IT for a week.  Then they would know the earth isnt flat anymore. For that matter,  if people would just read the book and try it, the earth would not be FAT anymore, either!

Im intrigued by this Blog - after 15 years in the health & fitness industry I certainly believe the bodys thermostat can be adjusted. 
I personally feel a large part of this adjustment comes down to changing peoples perception of food and the amount and type of food they require. And, although I do believe theres a physiological effect in consuming the oil I see the psychological effects of reading this book (and being told that this method of weight loss will work) as more important.
Dont forget that the mind is the most important component in any attempts at change - whether they be health and fitness related or financially related.
As Im an Exercise & Movement Specialist I have to add that exercise has been shown to lower the bodys internal thermostat and play a crucial role in weight loss.
And, as an interesting side note, in Chinese Medicine the balance between Yin and Yang is always stressed. In regards to nutrition, this often refers to the balance between bitter and sweet. In the West this balance is skewed in favor of sweet foods and drink - a good way to break sugar cravings is to consume something bitter (maybe like the Oil?). 
Worst case, even if this diet doesnt help with your weight loss plans; youre decreasing your risks of coronary heart disease by drinking the Olive Oil every day.
Yours in peak performance

Well, its going on two weeks now with the oil, and my appetite is DEFINATELY less. I havent seen any major shifts in my weight, but with my jeans on and my size 12 hiking shoes I am down to 233.2 from 235. I can never be sure about my weight loss though because I fluctuate up to a full 5 pounds in a day on the same scale. I have come into work at 235, and gone home at 240, only to be 235 the next morning again Not sure what thats all about. Finally the last thing I wanted an answer on if anyone has it. I drink a lot of diet coke, and I am wondering if thats breaking down the oil in my stomach and making it digest faster, which according to the diet will have you gain weight. Im doing an experiment right now where I put a tablespoon of diet coke in with 2 of oil, going to check to see how thin it is by end of day. Peace.

Cix, no basically the deal is to have a 2 hour window that is flavour free that is, when you dont ingest ANTHING that is flavoured, including even brushing your teeth.
In the middle of that window, after your first hour, you take the oil, which should be as flavourless as possible (So not extra virgin).
 
then an hour later you are free to eat normally until your next 2hr window. You can do it a couple of times a day (dont know if some people are doing it more?).

 on July 28, 2006 #
 
I take 4 tablespoons of sugar in 1000 ml of water in the morning an hour after I have brushed my teeth.  I drink the mixture across the span of an hour and then I wait another hour (though I generally drink another 1000 ml or water during that time) before I can eat anything else.
 
I also take 2 tablespoons of extra light olive oil at night an hour or so after the last food that I have eaten and dont brush my teeth until another hour has passed.
 
The effect on me is to nearly totally take my mind of food and snacking.  Also, I cant finish a meal of the portion sizes that I used to eat.  I get a startlingly definitive full feeling after a third to a half of what I normally ate.  If I ignore it, I feel unpleasantly stuffed and generally dont feel like eating for a long while.

Good question.  I reduced my triglycerides with a little fish oil (a capsule of it) every monrning.  My mom tried the same thing (we are related, after all) and her results were much slower and less effective.
 
I only used the sugar water for a month or two, and did not measure them during that time.
 
On the other hand, the sugar water has about the same effect as a candy bar, once a day.  Do you eat that much candy regularly?  If so, and you quit because of the diet, it is a wash.
 
Id try to do at least half of the calories by oil and take fish oil with my vitamins every morning, but the bottom line is that no one knows.
 
On the other hand, having lost seventy pounds + I do expect that my triglycerides wont have gone up.
 
Im amazed to still be losing weight.

Well I just started this diet this morning.  I ate breakfast as normal and about an hour after eating I downed the two tablespoons of ELOO.  This diet will definitely help me lose weight.  If not for the scientific reasons, but because I was so nautious for the next 4 or 5 hours that I couldnt eat lunch.  By the time I felt better it was time for dose #2.  The day is now almost over and all Ive eaten is 2 peices of whole grain toast w/ natural pbutter on itand of course the 4 tbsp. of oil.  Does the sicky feeling going away after awhile???

Well you cant argue with proven effects (people losing weight from using the method) But you can still question its long term impact on the body and overall health and if removing hunger instead of eating right is the best way to go at it?
 
Anyway, just my 5 cents.

I am in decent shape, and I just need to find a way to get rid of this flab of fat on my lower abdomen. I have read elsewhere that abdominal exercises do not burn the fat of of your stomach. I believe this is true, but thae calories you burn would do it, right? Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone had a plan different from mine, which was to eat a very low fat diet. I have no problem with my energy level, so I think i can do this and still be competitive. Anyone have any insight?

So whats the good word everyone?
Im still on this train and Ive lost about 65 pounds in a little over 5 months. For the last month Ive been trying to adjust the oil dosage so that I maintain my weight.
I cant lose anymore or I will look quite disturbing and Im afraid to stop becasue Idont want to gain the weight again.
Im determined to stay like this. I cant afford to gain this back again after all this time.

Look, you can break out your testosterone and argue this all you want boys, but the truth is that it works. I dont know why it works but it does. I did and still do Body for Life. Ive been on Atkins and still do it (the right way because Ive read the books). Ive tried everything there is to stop obsessing with food but nothing sticks. I couldnt go out with friends and enjoy company, Id be thinking of the food the entire time. Ive seen shrinks and done counseling. All for not. Now you cant take my ELVOO away from me! Im a believer. Guess what - I still work out and eat high protein, low carbs. But Im not obsessing anymore. Go take that to your Body for Life board. In my opinion, why not use all the tools available to curb appetite? I think most people wont do this because they cant shift paradigms. I dont care if no one else in the world does it. I found my cure and you can argue it into infinity whilst I lose that extra 20 and keep it off.

The first time I drank the oil, straight off a tablespoon, I thought Id toss it back up.  The second time I stirred it into hot water and swallowed it all quick.  Better, but still a little too much aftertaste (even NO taste can leave an aftertaste!)  Third time was the charm - mix it into 1/4 cup or so of COLD water, stir vigorously with a straw and then slurp it up fast through the straw.  You can avoid most of your tongue and just shoot it down your throat.

Hi there,
 
I picked up the book on a recent visit to Barnes and Noble. I was actually looking for 5 Factor Fitness which has been  receiving a llot of press lately but it was sold out. When I started reading about Shangri-la it immediately spoke to me and I couldnt out it down. I just knew it was true. Im on day 3 and I feel so full all the time its uncomfortable. In other wordsIm exstatic. I do have a question though: I want to lose about 25 pounds. Has anyone like me, at 55 1/2 and 151 pounds lost 20 pounds or more with this or is it mostly for obese people??? Thanks!!!

Hey AC,
I am doing Shangri-La PLUS 5-Factor fitness workouts, and its a fantastic combo. I am getting stronger and more toned than ever (great workout program) and Ive gone from 145# to 133.8 in the past 6 weeks or so.  Have only gotten stronger in the gym, no muscle loss! My goal is 129#, and Im 5-6.

Title: Do Faces Cause Depression?: Self-Experimentation in Science
 
It all started, Seth Roberts says, when he wanted more practice doing experiments. The closest thing at hand was himself. He was trying to treat his acne and, although convinced that the pills were effective and the cream was not, he decided to chart their effectiveness anyway for practice. The results were the exact opposite of what he expected  the cream helped and the pills did not. His acne went away and Roberts went looking for bigger problems to solve.
 
Its obvious that sleep follows some sort of circular rhythm, an inner biological clock that makes us tired at the end of the day and refreshed at the beginning. This is the clock that gets thrown off when we travel and thus causes jet lag, for example. But what if other things mess with the clock than simply when we go to sleep?
 
It wasnt simply academic for Roberts, who frustrated from a serious bout of early awakening, in which hed wake up around 4am feeling tired but unable to get back to sleep for another couple of hours. Roberts searched for a way to cure his problem but none of the standard methods seemed appropriate. So he decided to research the subject.
 
A 1979 study of people in caves suggested that contact with other people affected when we fell asleep and a 1985 survey of daily activities in 12 countries led to another clue: Americans were much more often awake around midnight than people in any other country and the only distinguishing factor seemed to be late-night television. Perhaps, Roberts thought, watching television could influence sleeping rhythm?
 
The most popular late-night television show at the time the study was done was the The Tonight Show, with its person-heavy monologue. So one morning Roberts decided to watch Jay Leno and David Lettermans monologues. It seemed to have no impact; an otherwise normal day. But the next morning he woke up feeling great.
 
It was hard to believe that the television show could be responsible, so Roberts decided to formalize the study. Every hour hed write down three numbers between 0 and 100 to measure how unhappy/happy, irritable/serene, and reluctant/eager he was. And then he tried turning the TV watching on and off again to see if it impacted his mood. It did  he always felt better the next day. So he tried adjusting the show and television set, finding that, despite his love for The Simpsons, life-size human faces at about a meter away for 30 minutes worked best.
 
I have to concede, at this point, that the results sound fairly absurd and unbelievable. But reading Robertss papers on the subject, whats striking is how careful he is about the subject. An actual psychologist, publishing in psychology journals, hes taken into account every objection. The results cannot be, as one would first expect, simply self-induced by his own wishes. For one, Roberts took quantitative notes, so his memory couldnt be playing tricks on him. For another, the size of the difference was too large to be explained through normal explanations. If Roberts could simply will himself into waking up happy, why hadnt he done it before? Nor could such an explanation explain the numberss careful sensitivity to how similar the TV watching was to human face contact, especially since Roberts was originally hoping to be able to watch his favorite shows, not face-heavy ones like Charlie Rose.
 
He also began noticing something he wasnt expecting  his mood wasnt just raised the next morning, it was lowered that night. This graph shows the pattern:
 

 
Mood spikes up from 6am to noon, stays high during the day, and then takes a dive around 6pm. (When not seeing faces, mood stays flat.)
 
And what about all those people who watched TV at night? Roberts found that watching TV after 6pm also reduced mood, with the effect more pronounced the later it was watched.
 
So whats going on? If you look at faces in the morning, you feel worse 12 hours later but better 24 hours later. But the effect is muted if you see faces in the evening. Roberts theorizes that your body is using the faces to set its inner mood clock, which works similarly to its inner tiredness clock. You want to be happy during the day (as opposed to the night), but how do you tell when the day starts? The body assumes that you gab with people when you wake up, so it uses seeing other faces as a way to synchronize the clock. Of course, you want to make sure youve got the timing right on the nighttime side as well, so if you see faces late in the evening it tries to tweak the clock then as well.
 
This is consistent with what we know from other sources about depression. Depression is highly correlated with insomnia as well as social isolation and is often treated by disturbing sleep. The Amish, who eat breakfast communally and go to bed very early, have 1/100th the rate of depression as other Americans. And depression rates increased by 10 times in the 1900s, around the same time radio/TV, electric lighting, and other such things became common.
 
Im hoping to get a chance to test this myself, but it sure appears that one easy way to improve mood is to look at faces in the morning.
 
Of course, even more than mood (which is generally considered difficult to tweak) people want to improve their look. And Roberts has done research on this as well, concluding that the body uses a similar internal system to measure the ideal weight. The result is his Shangri-La Diet which uses similar techniques to trick the bodys internal system to cut down on appetite. His book on the subject, The Shangri-La Diet, comes out this week. Its been hailed as a diet book unlike any other. More on that next time.

Im deeply skeptical. Too many Just-So stories. The Amish, in particular, have a complex alternate social system, so its problematic to attribute any effect to just early-to-bed-early-to-rise.
 
Dont forget industrialization is a huge confounding factor correlated with electricity.
 
TV didnt become common until the 1950s.
 
Id believe that disconnecting humans from sunlight-centered wake/sleep is a significant shift, and not ideal all other things being equal. But faces on TV strikes me as a very small thing, compared to how much else has changed in century.

The difference is that these Just So Stories are post-hoc theories, to explain actual experimental results. The experimental results dont go away even if the Amish and the stories do.

This isnt describing an experiment, this is a case study. In the hierarchy of evidence case studies rank very low down as they are highly prone to bias. Roberts expected watching television to have an influence and so it did - we cant tell whether this is due to an actual psychological change or an expectation on his part.
 
Nevertheless, its a fascinating idea, and ties in with my own experiences of depression. Further research is required (with more subjects), I think.

If you read the article, youll see how careful he was to avoid expectation bias and his arguments against it seem releatively convincing. Obviously a blind study cant be done (people clearly are going to know if theyre watching television or not), but he did his best. The study has since been replicated with several other people and I assume larger tests are going ahead.

Interesting to see that Seth Roberts is still into self-experimentation.  He was my professor in an introductory Psychology class at Berkeley back in the eighties.  One of our assignments was to come up with an experiment that you could test out on yourself.  (I chose to control my sleeping hours and track how sleepy I was during the day, the goal being to find an optimal amount of sleep at night for me.)  His self-experimentation page at http://sethroberts.net/self-experiment/ has some interesting links.

Title: What It Means To Be An Intellectual
 
A friend sent me an email this morning and at the end of it, almost as an afterthought, he responded to a quote Id sent him from an author praising books. He would say that, my friend replied, hes a writer.
 
I want to quibble with this statement  how is it that we can dismiss someones argument simply because of their job?  but doing so would seem bizarre. Theres a social norm that how much we discuss something should be roughly proportional to its importance. Mountains of print may be spilled on the issues of international relations but spending a couple emails discussing punctuation would seem dreadfully bizarre.
 
Theres just one problem: I enjoy deep discussions of punctuation and other trivialities. I could try to justify this taste  some argument that we should think about everything we do so that we dont do everything we think about  but why bother? Do I have to justify enjoying certain television shows as well? At some point, isnt pure enjoyment just enough? After all, time isnt fungible.
 
But of course, the same drive that leads me to question punctuation leads me to question the drive itself, and thus this essay.
 
What is this drive? Its the tendency to not simply accept things as they are but to want to think about them, to understand them. To not be content to simply feel sad but to ask what sadness means. To not just get a bus pass but to think about the economic reasons getting a bus pass makes sense. I call this tendency the intellectual.
 
The word intellectual has a bit of a bad rap. When I think of the word I hear a man with a southern accent sneering at it. But this stain seems appropriate  the idea has a bad rap.
 
And why is that? One reason is that many people simply dont like to think about things. Perhaps it reminds them of school, which they didnt enjoy, and they dont want to go back there. Another is that theyre busy people  men of action  and they dont have time to sit and think about every little detail. But mostly its just because they think its a waste of time. Whats the point? What difference does it make what you think about punctuation? Its not going to affect anything.
 
This is the argument thats often used when demonizing intellectuals. As Thomas Frank summarizes the argument:
 
The same bunch of sneaking intellectuals are responsible for the content of Hollywood movies and for the income tax, by which they steal from the rest of us. They do no useful work, producing nothing but movies and newspaper columns while they freeload on the labor of others. (116)
 
When I think of intellectuals, though, I dont really think of Hollywood producers or politicians or even newspaper columnists. But the people I do think of seem to have something else in common. They dont just love thinking, they love language. They love its tricks and intricacies, its games, the way it gets written down, the books it gets written into, the libraries those books are in, and the typography those books use.
 
Upon reflection this makes perfect sense. Language is the medium of thought and so its no surprise that someone who spends a lot of time thinking spends a lot of time thinking about how to communicate their thoughts as well. And indeed, all the intellectuals that come to mind write, not because they have to or get paid to, but simply for its own sake. What good is thinking if you cant share?
 
This contrasts with how intellectuals are commonly thought of  namely as pretentious elitist snobs. But real intellectuals, at least in the sense Im using the term, are anything but. They love nothing more than explaining their ideas so that anyone whos interested can understand them. They only seem pretentious because discussing such things is so bizarre.
 
This stereotype actually seems more like the caricature of the academic than the intellectual. (Its perhaps worth noting that most of the intellectuals I can think of arent academics or at least have left the academy.) Far from being intellectuals, academics are encouraged to be almost the opposite. Instead of trying to explain things simply, theyre rewarded for making them seem more complicated. Instead of trying to learn about everything, theyre forced to focus in on their little subdiscipline. Instead of loving books, they have to love gabbing  up in front of class or at office hour with students or at professional conferences or faculty meetings.
 
Not that theres anything wrong with that. At the beginning I declined to justify my being an intellectual on any grounds other than pure personal enjoyment. And here, at the end, I cant think of any better justification. Certainly people should think deeply about their actions and the worlds problems and other important topics. But the other ones? Thats little more than personal preference.

i enjoyed this :)   i think you are getting at it from a gut viewpoint that is very refreshing. you are right to contrast the intellectual with a person of action  certainly there is a preference in our culture for the latter  though even i count myself among the former  though frequently i malign that in myself; because to prefer to think rather than act is rarely wise.  i find the intellectual in myself is self conscious  he recourses  he anoints my creations  like a vulture he must devour that which i do.

You are not alone.  Theres a lot to be learned from understanding the little things.  Most interesting problems in the world have subtle complexities that appear to people as little things, especially when you try to pick them apart.  Without the little things, you cant truly understand the problem, and instead accept whatever simplified frame a journalist or academic has put the problem in.

Far from being intellectuals, academics are almost
  the opposite. Instead of trying to explain things 
  simply, they often try to make them seem more 
  complicated.
 
Is this supposed to apply to all (or most/ or the archetype of) people that work in the academic world? If it is, IMHO your description is just as far off as the (caricature of a) description of intellectuals that you cite. Trying to be precise may make stuff seem more complex, but then it is [often] necessary complexity (make things as simple as possible, but not simpler).
 
Of course there may be differences between hard sciences that deal with the physical reality, and  other types of sciences (some would say so-called sciences) where a lot of distinctions and precision seems almost arbritrary. (Forgive me for missing the correct terminology, maybe someone else can fill that in.)

Im not sure your clarification made anything more clear(!)  Why do you suppose academics obfuscate ideas?  Isnt it possible that they develop clear and precise terminology for things that the majority have no interest in understanding.  Thus to the (dare I say it) non-intellectuals their output only seems more complicated.
 
PS are you sure you didnt confuse intellectual and amateur?

I didnt say academics were this way; I said they were encouraged to be this way. There are very real rewards in academia for being obscure and very real punishments for writing popularizations.
 
Certainly, there is a need for developing precise terminology which naturally makes things hard to understand. But the problems go far beyond jargon.

Jeez, of all things, why are you committing the very same error that you accuse the anti-intellectuals of? There are academics, and then there are academics. Physics, Psychology, Economics, History, Philosophy,  each of these fields have their own cultures and each of them encourage and discourage different things. But of course, such fine-grained distinctions dont matter to the true anti-intellectual, um I mean intellectual, no?
 
Seriously, check out Peter Montgomerys paper some day if you can find it in your library. Its only two pages.

Hi Aaron,
 
It is often interesting to read your posts, regardless of if I agree with them or not.  Hmmmwell, this essay definitely belongs in the not category.  Why?
 
1)  Dismissing an argument because of someones job?  Nothing wrong with that - depending on the context.  For example, I would be inclined to give more credence to a software engineers views on what makes a good s/w eng than say a patent lawyer.
 
Of course, the patent lawyer may have been an excellent s/w engineer in the past, but the point is that profession is often an excellent first approximation to the authority of a persons argument.  And dont forget that some topics are inherently profession-agnostic.
 
2)  I dont agree that how much we discuss something should be roughly proportional to its importance is a social norm.  You need to define what you mean by importance.  Because, last time I checked, the number of people discussing the last episode of Desperate Housewives is probably comparable (if not greater) to the number of discussions around poverty.
 
3) Your definition of intellectual is reasonable, although Im not sure that a love of language is a prerequisite.  It is possible to be pragmatic about language (ie, its just a means to express ideas;  I have a good command of English, so Ill just focus on the ideas and not spend my finite energy on the vague intracicies of the language) and still be an intellectual.
 
4)  I find it humorous that you feel that intellectuals are undeservedly viewed as pretentious elitist snobs, and in the next sentence explain how they enjoy explaining their complicated ideas that seem esoteric or bizarre.  Apart from implicitly judging the merit of an idea based on its complexity, it seems kind of condescending when you put it that way.
 
5)  I totally disagree that academics arent intellectuals.  This is one of the stranger things I have read in a while.  First, to tar a group of people with a single brush is definitely an intellectual short-cut.
 
Secondly I have met and learned from many excellent academicians who stood out in their profession by virtue of their ability to clearly and succintly convey their knowledge.  (Hmmmnow that I think of it, my father is recognised by his field in this way for his teaching of anatomy).
 
And finally, it is possible to love gabbing and to love books, you know.  One tendency doesnt necessarily diminish the other.
 
And to back an earlier point, I would probably give your opinion on this less weight, precisely because you arent a professor (neither am I, but Im not making an argument against the professions intellectual-ness).
 
Anyways, the more I think about what you have written, the more I feel that the thinking behind it is flawed.  To wit - an intellectual loves thinking (agreeed), language (disagree), typography (definitely disagree).  Intellectuals are unfairly branded as pretentious and elitist, but they shouldnt be (disagree, in many cases it is deserved);  they just want to share their wonderful ideas (who judges the validity of these ideas?  What separates an intellectual from a crank??)  Academics are the snobs, not intellectuals (strongly disagree, because it presupposes Academics != intellectual, and other reasons outlined above).
 
Forgive the extended criticism; your arguments didnt make sense so I had to address them all.

The article only touched upon the job thing in passing, but ad hominem attacks are a classic logical fallacy. Theres a big difference between giving more credence to someones views because theyre an expert and completely dismissing an argument because of someones job.
 
The point about Desperate Housewives is a good ona and I should think about it a little more but I dont think it fundamentally affects my argument.
 
I didnt say love of language was a prerequisite; I said it was a correlate.
 
Ive updated the paragraph you mentioned in 4 to fix the things you criticized.
 
Once again, I didnt say academics arent intellectuals. I said the people I think of as intellectuals arent academics. Take Edward Tufte, for example. He left a tenured position at Yale to give public presentations and write publicly-oriented books.
 
What difference does it make whether peoples ideas are valid to whether theyre an intellectual?

Oh, and one more thing,  I misread one thing - that academics are encouraged to be almost the opposite of intellectual.
 
Basically, you still state academics != intellectual, but place the blame on the university.
 
Well, that is still not correct.  Based on my personal experience, universities regularly reward excellence in teaching (ie, exposition of ideas as per your definition of intellectual).
 
And lets say that academia actually does reward non-intellectual behaviour;  it still does not  follow that a professor must become the opposite of intellectual merely because the system encourages it.
 
Finally, your re-edited post still states This stereotype actually seems more like the caricature of the academic than the intellectual..  And this is still a generalization.  Feynman was an academic;  I doubt that youll find many people who would think of him as a pretentious elitist snob, or wouldnt think of him as an intellectual.  There are so many counter-examples to your argument that Im a little surprised that you made this claim.
 
Your analysis of what constitutes intellectualism turns into a bashing of academia.  A system which while not perfect (and what system is??) has produced and been associated with more intellectuals than any other body in history.

Kids are encouraged not to smoke. Does that mean all kids dont smoke? Just because academics are encouraged to do something doesnt mean they do.
 
Excellence in teaching, even if valid, is still limited to the small group of people who are actually in the university classroom.
 
Is Feynman the caricature of the academic? Hardly.
 
Just because academia has been associated with intellectuals doesnt mean it made them.

Montgomerys paper is interesting in several ways. As I said, its awfully short. At the same time, its quite easy to understand (one only needs elementary number theory knowledge!). And finally, it was actually accepted for publication.
 
Anyway, the differences in the disciplines are the institutional structure. Its all about how many of your papers get published where, and different fields have different ideas (among the reviewers) of what `should get published.

I wouldnt bother whether academics are encouraged to write popularizations, which pretty much by definition rarely advance knowledge in their fields. Likewise, as stated, a defining characteristic of intellectuals is their willingness to communicate their ideas. To which I say no, thats some combination of charisma and enthusiasm, but not intellect as such. Some very intelligent people may formulate their ideas best in private, perceiving the need to communicate as something of a nuisance. So I wouldnt impose much in the way of requirements. Im also bothered by your last paragraph. Whenever I hear anyone describe himself as an intellectual, I feel around for my wallet. And its not that people are too busy or that they dont like to think!

Even if we grant your premise (that popularizations rarely advance knowledge in a field), surely the larger public deserves to learn things as well? But I dont even grant the premise  it seems like popularizations help advance fields by both collecting and synthesizing their ideas and by encouraging the general public to share theirs. Most major new ideas come by transporting things that are commonly done in one field to another; this kind of stuff would happen a lot more with more popularizations.
 
Its possible that youre right and there are a large group of intellectuals who think deeply about things and dont communicate their ideas. Of course, Id probably never hear of them, since they dont communicate. Still, until Id like to see some evidence before assuming they exist.

I have no evidence other than personal observation: its often the quiet one who turns out to be the smartest one in the room. Or perhaps extroverts rub me the wrong way. But neither of us have substantial evidence of either assertion, only preconceptions of what we expect from intelligent people.
 
Id distinguish advancing a field from merely popularizing it; collecting and synthesizing strike me more as a shoring up than serious advancement. (Im sure we can name a field or two that remain static despite such periodic regurgitation?)  I think you may also be overestimating the value of interdisciplinary activity, and misidentifying popularizations as their main conduit.
 
Regardless, even if offering up popularizations is valuable, Id hire it out.  Think for a moment about what it would take for you to explain to a general audience everything you know about software development. Would that be a more productive use of your time than actually developing software?

GM - the company which while not perfect (and what company is??) has produced and been associated with more cars than any other company in history.  What a joke.  The point is that while thats what they sometimes claim they are doing, they do an extraordinarily bad job at it.  I agree with Aarons bashing of academia and would go much further (didnt see much of what I would call teaching going on myself).  Keep exploring these veins of thought, Aaron, regardless of how these mediocre minds respond.  If it makes sense to you, write about it and only make changes, after talking to others, if it makes logical sense to you, not for social or political reasons (Im thinking of your paragraph about sex that was excised from a previous post).

Thats a problem, you see, with the word intellectual: its largely a self-applied label. Just as ESR tells us that a hacker is someone like ESR, and Paul Graham tells us that a painter is someone like Paul Graham, we have AA telling us that an intellectual is  surprise!  someone whos like AA.

Obviously to some extent it reflects my personality  the observations are based on my friends, who I choose to be sort of like me  but the essay is only interesting to the extent that the attribute it discusses is. ESR and DWs essays are problematic because they try to claim a term that many people want to be  hacker, blogger  and tell you you should do it by being like them. My essay takes a trait that many people dislike and tries to give it a name. I happen to give it a name thats already in use, but it would probably work just as well with any other word.

Clearly, the onus is now on you to give concrete evidence for your thesis that this academia as a whole favours obscurantism over clarity. So far Im seeing nothing but an argumentum ad nauseam.

bi, youre going off the deep end here.  Just hang on and read carefully.  I never used the word intellectual in my last post so I could hardly have applied it to myself.  Read the first sentence of Aarons last post (about kids who smoke) and apply it to the first sentence of your last post.  I agree that were all speaking in generalities here (including you, who would generalize from two concrete examples to an entire system) and that none of us have bothered to list concrete evidence of systemic problems.  While I agree with most of Aarons statements about academia in the second to last paragraph of his original esssay, he hasnt presented specific evidence to show that it is so.
 
And Im not sure how he would.  These are generalities that he has extracted based on many smaller observations.  He could list those observations in more detail, but that might take some work, and Im not sure it would satisfy you.
 
As for what Maciej would say (WWMS :), Aaron, any creative work that attempts to secure an audience can be described as a big distributed act of participatory narcissism.  The issue is whether or not that audience ultimately finds that act to have any value.

How hard can it be to give at least a few concrete examples over a wide range of fields where academics were actively encouraged to write abstruse gobbledygook? Besides, whether listing such examples will satisfy me or not, surely its a useful thing  as he claims himself  to distil the evidence into a more digestible form for The Rest Of Us Unwashed Masses Who Cant See The Truth? Methinks a book with quotes that go
 
the concern to control his discourse, that is the reception of his discourse, imposes on the sociologist a scientific rhetoric which is not necessarily a rhetoric of scientificity: he needs to inculcate a scientific reading, rather than belief in the scientificity of what is being read  except in so far as the latter is one of the tacit conditions of a scientific reading
 
is clearly screaming for a simplification. (I mean, what the hell?)
 
Anyway, my point was precisely that you cant just generalize like that. Different fields of academia simply have different cultures, and it makes more sense to study the dynamics of specific disciplines first.

Im not sure if that paragraph is clearer in the original French, but while the translation is poorly-written English, the meaning comes thru pretty clearly to me: sociologists want their work to be accepted well, so theyre forced to write it in a scientific style, even when the work itself isnt very scientific.
 
As for good examples of being encouraged to write abstruse gobbledygook, just look under the category postmodernism.

A more colloquial term for an intellectual is a highbrow, and that has a clear reference to snobby elitism. It immediately brings to mind an image of a person that only considers highbrow culture (classical music, opera, theatre, dead-white-men taste in reading and otherwise) real culture, and condemns the lowbrow culture of the masses. In my experience, such cultural preference and being an academic or otherwise in a privileged position, does tend to correlate with snobby elitism. It is not that the person (when an academic) couldnt or wouldnt want to explain his own field to lay people, but that the person considers his other interests far superior to those of lay people, and doesnt (and cant!) explain these interests, and what makes them so great. Theres also the elitist/meritocratic tendency to think that people with lowbrow pastime interests should be governed by those with highbrow interests; those part of the dead-white-european-men cult.
 
It is these people that give bad reputation to intellectuals in general.
 
Otherwise it is a good article, though, but I dont agree that people dont want to think. They just dont want to think of the same things, and too much work can dull you so that you seldom are able to do that. An intellectual job is often just as or even more exhausting in this respect than a manual job.

bi, postmodernism did affect a wide range of fields. As the Wikipedia article on it states, Postmodernism has had large implications in philosophy, art, critical theory, architecture, literature, history, and culture. Since when is math the only field?

bi, the point were trying to make with your concrete examples is that they dont make a trend.   For us to sit here and list out large numbers of examples would take a long time and if the trend were talking about is sufficiently pervasive, it should be obvious to anyone who has read a sample of papers or been in academia.  However, I agree with you that there are fluctuations across disciplines so why dont you tell us about the disciplines that you claim dont suffer from being obscurantist and highly specialized?
 
I agree with tuomov that coming home from a busy workday can leave you unwilling to think some more, but we can think of a test that avoids that.  What do people do in their abundant leisure time (by historical standards), say the weekends or vacations?  I think its pretty clear that theyre not spending it thinking.  That implies that people dont want to think and I think the reason why is pretty clear: it takes effort.  People dont want to put in the effort when the gains are uncertain.

Ajay: You cant really compare leisure (weekends, vacations) with a lifestyle that isnt filled with work. Leisure is just time used to recover and regenerate for more work. People used to and schooled for work find it hard to fill their time not spent in work with anything else but torpor.

So your point is that everyone who is used to and schooled for work (who might that group include?  Everyone?), can do nothing more than sit around in a daffy haze once they leave work?  If so, why do a significant minority exert themselves in sports or exercise if theyre so wasted by work that they can do nothing else?  I must say Im taken aback by your assertion that nobody can do anything meaningful outside of a 40-hour work week (paltry by historical standards).  Are you referring to a particular group of people when you mention those with a lifestyle that isnt filled with work or are you suggesting that that hypothetical group is the only one that can spend any time thinking?  (I suppose that would include Aaron.)

Almost everyone in this society is schooled for work, even those fortunate enough to not have to work for a living. By a lifestyle that isnt filled with work I refer to something that isnt possible for most people in this society; something close to a lifestyle of play. Even those for whom it is possible, do not always exert it, the irrational pursuit for more wealth than one can ever use being connected with the protestant work ethic.
 
And it is not that people cant do anything outside the working hours. Its just that being ruled by the clock and bosses for most of ones waking hours tends passivise people; it is hard to take on any novel pursuits that have not been your daily routine for long. Its not impossible, but it takes more effort than it would be when you had a lot of time on your hands. And if you have to exert some capability (physical or mental) a lot by the clock (and that is a keyword), it does tax on your capability to use it outside those hours. On the other, not being able to use that capability also has an atrophying effect.
 
I can from personal experience state that not being ruled by the clock and very little by bosses (being a grad student), I tend to do a lot more thinking on other things as well besides my research, than while I had a real job. Those times one would impatiently wait the last few hours of the day to for the 8 hours to be full to be able to leave for home, and then crash on the sofa, watching telly. I actually do more work these days than back then, but Im closer (but not even nearly close enough) to a lifestyle of play rather than work.

Hmmm, so your thesis is that following a set 9-5 schedule and following orders from your boss acculturates you to not want to think?  Its clearly not the work itself that is exhausting you as you claim youre doing more work now and still thinking about other things.  I dont buy it.  Maybe you mean that having a more intellectual lifestyle in graduate school acclimatizes you to spend more time thinking, as opposed to a regular job that doesnt require much thinking.  But thats like saying having a job that doesnt require physical labor makes it hard for you to exercise.  Its just an excuse.
 
I checked out your blog, btw, some interesting stuff.  Youve got to change that dreary color scheme however.

Its a combination of being ruled and doing the work that is exhausting. Your capabilities are stretched beyond their limits by being forced to do work  work that you usually dont even like  by the clock. Personally, I cant do more than about 6 hours of work (including lunch and coffee breaks) in a stretch without becoming listless and exhausted, if what Im doing is not very exciting  and that can only happen rarely. And even that 6 hours is sometimes stretching it. After that it is time to switch to doing something completely different for some hours, and maybe do some more light work later at night.
 
Im not saying that a job that doesnt require physical labour would make it physicall hard for you to exercise, although along with the car culture (lack of utility sports), it does contribute to it, if you do not excercise otherwise. What work does, is make it mentally difficult to adjust to excercising, if it isnt already part of your routine.

The phrasing Postmodernism has had implications is so vague that its practically meaningless. Some time ago I came across this military history paper, a paper on linguistics, and a social science paper and I found theyre actually quite readable. Theyre all accepted for publication too. If postmodernism has such profound implications on these fields, Im not seeing these implications very much.

Based on the responses to your post, you have provided people something to think about (for those people who like to think). I agree that some people dont like to think to much because it reminds them of school or theyre lazy or maybe because they realize that at some point thinking is going to have to take a back seat to doing - at least if we want to take out the trash, or build a bridgeor whatever it is we are thinking about.
 
I tend to have a less rosy view of intellectuals than I sense from your post. I wouldnt go so far as to say I know what being an intellectual is, but I can say what my perception is.
 
I see intellectuals as those who value theory over practice, ideas over actualities and maybe mind over heart (e.g. the authors of Freakonomics). Someone who would like to talk, think or write about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin as they say. On the other hand intellectualism, or mental focus, is necessary to bring forward theory and eventually put it into practice.
 
Intellectuals brought us communist cultural revolutions and the associated human suffering and loss of freedom and attacks/censorship of the intelligentsia (artists, writers, professors).
 
On a side noteI noticed you referenced Alfie Kohn in one of your posts. I really like some of his writings as well. You might want to read some of Eric Hoffers work, notably The True Believer . When asked if he was an intellectual, Eric Hoffer liked to tell people he was a longshoremanwhich was true - but he was one of the brightest philsophers of the 20th century

Heres some good evidence that gobbledygook is rewarded:
 
The hoax was revealed by Sokal in an article for another journal, Lingua Franca; he explained that his Social Text article had been liberally salted with nonsense, and in his opinion was accepted only because (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors ideological preconceptions. Sokals hoax served a public purpose, to attract attention to what Sokal saw as a decline of standards of rigor in the academic community, and for that reason it was unmasked immediately by the author himself.

I read almost all the postings.  I find it interesting how we can get carried away with the details of what is trying to be said. I believe Aarons version of an intellectual is a breath of fresh air.  I understand it and can appreciate the thinking that leads to it, without judging the parts on its own.
 
Being a person of Business and not much of academia (other than a degree I can show for ) I am constantly reminded of how un-attached people are with the Big Picture of things (for lack of a more intellectual word) and how showing results now (action) is better than having a better understanding of the whole picture (ei: purpose ).
 
Enjoying deep discussions of punctuation and other trivialities and Aarons stating of That we should think about everything we do so that we dont do everything we think about  but why bother? is an exact version of my thinking of an intellectual, right or wrong, indulging in analysis paralysis comes to mind.  But I do agree, as well that many intellectuals should of course be allowed to analyze the minor details or the big picture by pulling it apart as a sport; Nothing wrong with that.  I go to comedy clubs to acquire the enjoyment of the artful and colorful way comics see the world around us in their own colorful language as well.  Comedy language and level of intellect is brutal, but still witty, still very real, and highly entertaining. Common Intellectuals just have another level of entertainment most of us (including myself at times) cant relate to.
 
Theres a social norm that how much we discuss something should be roughly proportional to its importance.  Now this statement alone really nailed it for me.
 
And here I thought dictionaries and encyclopedias were going to help me understand this better.  I love best the art of using your imagination and keeping it simple in your own language.
 
So, Aaron thanks for the clarification.
P.S. I had to use spell check to make sure my grammar and punctuation was to your standards. :-)

Title: Wassup?
 
Wow, its been a long time since we last talked. In fairness, Ive been hard at work. As you probably know, for a long time Ive been working on a startup called infogami. If youre interested in the full story, Ive written a long blog post about it but in short, last November I joined the amazing team behind reddit, merging our two companies.
 
Then, about a month ago, I quietly released the first version of infogami to the public. It was a very early version with hardly any features and I didnt tell anyone about it, but we still got several thousand sites created using the software.
 
Since then, Ive kept my promise of releasing a new feature every day, steadily improving the site bit by bit. There are a couple things Im particularly proud of, including our advanced permissions system which gives detailed control over exactly who can do what with your site and the blame feature that was put together by my friends Zack Coburn and Sean B. Palmer which shows exactly who wrote what in a document. And of course theres much more to come.
 
Of course, working on just one project all the time is a little much, so Ive been taking little breaks to work on new hacks. This weekend I built a little site called (for now, at least) Simple Amazon. I was annoyed with how slow it was to search Amazon  first you have to load their complicated front page, type in your search in the tiny hidden box, then click the link to filter it just for books and so on. With Simple Amazon, you just go to a URL like:
 
http://books.theinfo.org/lisp
 
and you get a listing of lisp books superfast with covers and links to price checks. You can also use links like:
 
http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262011530
 
to provide shorter links to Amazon.
 
Anyway, I guess thats about it for now. If youre interested in following my more day-to-day work, Im publishing company-related stuff over on the infogami blog. Currently its mostly just reports about our new features, but I hope to write more about the startup life and things like that.
 
All the best!

Title: The Disappearance of Thought
 

 
Neil Postman is generally considered a thoughtful liberal critic of technology and its deleterious effect on our culture. My friends praise his attacks on television and rethinking of education. But its hard for me to take him seriously after reading his The Disappearance of Childhood, in which he argues (p. 87) that television is bad because it teaches children homosexuality is normal and praises the Moral Majority as being the only group to realize this important truth. And true, he admits its an exaggeration to say such a situation necessarily and categorically signifies cultural degeneration, he does insist it clearly poses dangers.
 
Postmans argument is that childhood is the creation of the printing press, which led to a culture in which learning to read was necessary to become an adult, and thus children became a separate group. In the same way, he argues, the emergence of television, which requires no special training to view, is destroying the distinction between children and adults and bringing us back to that pre-literate age.
 
Not once does Postman ever explain why this should be considered a bad thing. Instead, his book simply assumes its obvious that we need to pretend to keep kids from naughty words (even though they know them anyway), that we need to make it hard for kids to learn about sex, that we need to pretend for them that political leaders are infallible, etc.
 
One is almost tempted to believe the book is tounge-in-cheek, an impression assisted by the preface to the second edition  the only place where actual children are ever considered  which quotes letters Postman has received from students who have read portions of the book and disagree completely with his argument that childhood is disappearing. They dont, however, criticize childhood itself, so Postman assumes they are in favor of it and praises them as a force in preserving childhood, a sort of moral majority.
 
And this, in miniature, is the problem with the whole book. Postman investigates the history of childhood and modern thought, finding it a creation of the printing press, and thus a social and not a biological entity. But instead of investigating whether the result was good or bad, he simply ignores his own work and proceeds directly to assuming it must be good. What we are witnessing here is not the disappearance of childhood, but the disappearance of thought.

Seems like warmed-over McLuhan, and like McLuhan, easy to poke holes in some of the less coherent premises. For one thing, the 21st century economy requires more educated students than ever before, so the importance of literacy shows no sign of declining.  As if the kids were going back to work in the sweatshops or out in the fields!
 
Funny, by the way, how conservatives are supposed to want to turn back the clock on all sorts of things, and heres one whos so afraid of doing so!

Postman is a McLuhan contemporary, I believe. Postman considers work training in school as part of the trend towards killing childhood. His literacy is stuff like the fine arts, rhetoric, etiquette, and prudish modesty, none of which seem particularly necessary for jobs the 21st century economy.
 
Postman is generally considered to be a man of the left (tho clearly of the Jerry Mander-style segment), not the right, and in the book he specifically attacks the so-called radicals for actually turning back the clock.

His problem is a simple one, and one that is nearly fundamental in our society. He assumes that childhood is defined by innocence (I dont know if he specifically uses that term, but I always hear it in discussions like this), which, to much of adult society, is a euphemism for ignorance.
 
With this positive-sounding euphemism in place, we proceed to assume that it is a positive property that must be preserved at all costs, until someone is not a child anymore, at which point they are allowed to stop being innocent for some reason. Its all very arbitrary, but thats where society gets the obsession with protecting children from dirty words (whose dirtiness itself is equally arbitrary), from sex, etc. Thats why society flipped out when Janet Jacksons right nipple was shown on TV for a half a second or something. Think of the children! How dare you allow the innocent children, um, during an age between toddlerhood and adolescence, to see a nipple! Its all very bizarre.
 
Also thats why parents tell pointless lies to their children  Santa Claus, for example. Oh, look, I lied to little Jimmy, and he believes me! How cute! How innocent! Of course, a lot of that is also a means of manipulating children by abusing their trust and impressionability. But parents do try to defend it as an innocent fantasy, and thus something unquestionably positive for children.
 
 I hate that word. That concept. If thats really what childhood represents to society, then Ive no objections to furthering the disappearance of childhood.

It all depends on your worldview, Aaron.
 
In mine, homosexuality is a failure of affective development, though of course I harbor no ill will towards such folks, being highly aware of all my own weaknesses in other areas of life.
 
And innocence is a desirable state for children. Dirtiness is not arbitrary, though clearly there are gray areas.
 
Why should an 8-year-old have to know in gory detail about all the ugly things that adults do in their worst moments? Murder, rapine, wars, etc.?
 
Thats Postmans point: Children will grow up soon enough to be adults, and, once theyre at or close to adulthood, will be exposed to the ugliness of parts of human life, and will have to deal with it. But he (and I) claim that, to grow up with a healthy sense that the world is not a terribly place, children need an emotional space thats certainly not free of all evil (not possible), but at least not full of it, either.
 
Our kids have grown up without television or radio, and now that some of them are adults (our eldest is 23, youngest 5), I think they agree with our decision and theyre a lot happier folks this way.
 
Besides, who has time for television, even assuming it was a desirable way to spend time (which is certainly is notat best its a banal waste of time)? Our kids have always been educated at home, and have way too much to do, between lessons, work, and (lots of) play. Kids need leisure to grow up, time for contemplation and reflection.
 
I can heartily recommend Amusing Ourselves to Death, in which Postman argues convincingly that television, even at its very best and most serious, can never be more than titillation and entertainment.
 
(Jerry Mander makes the same arguments, but I think a little more speculatively.)

Nobodys saying we should encourage them to watch television. But whats wrong with letting them say certain words or allowing them to wear certain clothes? Whats wrong with letting them know adults have sex and Santa Claus doesnt exist? The burden of proof is on those who would restrain children and they present no arguments.

Aaron asks if I have any evidence for my statement that kids naturally engage in fantasy. No, not really, but it seems obvious to me as a parent of two (eldest in kindergarten).  Young kids seem to be able to make a game out of anything. Im not a psychologist and dont fully understand why playing games is so important to development, but it clearly is.  Fantasies seem to be a similar way of playing with concepts, and I get the impression its a way of making sense of all the jumbled information kids take in.  (Only when you get older do you start to learn things methodically and sequentially.)  It may be related to dreams: how one of their purposes may be to help process each days data, and perhaps spin stories about what might happen the next day (according to one theory Im probably stating clumsily).  In more concrete terms, it makes sense on some level to believe in a benevolent Santa Claus who rewards well-behaved kids with presents.  The alternative concept  that self-control is its own reward  is a far more difficult concept for young kids. Same thing with the tooth fairy: losing teeth as a valuable rite of passage to adulthood.

I think perhaps you mean naiveness, not innocence.

Thats Postmans point: Children will grow up soon enough to be adults, and, once theyre at or close to adulthood, will be exposed to the ugliness of parts of human life, and will have to deal with it.
 
Even more reason to prepare children for what is out there. One problem I have with sheltering children from the realities of the world is that people tend to accept the way the world is instead of changing it. If you think the world is such a horrible place, do something to change that. Sheltering your children from it does no good. You could possibly argue that sheltering them could result in emotionally healthier adults, but I would counter that if you explain things well enough to an unsheltered child, love them, etc, it would be a non-issue.
 
Life is experience. I am Pro-Experience. I want to expose my children to life and be there to help explain it. The earlier they understand the world, the more time they have to process it and hopefully be motivated to create beneficial change. This does not mean I advocate sitting a three year old down in front of a television and playing pornography and violence. But I will not unnecessarily shelter them from life, thought, experience.
 
I agree with the sentiments of Mander and television, for the most part, turn it off. Teach them not to be fearful, empower them, and help them understand the world. Create a world where this argument doesnt exist, where the thought of sheltering children is foreign (unfortunately this can mean many different things to many different people).
 
But he (and I) claim that, to grow up with a healthy sense that the world is not a terribly place, children need an emotional space thats certainly not free of all evil (not possible), but at least not full of it, either.
 
Is it not possible to expose children to all of life, emphasizing that among all of this evil and hatred there is vastly more beauty, wonder, love, amazingness (couldnt think of proper word). We focus so much on the negative, perhaps in the hope that we will do something to change it. Life is wondrous. And if you expose children to that, get them to understand that, all the ugliness of the world will not harm them. It will motivate them, bring about their compassion, and compel them to action.
 
Actually, that sounds like the public school I attended. Lots of murders and rapes, even more suicide, very little educational content, and a huge emphasis on sports. It would be hard to design a better system for oppressing people without the majority of them figuring out theyre being deliberately oppressed.
 
Unfortunately, the public school system is designed to create an obedient work force. When people complain about the state of our educational system, I wonder if they have ever stopped to think that it is extremely well designed for its purpose. If you are a ruler, an educated/aware populace can be a bad thing.

I find a couple of Seans assumptions suspect: first, that some nefarious power is responsible for public schools shortcomings, as opposed to, say, institutional inertia.  In my experience, managers dont prize their dull, obedient employees.  And many powerful politicians have worked hard to upset the educational establishment. This focus on power relationships seems to be a recurring theme here, as when Adam suggested parents tell their kids about Santa Claus in order to prove they can lie to them, as if to establish their dominance. In both cases it strikes me as a very odd way to look at it.
 
Second, the idea that exposing kids to all sorts of realities earlier produces better results than sheltering them. One comment in particular jumped out at me: One problem I have with sheltering children from the realities of the world is that people tend to accept the way the world is instead of changing it. The ugly realities of the world include a lot of stuff you have no control over. My brother-in-law, my daughters uncle, died horribly of cancer last year, and her day-care provider the year before that, so I have recent experience on this front. Indeed, the fact that we have so little control over such large matters can be particularly distressing to kids who are developing the confidence to master their environment. You have far, far less influence on the world at large than on your child.

Perhaps I didnt make myself clear. You can certainly tell a 4th grader about wars, etc., at some level of abstraction, and thats inevitable, of course. But you dont have to show them pictures of the latest Tsutsi massacres (to pick one modern war at random) to get the point across.
 
And you dont keep them at the same level of abstraction all the way up until they enter college. On the contrary, our goal as home educators is to get them up to speed on all this nonsense (and a lot of other sensical stuff), though with a healthy world-view that says evil is not the last word.
 
Life is wondrous. And if you expose children to that, get them to understand that, all the ugliness of the world will not harm them. It will motivate them, bring about their compassion, and compel them to action.
 
Thats exactly our goal. In fact, the ugliness of the world may well harm them, but even this world is not the end, so we show them it cant permanently overpower them.
 
Unfortunately, the public school system is designed to create an obedient work force. When people complain about the state of our educational system, I wonder if they have ever stopped to think that it is extremely well designed for its purpose.

Exactly. Thats part of the reason we educate our kids at homewe want them to be highly aware of the forces at work that would dumb them down and make them part of mass Man.

Sorry, Aaron, but youre falling prey to a modern myth itself, that homosexuality is neutral. Its not, and those who counsel the men (mostly) who are caught up in a cycle of promiscuity and remorse can tell you volumes. Until just 25 years ago homosexuality was still listed as a disorder by the APA, but political correctness won the day.
 
An excellent book on this subject, if you can read it with an open mind, is Homosexuality and the Politics of Truth, http://satinover.com/hatpot.htm . And, no, its not a conservative rant about homosexuality. Its a very nuanced statement from a psychologist whos had years of working with homosexuals. One comes away from reading it with a huge sense of compassion and even admiration for those who actually struggle with this particular disorder.

Thats absolutely absurd  none of my gay friends are caught up in a cycle of promiscuity and remorse; theyre indistinguishable from my other friends except for the fact that they have sex with others of the same gender. Now whether their desires are innate or not, theres absolutely no basis to say theyre wrong. The only people who struggle are those who have to suffer the torture of authority figures telling them that they have an affliction.

It seems that the ones who have the most problems with agreeing, that childhood is not a happy place to be, are adults. As if they wish that somewhere in this crazy world, they do not understand, there is a place or time that is understandable. But understandable also seems to be seen as innocent.
Children are not innocent, there minds are made to copy what they see and practice that behavior. So teaching and showing ignorance, creates ignorance. And therefor you also can not hide your feelings, your ideas, your expectations from your children, they will see them in your behavior towards each other and others.
The reason parents want to manipulate their children, is not to give their children a happy childhood, but to keep their own happy image of their childhood intact. And that in a world in which we know, that our memory is most of all a system that creates memories by taking certain moments in time and fabricating the story between those point.
 
To answer Mike Sierra and point out something Sean Abraham said:
sheltering is keeping someone away from experience and assumes that the other will not encounter that experience later on in life. Standing next to someone while he has his experience and let him benefit from your experience, by talking with him, that is what parenting is about.
 
And the educational system was created to create obidience in large groups of humans, even the monestry school, in which it all started and that in a large part is the example after which the current school system is made, had that goal. Creating obidient workers. It may not have been a consious choice, but that is how it works.
 
But in the end it seems, that what this really is about, is our willingness to learn to question ourselves and our believes.

Norman says: sheltering is keeping someone away from experience and assumes that the other will not encounter that experience later on in life. Also: Children are not innocent, there [sic] minds are made to copy what they see and practice that behavior. So teaching and showing ignorance, creates ignorance.
 
The word ignorance strikes me as odd in this context; I find it more useful to substitute the word imagination. To shelter kids is not to keep them away from adult experiences as a kind of long-term strategy, but rather to cultivate this sense of imagination that is so often in short supply once you reach adulthood.  Any parent who believes or even wishes their kids wont encounter these adult experiences later in life is simply a fool. But the converse would be unfortunate: to foist a particular view of reality on a developing child may suppress their ability to imagine otherwise.
 
In concrete terms, Im not expending a great deal of energy shielding my five-year-old from the fact her uncle is gone, but neither am I about to tell her that no, she wont be seeing him one day in heaven. Cant imagine what possible good that would do. Likewise, shes aware my MP3 player was stolen out of the car in my driveway, and its a damn shame how its affecting her view of the world: that bad people might simply invade her space and take things away from her without being punished for it. Shes also aware there are soldiers, but so far Ive only been able to explain war in terms of boys who fight in the playground.
 
So Seans earlier statement that the earlier they understand the world, the more time they have to process it makes little sense in this regard.  First, it assumes a fixed state in which they understand the world  I still dont.  Second, some information is age-inappropriate; it either warps your view of the world or else cannot be processed at all. When told, for example, that her mommy was sad because Uncle Bryce was gone, my daughter looked puzzled for a moment and said: well, I have another uncle. (Dont mistake this for an inspirational statement; she simply cant understand yet what it means for anyone to be gone forever.) And to see how easy it is to warp a childs world-view, note that my daughter is now terrified of flushing the toilet after it backed up and overflowed once  my bad. ;-)
 
I havent read Postman, BTW, but I agree that the notion of a sheltered childhood is a fairly recent creation.  Id be more inclined to peg the shift to the industrial revolution, which generated sufficient prosperity to make institutions like child labor unthinkable.  From that point of view, modern childhood is more a luxury than an artifact, one I wouldnt be quick to jettison. As a function of prosperity rather than the relative importance of the written word, I doubt were reverting to a pre-literate state in which the distinction between adulthood and childhood is diminished.  Perhaps instead increased prosperity may be encouraging childlike behavior among adults, with both the bad and good connotations that suggests. Not sure if I believe thats the case, but I throw it out as an alternate scenario.

Forgot to mention: its one thing to assert that public education was created for the particular purpose of creating obedient workers, and another to provide evidence that is its continuing mission rather than its sub-optimal outcome. Im sure all the parents and teachers involved would regard that goal as abhorrent.  It strikes me as rather dull and obedient to hold onto that view and so quickly dismiss alternate explanations.

I do not worry about the imagination of children or adults.
 
The disapperance of imagination is not due to showing a world in its true form, but imposing a world view onto someone without the right of questioning that world view. And that is exactly what most teachers and parents do.
 
If telling your child that uncle Bryce is dead is a problem to you, and you see her answer but you have another uncle or I have two uncles you can have one of mine as not understanding what you are going through, then you do not see what see is trying. In her small way she is trying to use her imagination to understand what you feel. And as she thinks she understands, she imagines a solution that works for her and tries her solution out on you. If this solution does not work, she may try another, but also she may be stumped for another solution.
 
So in the end your problem with telling you child about death and stealing, might have more to do with your own feelings towards those situations then hers. Telling her would force you to look at your own emotions and would you be willing to do so, to be able to tell your child. (With this I do not mean to say, that you are not doing so, but reading your reactions, is giving that impression to me.)
 
And you are absolutely right, that teachers and parents have different goals for the eductional system, in comparison to what it creates. But Kant once said: What can be seen as good behavior, is not determined by someones intentions, but how his behavior creates what is good for others and if others experience that behavior as good.

Im probably not expressing myself adequately. I understand my daughters trying to make us feel better, but whats striking is how superficially shes able to handle such a weighty subject, even while shes nominally aware everyone dies. For her, the idea of an afterlife is comforting (grandmas cat is there!), and my unwillingness to present my own more difficult belief to the contrary can be seen as a form of sheltering, one I think is appropriate.
 
Likewise, its not that Im projecting a fear of thieves onto her. For me its just a loss of a few hundred bucks, and a minor annoyance. But its different for her, a completely unfamiliar risk to grapple with. Previously she didnt worry about strangers approaching the house to take away her prized possessions while shes asleep, and now she does. Not a major problem, mind you; we can keep reassuring her at bedtime that she has nothing to be afraid of, but its one of the things that discourages a shy girl from coming out of her shell.  So I believe my preference to shelter her as best as I can from such concerns at this stage, minimizing and ignoring them where possible, is wholly appropriate.
 
As for what suppresses imagination, I disagree much imposition from parents/teachers is required.  The process of becoming an adult requires developing a more focused kind of reasoning: more methodical, less magical, for want of a better word. A good deal of what makes people extraordinarily creative later in life is their ability to retain this more childlike way of thinking, but that doesnt mean we retain it by default. My instinct as a parent is to let it flourish wherever possible, arguably another form of sheltering against this thing called reality.
 
And I understand what Kant says  that ones good intentions may not bear fruit  but thats besides the point.  Seans statement that the public education system is designed to create an obedient work force [emphasis mine] suggests that someone is exerting control over the institution to produce that outcome for their benefit. Who is this?

I must admit it is rather difficult to know how you might shelter and at the same time let go.
 
And of course are childrens ideas less complex and more riddled with the influence of emotions, than those of grown ups, their ability to see relations is still developing. The simple reason for that is that their emotions develop before their cognitive abilities. This also means that a parent needs his experience with his own emotions and his cognition to understand what a child says and goes through. But it also means being honest about your own feelings. If you understand that your daughter is afraid, why do you not show her that you can be afraid, but also can conquer your fear. To me fear is a warning system to be careful, to start thinking, to analyse the situation. You might want to walk around the house with your daughter and look at every point she sees and feels something about and listen to what she has to say about it. Maybe her words are not eloquent, but if you give her a chance to speak her mind and be heard, you might be surprised by her insights. And you might even be more surprised by the fact that doing so she conquers her fears and becomes less shy.
 
Good luck.
 
You are absolutely right that nobody working in or working at the educational system is thinking about how to create an obidient work force. Everybody has his sights directed at giving every participant the best possible opportunity to achieve his best. But what I meant with intentions good or bad is that they do not count if the system creates something completely different then what it intended. So you are right, that what we get in the educational system is not the activity of someone exerting control. What we get in the educational system is because most participants have the best intentions, but are not willing to admit, that intentions are not enough to achieve a system that gives its best. We need to start to admit, that the system is made by humans for humans and that they influence each other. Sometimes their influence is positive, more often it is neutral, and sometimes it is negative. But the negative ones get talked about and create a negative press. Which creates a force in the system to cover up, not to own up.

I like what youve said here because it opened a new perspective to me. However, I feel that any type of experience encourages, rather than suppresses, ones ability to imagine. Our imaginations draw directly from our life experience, thus I am more inclined to believe that more experience equals greater imagination.
 
Likewise, shes aware my MP3 player was stolen out of the car in my driveway, and its a damn shame how its affecting her view of the world: that bad people might simply invade her space and take things away from her without being punished for it.
 
One could argue here that the person who stole our MP3 player isnt bad, but rather a victim of the emphasis of materialism and disparity of wealth in our world. I do not see that person who stole your MP3 player as being bad. I see them as not knowing any better, not realizing that their desire for that thing, that which they cannot afford but are willing to steal, is conditioned into them. By stopping on the person who stole your MP3 player, youre stopping too soon. We must look at what caused that person to steal, media, culture, exploitation. The real crooks of this nation and our world steal more than we could dream, sit in official offices, and do a good enough job at hiding it. Explaining that to a five year-old may not be too easy, but how about Its okay sweetie, apparently they needed it more than we do. Were lucky in that we can even afford one.

 
For her, the idea of an afterlife is comforting (grandmas cat is there!), and my unwillingness to present my own more difficult belief to the contrary can be seen as a form of sheltering, one I think is appropriate.
 

I find the belief in an afterlife as a hinderance more than a benefit, and thus not an appropriate idea to propagate at any age. From personal experience, shedding away my belief in an afterlife empowered me to make the best of my life here. I view this belief in an afterlife as a crutch. Things are bad now, but the afterlife will be so much better. To me, this is extremely dangerous. It translates into laziness, less of a willingness to try and make this world a better place, and a less concerned attitude about destroying this planet. Its much easier to just give up and bank on going to heaven. However, if people realized that this is it, this is all folks, perhaps people would be a little more motivated and passionate about making this a better world. However, looking into the eyes of a five year-old, certainly I would feel different.

 
we can keep reassuring her at bedtime that she has nothing to be afraid of, but its one of the things that discourages a shy girl from coming out of her shell. So I believe my preference to shelter her as best as I can from such concerns at this stage, minimizing and ignoring them where possible, is wholly appropriate.
 

The issue is so complex. Teaching her not to be fearful is extremely important. I liked what Norman had to say about fear being a warning system to be careful, start thinking, and analyze the situation. You can reassure her that there is nothing to be afraid of, but she is still afraid. I think understanding why people act as they do is an effective way to abolish fear. Normans suggestions also seem like good ones. Yet, to communicate such things to someone so young may be near impossible.

 
Mike, you have much more experience to draw on than I do myself, you have a child. I do not know what is better, I suppose it depends on your goals for your children. At this point in my life, were I to have children, my goal would be for them to be empowered, aware, and motivated to live their lives, experience as much as they can, and create positive change in this world. And by all of that, I am essentially describing the person I would like to be.

 
In response to my comment about our educational system being designed to produce an obedient work force, I would have to spend some time gathering sources and materials, however Aaron makes mention in this post about standardized testing and how its essentially gauges how well students memorize pointless facts. Yet, I feel that its evidence enough to simply look around and you will see an obedient work force. A population that can largely not think for themselves, nor care to. If our education system was truly designed to produce the best, brightest, most aware, and educated population, I think you would see more mentoring, more experienced based learning, less standardized testing. In fact, our entire culture and society would be completely different. There would be less of a class system, less homeless, more compassion, more empathy, less focus on materialism and consumption, less competition and more cooperation. I could go on, but I am tired right now.

 
This is a great discussion by the way, thank you Aaron, Mike, Chris, Norman, and the rest of you for your thoughts. Hopefully it will continue!

It is nice to know Sean, that my remark and those of others opened a new perspective. And I agree with you, that many experiences create creative thinking. However what I meant, was repeated pressure to follow the directions of others. It is comparable to what you say at the end of your reaction. If you want obedience, you repeatedly show people what you want of them and disallow them to have their own opinion or questions.

Sean: If youre saying all kinds of experience can only be good, I have to disagree. Traumas I alluded to such as death and divorce easily lead to self-doubt, depression (the antithesis of imagination), and all kinds of pathological behavior. Even if we exclude these, its not simply a question of more or less experience. Take two kids, one of whom starts practicing sex at age n, and the other at n + 4. The latter does not have less experience with life, just a different set of experiences, the value of which should not be minimized. Its useful here to consider why parents (now) oppose teen pregnancy. Parenthood is widely regarded as a positive experience, but not when it deprives teens of the remaining part of their childhood, a period allowing them to evaluate opportunities for the future that should not be squandered.
 
I think youre overreacting to my shorthand term bad people, one I assure you I dont use with my daughter. The point is from her eyes, its a meaningless distinction. She now has to get her head around the idea of people whose very goal is to hurt other people  inevitable, but a revelation that sure could have waited. And if someone takes away something of hers, Im going to tell her thats wrong, not the passive Its okay sweetie, apparently they needed it more than you do. Can you see why the latter would be a cause for anxiety?  (BTW: while iPods are readily fenceable and there have been no arrests, the cops strongly suspect a teenager from a few blocks away who is unlikely to be suffering from material deprivation. For what its worth)
 
Im also taken aback at your strongly negative reaction to the idea of an afterlife. Im sorry if you had a difficult time shedding the belief, but I dont see this is all there is and a future of being devoured by worms to be particularly motivating, either. Most major religions hold that good works in this life leads to a superior afterlife (or reincarnation for Hindus and Buddhists), so it appears to be a common motivating factor.
 
And I do agree the outcomes of public education are sub-optimal. My only point (perhaps a minor one) is one shouldnt assume the embodiment of malevolent power interests the way Bible-thumpers do for Satan.

On the other hand, we have other unnamed individuals whose interests are not served by their claims, and who arent being served by their disclosures.

Mike Sierra: While I dont believe that the poor quality of (public or private) education is due to a single Machiavellian entity, I do think that its partly due to the combined actions of various interest groups. I recently came across this tidbit on Boingboing, where Wil McCarthy wants us all to get excited over a new technology hes exploring  Quantum Wells. So I thought, hey, this sounds exciting, how can I contribute to it? Guess what, I cant; this stuff is being surrounded by a huge barrier of patents. Now you know where all the pointless facts to memorize come from: theres a lot of knowledge out there that we cant even use.

bi: I totally agree its the combined actions of various interest groups. Even if we were relatively focused in our vision of what an education ought to be, articulating a goal and implementing it in an institutional setting are two different matters. At times I wish we were dealing with a Machiavelli, since at least he was a smart guy. Every week I get this criminally endless, picayune email blast from the local principal, titled Thursday Announcements, and Ive been noticing that lately its been coming in on Wednesdays and Tuesdays. Based on what Ive encountered so far, getting them to retitle it might require a meeting with input from other parents.

Aaron,
 
I feel like we read different books - perhaps you havent been really fair to Postman In The Disappearance of Childhood Postman is very clear that he cant make any claims that childhood going is, in any absolute sense, good or bad. But he admits that he has an emotional and nostalgic attachment to the concept of childhood.
 
The book is useful because it helps us understand where this whole idea of childhood innocence comes from. Just telling people that it wasnt always this way is very helpful.
 
But the core argument is about the merger of the adult and child into continuous teen. Postman tries to avoid admitting he doesnt like this change but he cant help himself.
 
TV isnt the real world. For example, most people have extraordinary ideas about childbirth which have no relationship to reality. 300,000 women give birth around the world every day. Most of them do it at home yet TV would have us believe that unless it happens lying in a bed at hospital the mother will drop dead.
 
Postman (in 1982 remember) points out in this book many useful trends such as how children watch post-threshold adult TV and adults include childrens programmes in their list of all-time favourites.
 
The book, for me, is about opening debate on what society wants more of this trend of becoming a teenager from 3 to 35 or something else?
 
So what do we want?

Postman is very clear that he cant make any claims that childhood going is, in any absolute sense, good or bad. But he admits that he has an emotional and nostalgic attachment to the concept of childhood.
 
Heres Postman in the preface to the second edition:
 
of all the books I have written, this one has always been my favorite.  The book [] has a rather sad theme, made all the more unpalatable by the fact that it offers no strong solutions to the problem it raisesin fact, no solutions at all. If at least some trends toward the disappearance of childhood had been stayed or reversed since the book was written, I would have been delighted. (vii, of the second edition)
 
I certainly dont recall Postman saying any such thing and the above quote (favorite  book, sad, unpalatable, [in need of] solutions, delighted [to reverse]) doesnt sound like the kind of words you would use for something you have only a nostalgic attachment to.

Actually, most US television shows take place in the US, where 99% of childbirths are at a hospital. 
 
The book, for me, is about opening debate on what society wants more of this trend of becoming a teenager from 3 to 35 or something else?
 
If were going to have a debate, perhaps Postman should offer some arguments for his side, instead of simply assuming hes obviously right.

To find the disappearance of childhood painful and embarrassing and, above all, sad (pp xiii 2nd Ed) Is, in my view, a personal expression of regret but not an argument in any absolute moral or ethical framework that its disappearance is wrong. I think nostalgia is an eminently appropriate way to describe Postmans writings - in the final chapter he talks of keeping a previous age with its Monastery Effect alive through careful parenting. Is that not nostalgic?
 
Its true that unfortunately most US children are born in hospitals. Hence the relatively high US infant mortality rate and massive number of complications and caesarians. But in the UK much TV is made in the UK, in Holland its made in Holland etc.  The lowest home birth rate in Holland was 1/3 back in the 80s its gone up ever since. Nevertheless birth is shown in hospital lying down. Lying down is the worst possible position to give birth in! I digress.
 
My point was that TV is not reflective of reality, not even news is. So there arent as many murders, terrorist plots, coincidences etc as we experience in life. TV is hyper-real, a recent study in the UK (whose reference Im trying to track down) showed how characters in British dramas wouldnt be able to afford the cars and homes they were portrayed to own.
 
Im sure you know the jokes about how in Friends nobody ever works yet they live pretty well.
 
Perhaps Postman is at fault for believing his findings are obvious. But thats a truly extraordinary and brave thing for him to do when the massive majority wouldnt even be thinking along his lines
 
As he writes in the introduction:
 
What isnt so well understood is where childhood comes from in the first place and, still less, why it should be disappearing () As I understand what I have written, the main contribution of this book, such that it is, does not reside in the claim that childhood is disappearing but in a theory as to why such a thing should be happening. (pp xii-xiii, 2nd Ed)
 
The book is an excellent, accessible overview of the history of childhood. The second part was, for me, intellectually rigourous and held true to my own life experiences as a 27-year old man expecting my first baby in 5 weeks.
 
You wrote:
 
Not once does Postman ever explain why this should be considered a bad thing.
 
I disagree, again I think the introduction, for example, clearly lays out why Postman mourns the loss of childhood:
 
To have to stand and wait as the charm, malleability, innocence, and curiosity of children are degraded and then transmogrified into the less features of pseudo-adulthood is painful
 
You may disagree whether it matters if children lose these characteristics. But to find it difficult to take Postman seriously because he doesnt express his arguments is unfair. Despite your implications he never proposes a paternalistic society where politicians are infallible or any such like. He clearly identifies himself as a liberal and struggles with how the Right may have been more aware of the loss of childhood then his own political brothers.
 
Your entire piece misrepresents the book. In the new preface he doesnt praise the children for agreeing with him. To call such a heartfelt work tongue-in-cheek is extraordinary.

Saying you find it painful is a far cry from explaining why its bad  why do you find it painful? (Psuedo-adults arent curious or charming? Innocence and malleability are good things?)

He quotes children calling him weird, not very good, and arguing against him. Then he says their main lesson for me is that children themselves are a force in preserving childhood. It clearly seemed to me he was praising the children for agreeing with him, even after I reread the passage a couple times.
 
I just went back and reread the passage again and I see what you mean, though. I guess he must have been referring to the fact that the children werent arguing that the disappearance of childhood was good, they were arguing that it wasnt happening, which he presumably interpreted as support for the idea of childhood. Ive corrected the piece.

As I read the last few posts about the different ideas the book has created with its few readers on this weblog, one thing comes to mind. Nobody questions the fact that a human from an era in which childhood was something that was created through laws that forbid child labor, tries to answer his own questions about the disappearance of childhood. This is the famous dilemma of the fish researching water. For humans this would be their culture. Childhood is a western development from the late nineteenth begin twentieth century. It came to be, because business owners needed more and more skilled workers to create the more and more complex goods they were producing and handle the complex machinery they were using. So childhood really is a social construct.
<br/>
However to think that children agree with your idea that childhood should not disappear, is to assume that those children have the same idea about childhood that you have. Most children of today will take the information on television, internet, family and school about childhood as there reference points to understand what is meant by childhood, where mister Postman probably is from an era where school and family where the only reference points.
 
So what might be happening is that childhood is not disappearing, but changing into a form, that is unrecognisable to someone as mr. Postman.

Jason, I understand this is a digression, but I was floored by your statement: Its true that unfortunately most US children are born in hospitals. Hence the relatively high US infant mortality rate and massive number of complications and caesarians. High infant mortality compared to what, Sweden?  Worldwide, the mortality rate is about 50 per 1,000 live births, while for the U.S. its 6.5. (This according to the  CIA World Factbook.)  So I dont know what you mean by massive number of complications.  And pretty much by definition, the only place youd want to perform a C-section is in a hospital.

I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negros great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another mans freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a more convenient season.

After the 2004 voter backlash against gay marriage, a paternalistic straight white Republican took time out of his busy schedule to inform me that the left should not have tried to grab so many rights for gays, so quickly. Look at how the left had sabotaged itself, he said, pointing to the electoral results. He agreed with the overall goal of civil unions replacing government-sponsored marriage, but disagreed with Gavin Newsoms methods.

Title: Say Goodbye to Embarrassment
 
Ive decided to stop being embarrassed. Im saying goodbye to the whole thing: that growing suspicion as the moment approaches, that sense of realization when it comes, that rush of blood reddening your cheeks, that brief but powerful desire to jump out of your own skin, and then finally that attempt big fake smile trying to cover it all. Sure, it was fun for a while, but I think its outlived its usefulness. Its time for embarrassment to go.
 
Turning off an emotion is always a tough decision. I remember how a couple years ago I decided to say goodbye to anger. Sure, anger has its bright moments  you havent really lived until youve known that special joy of hurling a chair across the room  but its also quite time-consuming. Every time someone comes up and hits you, you have to run around chasing after them. And once you start getting angry its hard to stop  an angry person doesnt really want to calm down, it sort of enjoys being angry. So I finally decided to get rid of the whole thing. And you know what? I havent regretted the decision one bit.
 
Regret  thats another interesting emotion. I mean, what purpose does it really serve? Theres no use crying over spilled milk, my mom once told me when I started sobbing after I got milk all over the floor while trying to make cereal. I suppose thats true, I replied between sobs. Although maybe my tears will dilute the milk and make it stick to the floor less. But I was wrong  the milk stayed just as sticky. So maybe regret should be the next one to go.
 
But actually, I think its going to be frustration. Its not discussed much, but frustration is really quite distracting. Youre trying to solve some difficult problem but its just not working. Instead of taking a moment to try and think of the solution, you just keep getting more and more frustrated until you start jumping up and down and smashing various things. So not only do you waste time jumping, but you also have to pay to replace the stuff you smashed. Its really a net loss.
 
But thats a decision for another time. Today its time for embarrassment to join anger in the wastebasket of deactivated emotions. It might take some getting used to at first  when friends try to tease me about something Ill probably start to react before realizing theres just no need for it anymore  but before long Im sure it will seem normal. Even if Im a less normal person for it.

Well, another way to put turning off embarassment is having more self-esteem, just as turning off anger is being collectedboth compulsions are pretty smart ones to followso youre probably as normal as you started off being, despite the wastebasket-filling.

Regarding an angry person doesnt really want to calm down, I think youre mixing up the physiological response to an adrenaline rush versus a desire for an emotion. You know all about the fight-or-flight response, right? Its not something thats a fully conscious matter, though of course you can make efforts about it.
 
In many cases, Id say the trick is properly focusing anger.

Every now and then there is a post here that makes me say, No wonder I love Aarons writing. He may be a (talented) programmer, and he may be young, but he is definitely a man after my own heart. Ive done away with anger in much the same way he describes - and Ive banished regret that ones not so hard, actually. Frustration is a great idea! Its now next on my list. Meanwhile, I think Aaron will have his hands full with embarrassment it seems so visceral and involuntary but I suppose some would say the same thing of anger.

Funny, I have come to realize that I have a false sense of security on that account. I tend to embarrass myself without noticing it at the time.
 
Only to relize it some time afterwards. The approach of that realization is always a doozie! LoL

You dont have to do away with the emotion of embarrassment to not be embarrassed.
 
All you have to do is to know that you did what you thought was best at the time and be comfortable enough with yourself to be alright with that (and the consequences of whatever you did).

Try sarcasm. If youve repeatedly taken a moment to rethink the problem, and tried every sane thing you can think of, and nothing is working, thats the time to call on sarcastic troubleshooting. Try something stupid and pointless.
 
Example: communication between a computer and a new VTR is not working? Try scanning for channels. Dont let not wanting or needing TV channels, nor having any kind of aerial, nor protests about intelligent design or the utter pointlessness of the exercise stop you. Get sarcastic. (I wasted a full day on this before stooping to sarcasm. And yes, it was designed in such a way that it would not function without tuning the channels. Just like your car wont start if the clock is not set ;-)

Embarassment over an incident?  Emotions at the time can be difficult to reconstruct.  If the original incident involved anger, the lack of anger during the reconstruction may result in embarassment (as in I wouldnt have done it if I felt like I do now).
 
Anger during the original incident can be a positive, and someone found out the level of concern that you have.
 
Yes, give up embarassment and give support to your real emotions.

erying to turn off your anger will prove to be an impossibility.  much the same as trying to turn off your hunger, or thirst.
 
all humans are hardwired to deal with anger - even gandhi and the dalai lama.
 
buddha teaches through simple mindfulness you can transform your anger into happiness - a much more realistic alternative to trying to disable your emotions.

Bravo!
 
I wish I had the courage to banish embarrassment or at least the fear or being embarrassed, which prevents me from doing/saying a great deal of things that I probably should do/say anyway, never mind the consequences.
 
I think regret does serve a useful purpose. Its a metric to gauge your mistakes and to judge whether a risk is worth taking when you face a similar situation again. But it should be controlled regret  you should develop the will to turn it off when you realize that youre beating yourself up for no reason.
 
Thanks for blogging about this decision.

Hey, 
I think its amazing to be able to have control over your feelings; more importantly over your reactions to the feelings. 
I was wondering if this is in any way similar to mind control for phyical feelings (as opposed to emotions) like feeling warm or cold, etc. 
I know people who claim they decide not to feel cold, and manage brilliantly. 
Wish the world had more people like you! :)

I am not convinced that you can actually turn off emotions but I think this may just be an exercize in semantics.  I might call it transforming embarassment.
 
Something happens and then we have a thought about it.  Its not what happens that upsets us, its the thought about what happened that upsets us.
 
Eckhart Tolle says that emotion is the bodys response to a thought.  In the same way that animals have a physical response to a threat, our bodies can react to a threat by increasing heart rate, constricting muscles, etc..  These are instictive responses and emotions are also instictive responses but the difference is that while instinctive responses are the bodys direct response to some external situation, an emotion is the bodys response to a thought.
 
An emotion can be a response to an actual situation or event as well, however it is first filtered by our mental interpretation.
 
So, the good news is, if you change your thought about what happens, you can change your emotion about what happens.
 
He gives an example which I will paraphrase: I dont have a huge reaction when I hear on the news that someones car is stolen, but if my car is stolen, I would likely feel upset.  The word my makes all the difference.
 
The body is very intelligent but it cannot tell the difference between an actual situation and a thought.  It reacts to every thought as if it is reality.
 
Anyway, I loved your post.  Way to put yourself out there.
 
My next one to eliminate/transform is going to be resentment.  Because think its so harmful.  I dont know who to credit for this quote but I love it.  Resentment is like taking poison in the hopes that the other person will die.

Im with you on keeping anger and emberassment from taking over. But I prefer to think of it not as killing the emotion, but channelling it.
 
Sometimes anger can be a source of motivation. So can fear. Of the two, I prefer anger.

Aaron,
 
I dont think that you need to worry about being a less normal person for it. I think you need to worry about being less of a person for it.
 
Without going into a long philosophical discussion, the point is to let your emotions inform your thoughts and actions, not control them. Being a better person is measured by how you respond to your emotions, not whether or not you have them.
 
Be well.

First anger and then embarassment.  If we take this to its logical conclusion, then one day youll be like Star Treks Mr. Spock with no emotions at all.  Then you will have given up your humanity, and be only a biochemical computer.  An interesting life objective.  As for me, I prefer to rejoice in my humanity  all of it.

Perhaps you should also consider giving up intellectual arrogancesimply making an intellectual decision to stop being embarrassed presumes that you wont ever be making any mistakes that you would ever or should be embarrassed about.
 
As you grow older, and hopefully wiser, youll understand that simply deciding to deactivate a troubling emotion, under certain circumstances, is both inappropriate and dysfunctional. And inhuman. For example, suppose a serial killer murdered your parents. Or some bully sadistically slapped your face a few times and spit on you in front of your girl or friends.
Would you think it distracting or time-consuming to become either frustrated or angry?
Do you think youd have the time for taking a moment to try and think of the solution when there really was no solution? Youre talking about repressing emotions, which could be quite unhealthy.
 
And when you say an angry person doesnt really want to calm down, it sort of enjoys being angry, what do you mean by it? Is this merely a Freudian slip? Emotions are the consequence, largely, of evolutionary self-
protective and defensive mechanisms, part of the autonomic nervous system that responds to threat, whether real or just perceived, faster than you can think. They serve a purpose.
 
You are obviously a very intelligent young man, and I think you show great promise. But dont try to deactivate or say a final goodbye to certain emotionsyou may find at some point that life will throw you a real curve ball, and your emotions, especially if you have practiced a form of repressing them, will come out anyway and perhaps in a way that really ends up hurting you or others around you. I think Seth Finkelstein above has a fairly good take on the matter your comment refers to: the best thing to do is to better understand your emotional reactions and to control or channel them better, rather than think you can simply stop or eliminate themreality doesnt work that way, nor do humans with emotional and intellectual depth and true humanity. The recommendation above to consider studying Zen is also a good one.

Aaron, I liked very much your saing that angry people do not want to be calmed down and I completely agree with you.
But I have another opinion about embarassment. Its a feeling that shows the sincerity of a person, its a pure and positive feeling,that really expresses humans state of mind. Emotions and feelings can not be turned off because our world will be full of insensible and reserved people. It is possible to control our feelings, to restrain them, but not to remove them.

aaron, i applaud you.  when i was growing up, my father made us suppress our emotions for our own good.  that is to say, to react in an emotional manner to things would bring swift punishment.  i became an adult with no real experience at handling emotion.  it was foreign to me.
 
then at 21 i landed in the hospital (psych floor) and suddenly was told that perhaps i should try being human.  its the worst advice i ever followed.  i have spent the past few years vacillating between wanting to carry on as human or as someone else said, an organic computer (paraphrasing as i am too lazy to scroll up).  i think now that the answer is to return to my childhood ways.  ambarrassment and anger are two of the most visceral emotions a person can feel, and they are hard to overcome.  embarrassment doesnt hit me so much.  as my mom says, once your shame goes, your pride is next.
 
after 10 years and a lot of slaps in the face from life, i dont want to feel anything any more.  i dont think theres anything wrong with that.  if anything, being able to live rationally and not at the whim of some random chemical reaction is liberating, less stressful, and ultimately better than human.

Title: Some Announcements
 
My new Python web application library, web.py, is out.
 
An essay of mine about productivity has made the rounds. Im not sure its finished, but lots of people have already read it and loved it, so I thought I might as well tell you about it.
 
On a similar note, over the winter break I wrote a program called arcget to download web sites from the Internet Archives Wayback Machine. There are still a few more changes Id like to make, but Im unlikely to get to them anytime soon.
 
The reason I built arcget was so I could put up the Lingua Franca archive. Lingua Franca was a fantastic magazine about academic life that ran for several years before going bust in the recession. Their website, with many of their fantastic articles, sadly disappeared with it (and thus from Google).
 
Now you can read such classics as Oh My Darwin!, A Most Dangerous Method, and Who Owns The Sixties?.
 
Of course, these and many others are collected into the wonderful collection Quick Studies which, along, with Boob Jubilee is some of the most enjoyable and edifying material out there  combining both dazzlingly intriguing writing with meaty subjects.
 
Anyway, that should keep you busy for a while.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

Note that Lingua Francas editor, Alexander Star, later went on to improve the Boston Globes weekly Ideas section. As youd expect, theres the same pronounced emphasis on academic controversies.

You might also be interested in Warrick:
 
Warrick is a command-line utility for reconstructing or recovering a website that has been lost due to a hard drive crash, fire, failed backup, etc. Warrick will search the Internet Archive, Google, MSN, and Yahoo for stored
pages and images and will save them to your filesystem.
 
http://www.cs.odu.edu/~fmccown/research/lazy/warrick.html
 
I havent tried it and its not yet available for download but looks like it might be available on request from the author.
 

Regarding arcgets policy of retrieving the oldest version of any page, because generally the newest version is whatever lame site has replaced the site you want to archive:
 
If you know a threshold date for which you dont want any later captures, you can use the Wayback Machines ranged datespecs to limit the results you see. So, for example, the last version of the linguafranca.com homepage in the IA that looks like a normal active publication appears to be as of 20020207200457:
 
http://web.archive.org/web/20020207200457/http://www.linguafranca.com/index.html
 
You could then limit any search results page to return include only results before that date with an URL construction like:
 
http://web.archive.org/web/0-20020207200457*/linguafranca.com
 

Finally, also of potential interest for any such tools: theres an undocumented method of getting (pseudo-)XML lists of URL captures from the Wayback Machine: append a xm_ to the datespec portion of the retrieval URL. So the above would become:
 
http://web.archive.org/web/0-20020207200457*xm_/linguafranca.com
 
(I say pseudo-XML because theres no attempt to properly escape reported URLs, so you can get illegal XML from this interface.)
 
Caveat: this underdocumented/undertested/unsupported avenue could have other problems or go away unexpectedly. Ideally it would be replaced with a OpenSearch API-compliant interface, with some domain-specific special operators, but no such change is imminent.

Title: Colombia is Bleeding
 
Nellie McKay is having trouble getting her new album, Pretty Little Head, released, apparently due to the content of artistic differences with the record label. The best song on the album, and one that is particularly mentioned in this regard, is Columbia is Bleeding, her vicious portrayal of college life while students are oblivious to the animal torture going on around them.
 
However, it seems like the song might really be more appropriate for a different Colombia. Here, then, are those lyrics
 
another day begins
you check the news
ah-sass-ih-nay-she-uns
here come the footstep of the man wholl end your life
the rifles is fitted in
and there you are
the shot is targeted
then a scream
 
hold your placard up / cold and coffee cup
after go to a bar
hand your flier out / must admire
how dedicated you are
i dont wanna know if biz is boomin
or the goods you make are on sale
i dont wanna know bout your saintly glow or your noble show
or if you think you ought to bail
 
Chris Hogan / she had to run
last nightd been a lot of fun
but now its french / a little tense
she hadnt done the reading
there she sat / hoped to pass
didnt think to face the fact
that oh by gosh o lack o lass
colombia is bleeding
walkin down / off the bus
Vicky Lucas crossed campus was
thinkin how shes made it now
that successful feeling
walked by fast / hoped to pass 
no clue bout the shirt she has
and while shes sittin in lit class
colombia is bleeding
 
the union is in town
and there they are
the forces come on down
then a scream
 
everybody knows protesters are those
schmoes who dont have a life
see these businessmen seeking profit and
have to suffer such strife
i dont wanna know if the world is flat
or you cant check your email
i dont wanna know if your cell wont work or that guys a jerk 
or if you think you ought to bail
 
generalize, proselytize, verbs were spillin out their sides
as Charles Eise buys his supplies gets ready for a meeting
tried for track / hit the mat
didnt think to face the fact
that while hes thinkin man, thats wack!
colombia is bleeding
quite a snob he didnt tip
nice guy Rob watched the eclipse
and looked around / ive made it now
im just so glad to be here
made a pass / got hand slapped
didnt think to face the fact
that while hes mackin on that ass
colombia is bleeding
 
the catholic religion
decides to help the poor
while we rename the school in
which we train the men and
then a scream
 
theyre just criminals / make good worker cells
pushing drugs and disease
empires pretty fun / we got power, son
we can do as we please
i dont wanna know bout your drug war claims
or how its gonna fail
i dont wanna know if you need to show youre a real madman
or you think youre gonna bail
hail!
 
Tee-Tee Green / pressed mezzanine
ended up beside the team
and gave a cheer / got some beers
with friends who started drinkin
back with Zach said i look fat
didnt think to face the fact
that while shes under self-attack
colombia is bleeding
Rodney J. began to pray
his momma lost her life that day
had been a year / it wasnt clear
if he was safe or screamin
as he jabbed the bible flap
he didnt think to face the beast
of profiteering that killed the priest
colombia is bleeding
 
this is america

Title: A Brief History of Ajax
 
New technology quickly becomes so pervasive that its sometimes hard to remember what things were like before it. The latest example of this in miniature is the technique known as Ajax, which has become so widespread that its often thought that the technique has been around practically forever.
 
In some ways it has. During the first big stretch of browser innovation, Netscape added a feature known as LiveScript, which allowed people to put small scripts in web pages so that they could continue to do things after youd downloaded them. One early example was the Netscape form system, which would tell you if youd entered an invalid value for a field as soon as you entered it, instead of after you tried to submit the form to the server.
 
LiveScript became JavaScript and grew more powerful, leading to a technique known as Dynamic HTML, which was typically used to make things fly around the screen and change around in response to user input. Doing anything serious with Dynamic HTML was painful, however, because all the major browsers implemented its pieces slightly differently.
 
Shortly before web development died out, in early versions of Mozilla, Netscape showed a new kind of technique. I dont think it ever had a name, but we could call it Dynamic XML. The most vivid example I remember seeing was a mockup of an Amazon.com search result. The webpage looked just like a typical Amazon.com search result page, but instead of being written in HTML it was a piece of XML data which was then rendered for the user by a piece of JavaScript. The cool part was that this meant the rendering could be changed on the fly  there were a bunch of buttons that would allow you to sort the books in different ways and have them display using different schemes.
 
Shortly thereafter the bubble burst and web development crashed. Not, however, before Microsoft added a little-known function call named XMLHttpRequest to IE5. Mozilla quickly followed suit and, while nobody I know used it, the function stayed there, just waiting to be taken advantage of.
 
XMLHttpRequest allowed the JavaScript inside web pages to do something they could never really do before: get more data.1 Before, all the data either had to be sent with the web page. If you wanted more data or new data, you had to grab another web page. The JavaScript inside web pages couldnt talk to the outside world. XMLHttpRequest changed that, allowing web pages to get more data from the server whenever they pleased.
 
Google was apparently the first to realize what a sea change this was. With Gmail and Google Maps, they built applications that took advantage of this to provide a user interface that was much more like a web application. (The startup Oddpost, bought by Yahoo, actually predated this but their software was for-pay and so they didnt receive as much attention.)
 
With Gmail, for example, the application is continually asking the server if theres new email. If there is, then it live updates the page, it doesnt make you download a new one. And Google Maps lets you drag a map around and, as you do so, automatically downloads the parts of it you want to look at inline, without making you wait for a whole new page to download.
 
Jesse James Garrett of Adaptive Path described this new tactic as Ajax (Asynchronous Javascript And XML) in an essay and the term immediately took off. Everyone began using the technique in their own software and JavaScript toolkits sprung up to make doing so even easier.
 
And the rest is future history.
 
Both systems were relatively ill-supported by browsers in my experience. They were, after all, hacks. So while they both seemed extremely cool (KnowNow, in particular, had an awesome demo that allowed for a WYSIWYG SubEthaEdit-style live collaboration session in a browser), they never really took off.
 
Now apparently there is another technique, which I was unaware of, that involved changing the URL of an iframe to load new JavaScript. Im not sure why this technique didnt quite take off. While Google Maps apparently used it (and Oddpost probably did as well), I dont know of any other major users.
 
As my commenters point out  and as I well knew, but momentarily forgotten  this isnt really true. Before XMLHttpRequest, people used a trick of not closing the connection to the server. The server would keep adding more and more to the page, never saying it had finished downloading. Ka-Ping Yee used this technique to make a real-time chat system based on an animated GIF. And the ill-fated startup KnowNow used a similar technique with JavaScript to allow for live-updating pages.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.
 
December 22, 2005
 
Thats not quite right.  Theres a rich history of IE only apps fetching more data from the server.  Most used a hidden IFrame to simulate xmlhttprequest (I think thats how KnowNow did it, there were a number of web desktop companies around 2000 that were doing those tricks). To the best of my knowledge,  Google Maps used xslt parsing in the browser and iframes, not xmlhttprequest, a pretty circa 2001 set of browser tricks.
 
The real sea change, believe it or not, was Orkut.  From what I recall, Orkut was the first to use xmlhttprequest for something functional, if you call attributing stars to your friends functional.
 
Backing up Aarons point though, to give an idea of how useless people thought the xmlhttprequest was, it wasnt until Orkut that there was a real cross-browser reason to have implemented that command.
 
I back that up with a post from dave hyatt announcing Safari 1.2 in feb 04.
 
http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_02.html
 
I wonder if anyone at google might have tipped him off that xmlhttprequest might be important for more than rating your friends ;-)  Gmail was announced just 2 months later (although safari support came later)
 
Saying XMLHttpRequest is now supported, which means that those of you subscribed to Orkut can now rate your friends. ;)  seems a off the mark considering today only Brazilians give their friends stars in orkut, and millions of dollars are riding on the AJAX wave now.

Asynchronous webpages have a richer and longer history than the part you mention here.  Though there are probably others, KnowNow is the pioneer most familiar to me in this realm; they had interactive HTML applications in around 2000 or 2001.
 
XMLHttpRequest allowed the JavaScript inside web pages to do something they could never do before: get more data.
 
Thats not true.  There have always been a variety of methods to get more data.  In 1999, i discovered a way to get more data pushed from the server even without any Javascript or automatic reloading.  Even on a page of pure HTML, one can achieve this with a progressively rendered animated GIF; http://zesty.ca/chat/ is a simple chat program based on this idea.  Perhaps it wasnt so practical, but i thought it was pretty neat, and that wed be able to play interactive board games using this technique.  Maybe someone will yet think of a useful way to apply it today.

Im not a Microsoft apologist but I think credit has to go to Outlook Web Access as the first major use of techniques now referred to as Ajax. Unfortunately, you really need to try it to see how rich of an interface it is. Heres a demo: https://www.microsoft.com/seminar/shared/asp/view.asp?url=/Seminar/en/20031218TNT1-96d3/manifest.xml&rate=0
 
But Microsoft totally dropped the ball with the best version only supporting Win IE. For me, cross-platform is one of the key attributes of Ajax.

a9.com use the iframe trick. So do a lot of other sites - it has a big benefit over XMLHttpRequest in that the browser back button can be used to navigate back through hidden iframe changes, so if youre smart you can use the trick to get the back button to work more or less as the user expects it to.

async javascript and XML were here long before gmail and gmaps  im memory serves correctly, msft has had a pretty rich, asynchronous version of outlook web access available since at least 98.
 
in 99, LivePerson released a hosted customer service chat module that stores could add to their websites; its biggest selling point was how well it worked on all browsers, with no plugins or downloads.  It was all javascript, mostly using the iFrame approach (I know, i was lead dev).

Microsofts version is not even called XMLHttpRequest  for it exists long before Mozillas own implementation. In fact, Mozs version was implemented modeling after IEs ActiveX object sometime back in 2002.
 
And the usage of XMLHttpRequest has been there way before Google. OWA was an example. The Python app server I worked on used it to do XML-RPC calls back in 2002, and that was only because I saw how other IE-only webapps did it and stole the code :)
 
Somehow everyone is now praising Google for their innovation.

Whats the benefit to putting any Ajax-specific stuff on the server side? In fact, I dont think web.py even has any HTML-specific stuff! It might be a little easier to program if theres direct Python integration like Nevow does, but its not worth the user experience hit.

Title: Understanding Economic Jargon
 
These days it seems like economists are everywhere  the newspaper, the television, the school system, the bookstore  speaking in their own special brand of jargon, a language I call economese. Understanding what they mean is often difficult without formal training, so Ive put together this helpful guide on the subject.

If you can find the time (it is relatively short and wonderfully written) try reading D. McCloskys  The Secret Sins of Economics  by Dierdre McCloskey.
 
You might also enjoy  The Market as God  by Harvey Cox who is a professor of Divinity at Harvard.
 
While there is some (posibly a lot even) of thruth in your post, dont you think on could make a similar one for, say, mathemathics? Only you would agree with the math one, Id gather? The book Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences, by John Allen Paulos is fairly prechy too, and to some level a non-parody example of what youre getting at.

The problem with comparing markets to God is that markets are not a single omnipotent entity - they are a spontaneous order created by the interactions of thousands, millions, or billions of people.  A more accurate analogy to God would be government itself - people put their trust in government to be able to fix markets.  In order for a government to fix a market, however, it has to be omniscient and omnipotent - it has to understand the correct price for the good whose prices it controls in order to not cause a shortage and encourage future investment in a needed area.
 
In reality, this is not how government tends to work.  When government caps, say, gas prices - voila, shortages result, just as economists predict.  Government is not God, it is simply a creation (and design) of man.  Markets, likewise, are not God - but at least they are not created by human design.  They simply arise out of the mass of voluntary human interaction.

@econgeek: Ok, on the hand we have markets, which are very heavily influenced by what people believe. And on the other hand we have mathematics which are an extension of logic - and where the results are not going to change based on what you believe.
 
Gee, I wonder which one is more like religion
 
Besides, Daniel and econgeek, I think youre missing the fact, that Aaron was not comparing economics to religion, but he talking about economese (as he called it), which is how some people in the newspaper, the television, the school system, the bookstore talk in their own special language. Interestingly enough the reactions were like that of true zealots, finding their believes attacked, and having to defend them.

surely governance is a founding principal which we see displayed in pretty much every major civilisation in history, whatever the style maybe people need to be governed and involved in governance. once you privatise things (as we see in england - transport) things dont improve if anything they get worse, the train companies have a monopoly on their section of rail so prices are going up along with their profits but service isnt changing.
 
there are somethings which are so fundemental to the needs of society which need to be run by a body which at least claims to represent the people, not-for-profit. when the government opened our schools to market forces, now we have schools in inner cities struggling and others doing brilliantly with no money, decreasing social mobility and widening the wealth divide

Aaron, I totally understand your objection against economics. A lot of my friends at college are biology majors, and theyre always trying to persuade me that evolution is true. They keep on quoting scientific papers and the like, but how can biology be valid if it disagrees with creationism? I mean, if it contradicts my current beliefs, then it must be wrong. The whole field seems to be the most blatant form of left-wing propaganda, brainwashing young Americans into embracing atheism.
 
My friends are trying to get me to take biology next semester, but I dont see any point. You know, I read this book here, Case for a Creator, and the author made some pretty strong arguments against the field of biology. Unfortunately, since I dont actually know anything about biology, I was persuaded by a lot of arguments that are completely incorrect. But, since Ive read this book, and some articles online, I feel that I can safely say that the whole field of biology is just plain wrong, without having actually studied the subject with an open mind.
 
So I guess I understand your position of being able to reject an entire field of study without actually knowing or understanding the evidence and reasoning behind it. Its good to see we have something in common. Just remember Aaron, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.

Well, you could compare different societies (across space or time), to see how differences in their economic policies play out in the real world.
 
This can be complex, and maybe not realistically quantifiable, but I think theres enough evidence in history to give us general principles for how economics works.
 
For example, the Irish economy has recently been liberalizing, and as a result, basically two things have happened: 1)the economy has grown, more jobs, more wealth, and 2) Poverty, where it occurs, is sometimes more serious.
 
So, we could observe, with this case taken alongside others, that liberalizing an economy makes the median case better off, and increases the variance in income distribution. Just because people dont talk about it this way in the newspaper doesnt mean something magical is happening.
 
As for your comparison, just because both arguments arent backed up by fact, doesnt speak to the underlying subject matter. The religious argument, just by nature of being a bunch of baseless assertions, isnt an argument against god or the policies therein.  So maybe your real problem isnt economists in the media, its that there isnt any real analysis in the media

Yes, you could test economic theories. But as far as I can tell, economists dont.
 
Dont just take my word for it, heres University of Chicago economist Deirdre McCloskey:
 
Economics in its most prestigious and academically published versions engages in two activities, qualitative theorems and statistical significance, which look like theorizing and observing, and have (apparently) the same tough math and tough statistics that actual theorizing and actual observing would have.  But neither of them is what it claims to be. Qualitative theorems are not theorizing in a sense that would have to do with a double-virtued inquiry into the world.  In the same sense, statistical significance is not observing.  []
 
The progress of economic science has been seriously damaged.  You cant believe anything that comes out of [it].  Not a word.  It is all nonsense, which  future generations of economists are going to have to do all over again.  Most of what appears in the best journals of economics is unscientific rubbish.  I find this unspeakably sad.  All my friends, my dear, dear friends in economics, have been wasting their time. [] They are vigorous, difficult, demanding activities, like hard chess problems.  But they are worthless as science.
 
The physicist Richard Feynman called such activities Cargo Cult Science. [] By cargo cult he meant that they looked like science, had all that hard math and statistics, plenty of long words; but actual science, actual inquiry into the world, was not going on. I am afraid that my science of economics has come to the same point.

Amusing post. Im a fan of neither capitalism nor religion, and yet I love the idea of America  go figure. I think its pretty obvious that capitalism and organized religion go hand-in-hand, and the party lines between the pro and anti segments would be logically split down the middle. I would like to believe that pointing out the fundamental flaws of each system (which could be done once and then cut-and-pasted between the two, as done above) would be enough to catalyze a whole new form of thinking amongst the masses, but then again, we do live in a country where people are excited when a Wal-Mart opens in their suburb.
 
Given the general education of the average American, I often wonder what the people will be rising up in favor of when they do, eventually, rise up.

Thats just not true, Jana. The service has changed dramatically: avoiding unnecessary and costly safety procedures has resulted in years of derailments and dozens of deaths.
 
Your statement is probably more relevant to the privatization of water. For a country surrounded by water, where it rains all the time, and where the bottom half of the country regularly floods due to the effects of global warming, we now have some of the most expensive water in the world! Hurray for us! (We would have privatized even more, but we ran out of money.)

Heh.  Actually, of course, what the nattering nabobs of nomics skip over is that efficiency is not something we want from government (or markets, but thats another matter).  Efficiency is defined as maximalizing one metric in terms of another metric. One has to wonder: what happens if we choose the wrong metrics? Hampered, as it happens, by the fact that the market paradigm only allows a very limited set of possible metrics?
 
As for those efficient markets themselveswho amongst us dreams of driving the most efficient car? Arent there other values?

Actually, efficiency in economics basically tries the capture the idea of lack of wastefulness. (See for example the Wikipedia article on Pareto efficiency). If a given allocation is not economically efficient, then you could make someone better off without making anyone else worse off. Economists tend to think thats not a desirable situation; if someone can be made better off without worsening anyone elses situation, why not let them be better off?

It sounds quite nice when you put it that way, but thats not how things work in practice. In reality, economic efficiency is calculated to maximize very specific respects.
 
Your favorite computer company tries to increase efficiency by firing half its tech support staff. Now you get to spend hours on hold before your problem gets fixed. Do you feel better off?
 
Your local government increases efficiency by privatizing the bus system, which promptly increases efficiency by hiking the prices on working people and schoolchildren. Do they better off?
 
The UN is told they really should increase efficiency by letting US industry pollute as much as they want, causing the Earth to overheat and the environment to be destroyed for future generations. Think theyre going to feel better off?
 
The problem in all three cases is that the definitions of efficiency are weighted not by people, but by money. Youre just one of millions of computer purchasers, working people are low down on the economic scale, and our grandchildren dont participate in the market at all. So economics says screw em.

Well, I do think we are talking about different things. For example, if you go to the Wikipedia page for efficiency, there are many different meanings of the term. I do acknowledge that it is also used as a euphemism for things that people dont usually like, in business speak. I thought we were talking about economics as it is studied academically, though.
 
I would like to speak to a couple of your points in the other paragraphs. Regarding the computer company that lowers tech support staff, I would say that if a company does that and it is against the interests of the market they primarily serve, it could very well end up being a mistake which costs them. Sure, it might make them some money in the short run, but if their consumers really value that aspect of the product, in the long run they will change to competitors who provide what they want better. Then again, maybe people so like their cheap computers from Dell that they are willing to accept the low-probability event that theyll have a harder time with tech support.
 
Regarding the case of the bus system, people are paying for the bus system either way. When the government runs it, it is paid for out of tax dollars, and when it is privatized, it is paid for by the people who use it. Privatizing the system does shift the burden towards the people who use it and away from people who dont, and you might think that its good to subsidize poor people so they can live their lives (I agree). Economists tend to favor a policy like a negative income tax or the earned income tax credit for that, however. (The reason has to do with the distortionary effects of taxes and subsidies, which hide the true cost of what is being purchased). There is also the issue that government agencies tend to require a lot of bureaucracy and oversight that private companies do not, which means that it might actually be more efficiently run (fewer wasted resources) as a private company. Economists frequently find in empirical studies that the welfare benefits from government-run services like housing projects and so forth frequently do not outweigh the costs, meaning that everyone would be better off if the government just gave people the money they would spend on the project and bought private housing or whatever.
 
Pollution is a case where there might be externalities, which is a case where welfare theorems break down. In those cases, it might be welfare-increasing to set up a system like a pollution permit market.
 
So yes, the language and terms of economics are often misused in order to further peoples personal agendas. I suggest that rather than denying the validity of economics itself because shysters can use its terminology to sell whatever they want, we encourage better education in economics so that people are better able to think about these issues for themselves. In fact, I would say there are few people other than economists who passionately, lucidly and analytically advocate in the interests of the poor and powerless.

How is this use of efficiency a business-speak problem? The first result on Google for economic efficiency explains In a market economy, the goals of the rich are given more weight than the goals of the poor when calculating efficiency, just as I said.
 
The rest of Anonymouss comment clearly demonstrates the problems with economics I discuss in this article  we can see them by applying the same transformation:
 
if a company [lowers tech support staff] and it is against the will of God  [it could] cost[] them.
 
EITC was supported as a way to prevent an increase in the minimum wage, not welfare. The reason for this is that the EITC taxes the public to subsidize business, while the minimum wage essentially taxes business to provide money for low-wage workers.
 
The idea that government agencies are less efficiently run that corporations is another fiction of privatization, which I hinted at in my last post. The way privatized services are typically more efficient is not through less bureaucracy, but through scamming the poor. Take health care for example: in the US overhead is 13%, in Canadas government-run system its just 1%. (And of course everyone gets health care in Canada.)
 
Finally, Ill let Anonymouss closing comment refute itself: religion is often misused in order to further peoples personal agendas. I suggest that rather than denying the existance of God Himself because shysters can use it[]  we encourage better education in religion  In fact, I would say there are few people other than clergy who passionately  advocate in the interests of the poor and powerless.
 
Few would be convinced that the solution to poverty is more religious indoctrination. So why would economic indoctrination be any better?

If you believe that replacing key words in what people say to make it sound superficially like something you dont like is a logically valid form of argumentation, then I really dont know how to counter that. As a concerned humanist (and devout atheist), I study economics because I think understanding it can make many peoples lives better, and not understanding it can make peoples lives worse, even if solutions to problems are proposed with good intentions. Id rather we had a substantive discussion about specific ideas and why they might be wrong or right based on logic and evidence, not what it can be made to sound like if I replace words.
 
All I said was that businesses and political spin-doctors have successfully used the language of economics to suit their purposes, and that unfortunate fact does not itself invalidate the analysis. Just because an economic result runs against your intuition, it does not mean that there is a conspiracy by all those billionaire academics and development economists to keep poor people poor. The suggestion that the development economists and labor economists and public finance economists of the world (and its not that lucrative a profession) are all concerned with keeping people down is kind of humorous.
 
Yes, economic efficiency does count the rich more than the poor in some sense (I would say more accurately that it does not say anything about the distribution of wealth). The definition of Pareto optimality does not rule out a situation where a single person has everything and everyone else has nothing; that is efficient in the Pareto sense. However, that is obviously not sufficient to capture everything that we think is important in distribution issues, and so as the article you link to mentions, thats not typically the only criteria economists use in applied welfare analysis. Given that there are usually an infinitude of Pareto optimal allocations, focus on efficiency is more like a necessary but not sufficient condition for a desirable outcome; a policy had better be efficient, but efficiency alone does not necessarily recommend a policy.
 
Regarding the EITC and the minimum wage, this is a complex issue. A minimum wage increase can be like a tax increase on labor purchases. This can cause an decrease in the purchase of low-wage labor, or it might cause a price increase in the finished product the firm is selling (see section 6.1 of the textbook at introecon.com, for a more detailed discussion of all the issues). In either case, the public pretty much pays for it, whether through taxes or through the slightly increased price of almost everything they buy. If the EITC can make poor people better off with lower distortion on the employment and purchase decisions of workers and employers, why not do it through that?

Thinking economists are wrong makes me a conspiracy theorist? (I didnt even say anything about development economists!) So I guess McCloskey (quoted above) is also such a crazy person. As is economics journalist Doug Henwood, who says in his book Wall Street:
 
[Among economists, o]bservation and experience are distrusted, and theory instead is the lodestar. Given the bias of most theorists and theories, then, this style of economics can generally be trusted to produce results proving unfettered markets to be the finest principle of social organization.
 
Theres one sterling example of that dependable bias, the minimum wage, almost universally regarded by economists to be a job-killer. Their reasoning is pure Econ 101  raise the price of something (and a wage is the price of labor), and you depress demand for it. Therefore, boosting the minimum wage has to result in an employment decline for low-end workers. But in surveys of employers taken just before and after changes in the minimum wage, David Card and Alan Krueger (1995) showed that this just isnt true. They paused for a few pages in the middle of their book, Myth and Measurement, to review some reasons why the academic literature has almost unanimously found the minimum wage guilty as charged. They surmised that earlier studies showing that higher wages reduced employment were the result of publication bias among journal editors. They also surmised, very diplomatically, that economists have been aware of this bias, and played those notorious scholarly games, specification searching and data mining  bending the numbers to obtain the desired result. They also noted that some of the early studies were based on seriously flawed data, but since the results were desirable from both the political and professional points of view, they went undiscovered for several years. 
 
This also defuses the first half of your claim (that increasing the minimum wage will decrease the purchase of low-wage labor), leaving the second possibility: an increase in the price of goods. But I suspect this theory-based claim is similarly wrong  in practice I suspect the cost will simply come out of profit.

No, thinking economists are wrong does not make you a conspiracy theorist, but you paint with such a broad brush. We seem to agree on our dislike of the spin-doctoring of economics, but to consider MBAs and economists (with PhDs) as being involved in the same endeavors would leave me wondering why a bunch of (in my experience, passionately well-meaning) academics are so interesting in screwing people over.
 
I dont think McCloskey is crazy, but I dont think her opinion is as extreme as you think it is either. I read the Secret Sins a while back, and many kind words are spoken about economists before two specific methodological issues are addressed. There is some truth to what she says about qualitative theorems, but Im not willing to say that theyre useless. Economics is especially hard because it is plagued with confounding difficulties, so one way of trying to gain insight is simplifying the theoretical model you work with. Theoretical economics does get pretty abstract, but  even though the data required for much of the theory will never be available, analysis can often be done with simplifications, and the insights can trickle into empirical work. As I think McCloskey says in that file, applied economics is typically uglier and more approximate, but closer to reality. I really dont think McCloskey considers herself to be involved in a totally useless pursuit in which every result that everyone else in the field believes to be correct is wrong.
 
I dont know about Doug Henwood, and have never heard of him. To turn the question around a bit, are the faculties of the economics departments at MIT, Harvard, Chicago, and other top schools all crazy? Also, regarding the Card and Kreuger study, I dont believe that was the end of the story, and there is still controversy about their results. The Wikipedia article on the minimum wage provides more details about the various issues regarding their study and others. (Personally, I am not too gung-ho about the issue, and labor economics is definitely not my specialty, I just dont think that it would be so horrible if poor people were assisted through the EITC instead of a minimum wage increase).
 
Whether the cost comes out of profit or the consumers pocket due to a price increase depends on the price elasticity of demand. For some goods, it would come out of profit. For others, it is almost certain to be passed on to the consumer. For most, it is probably split between the two in some proportion. (The textbook at Introecon.com discusses this). A lot of empirical work analyzes who pays for a given tax or regulation.

If you want to know why economists propose things that hurt people, dont look at the individual economists (who are reasonable and decent people, doing what theyve been trained to do, thinking its for a noble end) but instead at the system that trains, selects, and hires them. This is sociology 101 stuff.

Im not a sociologist, so Im afraid I dont understand. How is it that we are so sure objectively that people are hurt by their proposals? How is it that all these economists, spending their lives reading and writing insane amounts of research and philosophy on the subject matter can miss what is so obvious to an outsider, and only hurting when they think they are helping?
 
Is there some specific problem you have with U of C or a specific economist there? Theres a wide range of specializations in that department, and many of their economists openly disagree with each other on fundamental issues. Furthermore, Chicagos price theory style of economics is a more applied approach than the sort that is criticized by McCloskey. (McCloskey actually defends Beckers work on fertility decisions in that file, for example).

How is it that all these economists, spending their lives reading and writing insane amounts of research and philosophy on the subject matter can miss what is so obvious to an outsider, and only hurting when they think they are helping?
 
So, the argument is, theyre trying really hard, so how can they be wrong?  Thats silly.  If their field is based on false premises, or if their techniques are scientifically bankrupt, then theyll be wrong no matter how hard they try.

a) I was defending their intentions as much as their conclusions, both of which have been under attack here.
 
b) Its still a valid point. Their job is to study and understand it, and you think theyre not aware of some issue you bring up? You think they dont spend any time making sure their methods are as scientifically valid as possible? I guess you can think that, but its kind of a silly thought. For example, I dont know jack about climate science (and it does share certain similarities with economics, such as the difficulties of measurement, and lack of controlled experiments), but Im not going to assume that scientists who tell us the world is getting warmer are simply failing to take something obvious into account and that any insights they give us are wrong. Plenty of people do make such assumptions, and I think youd find them silly as well.

I believe Ive said on this thread that Id read McCloskeys piece, every word of it. Again, that said, I dont agree with her views. Your argument is But theres this one economist who says its all bilge. OK, fine. I guess if thats the standard, without appeasing that one economist, victory is impossible for me.
 
It is true, it could be possible that all of economics, despite the brilliant people who work on it, is all wrong due to some simple oversight that a novice can walk up and point out. To believe that is the case takes a severe disrespect for the intellect of economists of the past several hundred years or a very high level of self-esteem. I dont think its likely, but theres no mathematically provable reason that thats not the case, so feel free to think that.
 
And yeah, Im having a hard time arguing against vague, nonspecific claims against the field as a whole. Im having a hard time believing this entire conversation is about whether or not economists should use a test of statistical significance as evidence for or against a given result

You claim youve read McCloskey and disagree, but you dont really respond to her argument.
 
McCloskeys first sin is that economists dont really do either theorizing or observing, just things that look like it (emphasis in original). She goes on to explain why what economists think is theorizing and observing actually isnt. Economic theories, she says, depend on premises that simply arent true (everyone is motivated by P-Only considerations, information is symmetric, people are rational).
 
Disproving this should be easy: just show us the great works of economics that dont make such assumptions or show us that these assumptions are actually true. If economics is worth anything at all, this shouldnt be very hard. I await your reply.

OK, I guess Im so fully indoctrinated that I didnt recognize the first argument as being the the assumptions arent true argument (I admit I skimmed some parts on rereading the other day). I have several responses to this.
 
The first one would be to just copy the entire essay called The Methodology of Positive Economics, by Milton Friedman into this little box (Its available on Google Print if you search for page numbers, and a large excerpt appears if you do a regular Google search). He addresses the the assumptions are wrong argument in depth in that essay, and I believe his defense is reasonable. In many things, economics does very well, in other things, economists are still struggling to understand certain phenomena (and the good ones will freely admit this).
 
The second response would be that economists have whittled down the number of assumptions they make about human behavior to a very small number. If you read the microeconomic theory textbook by Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green, they derive most of economic theory from 6 fairly reasonable assumptions about peoples behavior, and note when those assumptions might not be true (ie, why we might observe intransitive preferences, etc). In higher-level works, the number of assumptions can be whittled down to I believe about 4. Furthermore, many fundamental results, such as the fact that demand curves are downward sloping, can be derived without any assumptions on human behavior, and can in fact follow simply from the scarcity of resources (Gary Becker has proved many of these fundemental results along these lines).
 
The third response is that, as I mentioned regarding the Mas-Colell text, the assumptions are sometimes good starting points, sometimes not. The hot fields in economics right now are beginning to try to understand where those assumptions go wrong. Behavioral economics is a relatively new field that proceeds without classical economic assumptions (rationality, etc), and calibrates its assumptions to results from psychology. Experimental economics, another fast-growing field, is an attempt to perform controlled experiments on human behavior in economic and strategic situations. I am no expert on behavioral economics or experimental economics, but in my understanding, the big results coming from those fields dont overturn past economic results, but they can give us more detailed insights. Much of this work is still very controversial, especially from the old guard, but Ive yet to see any result come out of this field that has fundamentally overturned what the old-guard has found.
 
Finally, the assumptions that seem unbelievable at first can in fact be true in many situations. For example, in finance, it isnt unreasonable to assume that the main players on a market have all the same information, or that they are very rational. The fact that financial economics seems to work so well suggests that perhaps the breakdown in results in other settings is in fact due to the breakdown of these assumptions, and this is what behavioral economists try to investigate.

So I see youve tried tactic a (insisting that the assumptions are true). So can you give us some good examples of the predictive power of these theories then?

Im not sure what would satisfy you here. If an economist points to something that economic theory would suggest, and then finds support for it empirically in data, then you would probably not consider that to be a prediction in the grandiose sense that we would hope for, yet that is a common form for empirical research in economics to take. Unfortunately, economists are constrained in how much they can observe. Very few countries would agree to experimental macroeconomics, for example. When economists are called on to consider various policies and make a recommendation about the best one (and when their advice is taken) they cant observe what would have happened otherwise.
 
Can economists predict what is going on in the macroeconomy? Not at all; macroeconomics models most macro variables (GDP, productivity, etc) as random variables. I dont know that theres any hope for that sort of thing. Now, given that things like output and productivity are considered exogenous, macro can say some things about fiscal policy and monetary policy, the length or severity of a recession, the work/labor decision in business cycles, and other related things. For example, modern insights about monetary theory seem to have made inflation-fighting a tractable problem. If you look at Fed policy before and after Paul Volker (who implemented many of Milton Friedmans monetary policy suggestions) became chairman, the difference is striking in terms of how much inflation weve had; the period from 1980 onward is the longest period of low inflation and low volatility ever. Jeffrey Sachs has also had some success in advising countries like Bolivia during economic crises (Hes currently proposing strategies for lifting Africa out of poverty, but well see to what extent anything he proposes gets implemented).
 
Aside from the standard, uncontroversial results that economics predicts (rent control bad, deadweight loss of taxation, etc), specialized empirical economists who work in consulting firms or trade associations or hedge funds or government agencies do seem to have some success in making useful, if rough, estimates about demand analysis, and the near term effects of say, a new product introduction in a market about which they have a lot of useful data. Stuff like that. That sort of thing is rarely published in an academic journal, however. (I have had some experience working on this sort of thing in a marketing/industrial organization setting). Markets tend to move faster than government policies, companies are more likely to listen to an economic consultant than governments, and data is easier to collect in a timely manner for a small market or a company; perhaps all this helps explain why things seem to work better empirically on a smaller scale. Perhaps this is also why financial economists and industrial organization specialists seem to be in such high demand compared to other more theoretical-minded economists.
 
Personally, I dont think of prediction as mainly what economics does, and Im not sure how important it is to the validity of the field. If economics is mostly restricted to looking back and approaching welfare analysis like an accountant, I dont see why that cant be helpful and valid. Hopefully we could all agree that how resources are distributed and best utilized is a worthy thing to study, but were not handed a perfect world with wonderful data and the ability to experiment freely for everything wed like to study. Many fields worthy of study (in my opinion) find themselves in this position as well, such as climate science, sociology, and astronomy (especially string theory). What can you do? You do the best you can and look for what evidence you can, and I think that economists do a good job testing their theories empirically given those difficulties. If this prevents economics from rising to the level of a pristine science like physics or chemistry, so be it. Theyre lucky that the subject matter they study seems to be controlled by simpler laws than unpredictable human intelligence. I dont think everything that cant meet that standard is rightly called pseudoscience nonsense, only as good as the dogmatic circular logic of a religious evangelist.  What is important is how people approach the subject; if the best tools possible are brought to bear, and the available evidence is carefully weighed and considered, the insights can be valid and helpful even if they dont have the precision of the standard model of particle physics.

add another assumption (even a correct one) you tend to get an

measure how close it is to reality.  (Although, granted, this is due
to the perhaps essentially untractable nature of parts of the

Yeah, I wasnt familiar with the water privatization case in Bolivia. I was talking specifically about Jeffrey Sachss shock therapy program which pulled Bolivia out of hyperinflation in the 80s. My instinct would be that if you take something essential, like water, and go from the government providing it at a loss to giving some company monopoly rights over it, its going to get more expensive, which seems to be what happened. Im not really sure what the rationale was in those cases for doing it without introducing competition, or what they were trying to accomplish by doing it that way, so that is kind of weird to me.
 
I dont know much about post-autistic economics, and I cant seem to find any substantive academic articles from that movement. Ill look out for their results.

Perhaps if you substitute capitalism for economics. Im willing to bet that there are at least a couple economists studying the dynamics of a socialist economy.
 
As far as economics as religion goes, you can make the same argument regarding pretty much anything. Food is nourishment. Food is gods will. I can convert calories into work. God puts his will in me with food.
 
They question as to why capitalist markets dominate the world economy is probably best answered by pointing out that the major advantage capitalism has over other economic systems is that it is cynical regarding individuals. In capitalism, individuals are self-centered liars who dont give a shit about anyone else. ME ME ME. Unfortunately, this matches up pretty well with my experience when it comes to strangers(i.e., people are nice if they know you a bit or can foresee dealing with you more in the future).

The idea that introducing competition when privatising a previously-subsidised water supply will counterbalance any negative consequences is pretty daft. Its this kind of free-market-fundamentalism that leads many of us to despise what in other respects is a not-unreasonable intellectual position.
 

 
Market economics can generate useful models, but thats no reason to grant the discipline any moral or utilitarian authority; no more than we should take the explanatory power of Darwinian evolution as consituting an ethical argument for mercilessly slaughtering anyone or anything not perfectly fitting their ecological niche.
 

 
There are ways in which the world works, and ways in which we can represent those to at least partly understand them; and there are the things we value and the things we do. Do not make the mistake of confusing these domains.
 

 
In practical terms, an economic understanding of the way people behave, of resource flow and consumption and scarcity, is a valuable input into sociopolitical analysis and (where such is possible) action. But its no Bible. (Neither, for that matter, is The Bible  but thats a whole other flamewar.)
 

 
A proposition like people behave selfishly can give useful insight. It in no way implies that people should behave selfishly, or even that we, either individually or collectively, should relate to (cater for, gear public policy towards) people on that basis.

The thing about liberalising economies (such as in Ireland and Australia, since the float of the $AU and continuing through the so-called boom times to today) is that this sometimes creates only a perception of wealth and growth.  Australia is actually more indebted to overseas investors than ever before.  Just today it has been reported that the national (private) debt has hit a record $493 Billion, representing more that 51% of GDP.  This means that the Australian people are now a minority shareholder in the country.
 
What liberalisation has done, especially in the banking sector, is create easy access to cash which has unfortunately been spent on recurrent consumption rather than capital expansion (the federal government has injected billions in revenue into tax cuts and increased family payments, which is generally being spent on consumables, refinancing mortgages etc).
 
The nations indebtedness is frigtening and personal debt levels are at a record, with exposure to credit card debt one of things that could drive many to the wall once inflation kicks in and interest rates rise.
 
Certainly, growth is occuring, unemployment is lover than it has been for a while, contracting and sub-contracting is seen everywhere as former employees become small-business men.  However, the growth has been largely financed by foreign capital and has not as yet resulted in the required levels of productivity to tip the balance of trade in Australias favour and therefore, the national debt does not look like it might improve for a long time.  It appears that many people are more affluent than before, but what happens when the creditors come callin?

Dear Aaron,
 I have read your article. It is indeed very interesting and I was impressed by it,its unbelievable, but it is a right comparison, religion and economics are the principal things today. Still, I think they can not be compared in such a close way. They do not cross, they are parallel to each other, that is why a person can not choose among them.  It is  understood that everybody tries  to make his life better, to earn more money,so people  can not live out of market and religion has the same significance in todays life.

Theres one sterling example of that dependable bias, the minimum wage, almost universally regarded by economists to be a job-killer.
 
I am no economist, but I think that this counter-example is flawed.
 
Firstly, the notion of supply and demand is very commonsensical. You raise the price of something to very high levels, you would obviously want to buy less of it.
 
But then why does minimum wage help workers instead of harming them as the theory might suggest? One reason might be related to the actual market conditions under the influence of which a demand-supply equilibrium is supposed to be reached. For example, large employers might have a monopoly-buyer status locally and might be able to dictate lower wages. They are also specialists in reducing costs, which means they can afford to fund other strategies to find labor (e.g., transport people en mass from elsewhere). There could be several barriers preventing workers from migrating to locations where wages are higher. E.g.,
 
Lack of information - how do the workers know where the new jobs are?
 
Reasons related to personal preferences. You may not want to move to a strange climate and society.
 
You may have personal property that need to be transported or otherwise disposed.
 
Lets say that the cost associated with finding a new job is O (for overhead). The monopoly buyer will be able to get away with paying you Wequilibrium - O.
 
Minimum wages protect the employees against employers who will ruthlessly exploit their monopoly status and expertise in cost reduction to maximize their profits.

Thanks for the post above and the discussion to follow. I found many of the comments rather insightful. Im a big fan of D. McCloskey and I believe she is on to something in her writings. As a former PhD student, IMHO economics has become somewhat self absorbed and forgotten its roots as a social science. Its errors stem from largely believing ever more math can answer the questions posed rather than recognising that might not always be the case or even particularly useful.  Moreover, while many economists are sloopy and allow certain interest groups within society to misuse the insights provided by the field for social or political reasons and sometimes actively pontificate on these issues themselves thereby confusing everyone, economics as a field of study is very limited in what it can tell us about the right way to organise society which is often the ultimate question people want answered. In otherwords, economics is good at telling us what will - in theory - allow us to have more stuff. But it is not so good about telling us whether we should indeed take those steps. Again, thank you for the discussion.

Hi Aaron.  Im enjoying this discussion, as a former developer with a terminal masters in economics (who is extraordinarily cynical about what he learned there), who happens to be a big fan of Deirdre McCloskey.  (in fact, select quotes from Secret Sins are ON MY WALL as we speak.)
 
I think you are off-base if you are attempting to portray McCloskeys writing as a blanket condemnation of all economics (as it is taught in school).  It is very far from that, and frankly she would react with scorn if she saw the crude anti-economics hatchet job you started this entry with.
 
Just one money quote I beseech you to think it possible that the libertarianism of economics is a virtue.
 
Heres another  the insiders cannot believe that methods which they have been elaborately trained  are simply unscientific nonsense, having literally nthing to do with whatever actual scientific contribution (and I repeat, it is considerable) that economics makes to the understanding of society.

Aaron, you are unfortuantely demonstrating the aptness of the expression a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  Economists have, in fact, noticed the high price of status goods and have come up with a theory (signalling in the presense of imperfect information) to account for it.  Most of the time, the simple supply/demand story is pretty good at coming up with a simple framework to explain price movements.  (and BTW the Card study is very interesting but is hardly the last word in labour economics).
 
I must say, I always thought I was economics number one critic, and I never thought Id be in a position of defending economics.

Wow, its quite amazing to see views so clearly tinted by pre-existing biases and a lack of exposure to the world outside their little involvement.
 
For example: I think its pretty obvious that capitalism and organized religion go hand-in-hand. Although quite tempting to take as fact given the current association of religion and capitalism to the right and more independent thought and socialism to the left in America, isnt it quite shallow to infer that this is a causal relationship? Wouldnt even a very preliminary search outside of ones immediate environment bring up the inaccuracy of this statement? Take a look at Morocco  those pushing capitalism are more forward-thinking and educated, and are much more for independent thought, while those against it are fiercely religious.
 
Moreso, Aaron, its a huge cop-out to pander to the biases of your readers to produce pseudo-intellectual thought. Why do you so obviously reveal your hate for organized religion by comparing it to economics, and assuming this to be an extremely negative inference? My personal opinions on organized religion likely fall very close to yours, but I find it somewhat appalling that you show your biases so clearly. For an article trying to label economics as rubbish, youd think the author wouldnt delve into the same polemics he was criticizing.

@ Sencer: @econgeek: Ok, on the hand we have markets, which are very heavily influenced by what people believe. And on the other hand we have mathematics which are an extension of logic - and where the results are not going to change based on what you believe.
 
Ever heard of the axiom of choice? You think the results of mathemathics dont change based on wether you believe it or not? Do you have any idea how much we can only prove if we asume it?  Do you really think the reason the controversy over it died down is anything other thna the fact that we really need it (not wether logic says much about wether it is true or false).

Why is it that only left-wingers criticize economics? I wonder if they would be so gloomy about it if economists suddenly said the market is all wrong, the end of work is near, and that Cuba is a paradise for workers. Maybe you can help me figure out why people prefer to have no job at $7.25/hr rather than having a job at $5.15/hr, or why some individuals prefer to have a cheap, state-owned phone that doesnt work rather than a costly, privately provided phone that actually does?

Interesting food for thought.  I think its perfectly normal that people who view the world a particular way through one discipline (such as economics) would have a similar perspective which they apply to others (like religion).
 
In fact, much scholarship is being done to see the impact of certain schools of literary thought and historical analysis to a persons conception of God, religion, etc.  Much of the way English is taught in America right now bears a striking resemblemce to evangelical strains of Christianity.  For example, when analyzing a poem in high school, you may have a class discussion to figure out how all the various lines in the poem come together to form on coherent whole.  If one line does not make sense, you may re-asemble the pieces so that it all makes sense and adjust the meaning of the poem accordingly.
 
The underlying assumption here is that all lines must make sense together to form an organized, coherent whole, and that the author of the poem must have put it there for a reason.  Well, truth be told, the author could have simply said something stupid, or maybe that stray line is a reference to something we dont (or cant) understand because of something we dont know.  Maybe there is more than one way to interpret a text.
 
So what happens if you walk through life thinking that every piece of written word must make total sense as a whole and that all lines much be reconciled with the meaning of the entire piece?  When someone puts a Bible in your hands, a lot of people find that the evangelical or fundamentalist viewpoint is the easiest one to understand.  We are taught to be fundamentalists in school because our culture is seeped in this one form of literary criticism and the assumptions that come with it.
 
This is just one example of the way the perspective we form in one area carries over to another.

Ive seen people from both sides and certainly they tend to float to one or the other, but there are always times when both religion and straight economics mix in some way or shape. Taking this a step further, during these coming presidential elections in 2008, it had better be in the candidates best interest to swing with the religious people since they have such a major force in the voting booths. Surely the more religious Barack Obama is at the head of it compared to someone who appears more of a strict business woman such a Hillary Clinton. Politics and Religion are intertwined more than the politicians would ever admit.

Again Aaron, you say youve studied Economics. Where at?  Economists arent right about everything and they dont know how to implement things all the time but they are usually quite smart and economics is about more than money, its the most scientific social science there is.  A lot of modern economics is applied statistics.  Im glad in your infinite wisdom of your entire 20 years of existence youve determined that economics is wrong.
 
Let me remind you that economists are the reason that China has brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the last 20 years.  Let me remind you that economists are the reason Chile is the most prosperous South American country.
 
Economics cannot be compared to religion.  Youre such a hypocrite.  Religion is about dogma.  Economics is about data.  You dont like dogma and you dont like data.  What do you like?  Your own stupidity?

when I read your two perspectives of the same expression above, I started to smile a sociology scientist, Steven Pinker (http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/) developed a table of phrases/words, that can be combined by chance (using a dice f.e.), and finally, one is able to say extremely important seeming sentences without any sence ;-) 
Some years before, a german philosopher made a translation of psychological and sociological phrases (in german phrase means semantically empty or all the time repeated sentences, that fit to everything). I think, it was Carl Popper (see wikipedia, I?m not sure) who pointed to the extraordinary scintific jargons, whee vry often pretty simple circumstances are expressed in a woven and complicated way, that nobody at the end understands, what thy are about, but everybody agrees (better to agree than to convince, not to understand a word ;-)
Modern Marketing psychology develops this to create new names (in german we say old wine in new tubes) for new products to give them a new impression, a self-developing new ambiance, and positive interpretation form customer?s side. Creating a Uniqe Selling Propoal today is often an attempt, to distinguish oneself from aanother product, which is pretty similiar mee to - in times of internet, no idea stays exclusiv, so such USP search and reduction on verbal expressions is ssential for marketing economics and their financial (economical success)

I can only conclude that the purpose of economics is to keep people confused about economics.  Economics is what is in the economics books not what happens in reality.
 
In reality cars purchased by consumers wear out and therefore depreciate.  But economists have defined depreciation as applying to CAPITAL GOODS.  So cars purchased by consumers dont depreciate BY DEFINITION.  But when cars wear out in REAL LIFE real people have to go to work to make the money to buy new ones.
 
There are more than 200,000,000 cars in the US.  If each car depreciated by $1,500 per year how much would that be?  But economists have been ignoring this since 1945 though of course there werent as many cars back then.  But the total depreciation of 60 years should be a fair amount.  Like 10 TRILLION DOLLARS.
 
It is curious that double entry accounting is 700 years old but economists dont suggest everyone know how to do it with the computers we have now.

Title: Rewriting Reddit
 
Translations: Srpsko-Hrvatski
 
2012 note: This article was first published in 2005. After it was published, Django launched a RemovingTheMagic project to address some of my criticisms (though personally I still find it unusable), web.py inspired FriendFeeds tornado.web and Googles gae.webapp and others (though I still prefer web.py), and this article led to a permanent surge in Reddit traffic that still hasnt really stopped growing.
 

 
Over at reddit.com, we rewrote the site from Lisp to Python in the past week. It was pretty much done in one weekend. (Disclosure: We used my web.py library.) The others knew Lisp (they wrote their whole site in it) and they knew Python (they rewrote their whole site in it) and yet they decided liked Python better for this project. The Python version had less code that ran faster and was far easier to read and maintain.
 
The idea that there is something better than Lisp is apparently inconceivable to some, judging from comments on the reddit blog. The Lispers instead quickly set about trying to find the real reason behind the switch.
 
One assumed it must have been divine intervention, since there seems to be no other reason for switching to an inferior language. Another figured something else must be going on: Could this bea lie? To throw off competition? Its not as though Paul Graham hasnt hinted at this tactic in his essays Another chimed in: I decided it was a prank. Another suggested the authors simply wanted more cut corners, hacks, and faked artisanship.
 
These were, of course, extreme cases. Others assumed there must have been outside pressure. Either libraries or hiring new programmers I guess. Another concluded: some vc suit wants a maintainable-by-joe-programmer product. I hope he pays you millions.
 
The Lisp newsgroup, comp.lang.lisp, was upset about the switch that theyre currently planning to write a competitor to reddit in Lisp, to show how right they are or something.
 
The more sane argued along the lines of saying Lisps value lies in being able to create new linguistic constructs and that for something like a simple web app, this isnt necessary, since the constructs have been already built. But even this isnt true. web.py was built pretty much from scratch and uses all sorts of new linguistic constructs and  even better  these constructs have syntax that goes along with them and makes them reasonably readable. Sure, Python isnt Perl 6, so you cant add arbitrary syntax, but you can often find a clever way to get the job done.
 
Python, on the other hand, has problems of its own. The biggest is that it has dozens of web application frameworks, but none of them are any good. Pythonists are well aware of the first part but apparently not of the second, since when I tell them that Im using my own library, the universal response is I dont think Python needs another web application framework. Yes, Python needs fewer web application frameworks. But it also needs one that doesnt suck.
 
The framework that seems most promising is Django and indeed we initially attempted to rewrite Reddit in it. As the most experienced Python programmer, I tried my best to help the others out.
 
Django seemed great from the outside: a nice-looking website, intelligent and talented developers, and a seeming surplus of nice features. The developers and community are extremely helpful and responsive to patches and suggestions. And all the right goals are espoused in their philosophy documents and FAQs. Unfortunately, however, they seem completely incapable of living up to them.
 
While Django claims that its loosely coupled, using it pretty much requires fitting your code into Djangos worldview. Django insists on executing your code itself, either through its command-line utility or a specialized server handler called with the appropriate environment variables and Python path. When you start a project, by default Django creates folders nested four levels deep for your code and while you can move around some files, I had trouble figuring out which ones and how.
 
Djangos philosophy says Explicit is better than implicit, but Django has all sorts of magic. Database models you create in one file magically appear someplace else deep inside the Django module with a different name. When your model function is called, new things have been added to its variable-space and old ones removed. (Im told theyre currently working on fixing both of these, though.)
 
Another Django goal is less code, at least for you. But Django is simply full of code. Inside the django module are 10 different folders and inside each of those are a few more. By the time you actually build a site in the Django tutorial, youve imported django.core.meta, django.models.polls, django.conf.urls.defaults.*, django.utils.httpwrappers.HttpResponse, and django.core.extensions.render_to_response. Its not clear how anyone is supposed to remember all that, especially since there appear to be no guiding principles for what goes where or how its named. Three of these are inserted automatically by the start scripts, but you still need to memorize such names for every other function you want to use.
 
But Djangos most important problem is that its developers seem incapable of designing a decent API. Theyre clearly capable Python programmers  their code uses all sorts of bizarre tricks. And theyre clearly able to write code that works  they have all sorts of interesting features. But they cant seem to shape this code into something that other people can use.
 
Their APIs are ugly and regularly missing key features: the database API figures out queries by counting underscores but has no special syntax for JOINs, the template system requires four curly braces around every variable and cant do any sort of computation, the form API requires 15 lines to process a form and cant automatically generate the template.
 
I tried my best to fix things  and the Django community was extremely supportive  but the task simply dwarfed me. I just couldnt do it mentally, let alone with the time constraints of having to actually build my own application for my own startup.
 
And so, Lisp and Django found wanting, were left with web.py. Id like to say that web.py learned from these mistakes and was designed to avoid them, but the truth is that web.py was written long before all this and managed to avoid them anyway.
 
The way I wrote web.py was simple: I imagined how things should work and then I made that happen. Sometimes making things just work takes a lot of code. Sometimes it only takes a little. But either way, that fact is hidden from the user  they just get the ideal API.
 
So how should things work? The first principle is that code should be clear and simple. If you want to output some text, you call web.output. If you want to get form input, you call web.input. Theres nothing particularly hard to remember.
 
The second principle is that web.py should fit your code, not the other way around. Every function in web.py is completely independent, you can use whichever ones you want. You can put your files wherever you like, and web.py will happily follow along. If you want a piece of code to be run as a web app, you call web.run, you dont put your code in the magical place so that web.py can run you.
 
The third principle is that web.py should, by default, do the right thing by the Web. This means distinguishing between GET and POST properly. It means simple, canonical URLs which synonyms redirect to. It means readable HTML with the proper HTTP headers.
 
And that, as far as Im concerned, are pretty much all the principles you need. They seem pretty simple and obvious to me and Im even willing to fudge on some of them, but no other Python web app framework seems to even come close. (If you know of one, tell me and Ill happily recant. I dont want to be in this business.) Until then, it looks like Im forced to do that horrible thing Id rather not do: release one more Python web application framework into the world.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

Just wondering if you happened to check out TurboGears? (www.turbogears.org).
 
At a minimum, it too uses SQLObject. And they have the oh so pretty screencasts.
 
And I think that unsatisfactory may have been a better word, as opposed to broken. The word broken really has an implication of theres no way whatsoever to get this thng to work, which is obviously not the case for Django. It just happened to be the case for what you wanted to do with it.

Problem one with TurboGears is that their website is hideous. Other problems from a skim: It creates a lot of files, Kid seems pretty unfriendly, CherryPy doesnt let you pick your own URL scheme, and functions seem to be distributed randomly across cherrypy and turbogears modules

The Reddit guys have started a funny geek drama.  The snarkyness of the language camps is killing me.
 
To people that might be sitting on the fence about which language is best or most powerful:  try them and find out for yourself.  These advocacy outbursts are just as much about justifying the zealots choice as they are about influencing yours.
 
Whats P.G. talking about?  Could one of the projects for next years Summer Founders be to finish Arc?  The Lisp guys need some cheering up.

Always seems to me that web publishing is a fairly complex business, theres just lots of different things that need to be handled: form processing, ORM, templates/output, then app level stuff, pagination, search, permissions, admin, etc, etc. And thats before you get into your own app code. Web developers should not rewrite this code per app, their platform should do it. Their platform should be a large OSS project to provide security, management and code reuse benefits.
 
Django, Rails, even Zope 3, try to provide that answer: lots of code for almost everything you need and an API for putting together your own stuff, with the emphasis on cohesion. From what youve revealed of web.py so far it doesnt seem to provide cohesion, the glueing-together tasks need to be done and done again. Django may have magic innards, but it provides more code for solving more tasks. Zero to simple site time might be the same, but zero to site with all the niceties required by an increasingly savvy audience will always be quicker with a more full-featured environment.

OK
 
So what exactly is the problem with Cheetah?
 
Its a templating mini-language. These things always turn into unmaintainable goo. As templating goo languages go, its not that bad. Functions are split across CherryPy and Turbogears because they are reusing CherryPy, which has been debugged.
 
Still, I can understand the file layout objection. web.py seems like a pretty similar setup to TBNL, which I really like. Let me hazard a guess about the proximate cause: CMUCL on FreeBSD, UFFI, and/or mod_lisp falling over for no good reason.
 
Dont understand the Cheetah choice. What are the benefits that make you favor Cheetah over Kid?

I think in many cases, the framework is more important as the language itself. Im inclined to think web.py must do something right if the Reddit guys gave up TBNL for it. I look forward to the public release; its one more sharp thing for my toolbox.

Ive tried out TurboGears and Django, and I agree that they involves too many files and too much boilerplate code.  Still, I really like most of the decisions that went into TurboGears.  (Web.py looks even better in a lot of ways, and I look forward to using it.)
 
Regarding Kid:  Ive worked in a lot of templating systems and template languages (Cheetah, CFML, Mason, ASP, PHP) and Kid is my favorite.  But I realize that this depends a lot on use cases and on personal aesthetics.
 
Kid involves a small amount of bondage-and-discipline, which seems like a contrast with Python.  But I really like the feel of Kid, and I find that it has important benefits.  For example, Kids guarantees about well-formed XML mean that data that you insert is escaped as needed unless you explicitly say otherwise.  Among other things, this helps Kid avoid the insecure by default problem in most templating systems, where the programmer has to escape every output string explicitly or cause cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities.

Broken usually means that something doesnt work the way it was intended, and is often seen as disparaging to the designers or implementors of the artifact.  I certainly admit to having been guilty of using the word in a disparaging manner, too.  But you should know that its not a respectful way to talk about someone elses work.
 
As for a better word, well, respect isnt something that comes across merely by the choice of a single word.  Im still working on learning it myself.

Sorry, but actually all that above on perfect API and stuff just reads to me as yet another case of not invented here. Its fun to discuss web frameworks (as it is fun to write one or two or more), but its not fun to have highly emotional attacks like cant design a decent API that are just based on personal preference, stated as universal truth

Nice to see the HTTP method thing. Just one question about it:
From the tutorial, I gather that youre mapping URIs to classes by using regular expressions (Im  not sure whether I prefer this over the cherrypy approach, but thats another matter). The leftover captures seem to get passed to the GET, (or POST or whatever) method. Any reason why not to the init method? (URI gets resolved to an object, method gets called on that object, instead of: URI gets partially resolved, further resolving is done in the method)

That statement is obviously absurd. Among the many counter examples is Ruby on Rails. I dont understand why reddit went with a closed solution in python that currently has a small user base (no offense) rather than the rapidly swelling, open source RoR, written in Ruby which, imho, is much shinier. I wonder if they considered Rails and found it technically lacking, or if they suffer from some kind of popularity snobbery (hence lisp, but there it did them a favour) which prevents them using saomething that everyone else uses.

Yes, web.py looks very nice, but only because I now nothing about it. Others (Django, TG, ) have published their source so it is easy to comment: favorably or not. web.py yet remains to be seen: so far it looks like simple url to function mapper with everything else left to the app developer.

IMO the web app problem has not found any single framework simply because the problem of building web applications can be very easily modularized, and there are already excellent modules that provide specific orthogonal functionalities.
 
When I also faced the task of having to write web app code that I did not want to commit to any framework (I want future flexibility of changing the components), I defined a set of interfaces (http://furius.ca/indra), and then provided them by plugging a variety of existing and non-existing modules (I had to write some of the modules, e.g. http://furius.ca/atocha for form processing, http://furius.ca/htmlout for HTML output).
 
The fact is that you do not need a framework.  You need to choose the technology youd like to use (i.e. do you need templates?  What database back-end are you using?  What language do you want to write to?  How do you want to bind the URLs to code?  etc.) and then pick the modules and put them together.
 
Unfortunately, this is a fair bit of work in itself, which is why people build frameworks.  I have yet to see a framework which works for everyone.
 
I dont think this problem has a solution.  You either bend over to the limits of a framework, or you assemble your own.
 
As for LISP: it would be worthwhile looking into a way to access the Python libraries from a LISP interpreter.  Sure enough, the interfaces are not going to be very lispy and the speed is going to be as slow as Python (that is, much slower), but it would at least provide a good set of well-tested libraries to work from.  I would love to see that happen

Aaron: Looks very nice-in the style of OpenACS and WWDJBD (What Would DJB Do :) When I was doing some web programming a little while back, I tried out several of the Python frameworks. But none of them gave me an easy way to do the exact two things you mentioned: abstract URI mapping, and ability to distinguish between the different HTTP verbs. IMHO, these are the basic building blocks of any web application or framework; the rest of the infrastructure can be built around them.
 
I look forward to the release of web.py-keep up the good work :)

What an API can do is an objective question, not a personal preference. How easy it is to use is, ultimately, also an objective question  you can look at its the experience across a large number of users. I sat down with the reddit team and watched them try to use the Django API and the web.py API. For both of them I did my best to help modify the API so things were easier, but it became pretty clear which won out. Sure, its a small sample size, but I think the results wouldnt be much different with a larger one.
 
As for the people calling web.py closed source, it seems a little silly  it says right on the web site that its free software. I just thought Id clean it up before I released it.

It was game over for Lisp when the authors limited themselves to free implementations of Lisp (even though they could have purchased a commercial version).
 
Then they chose to do cross platform development on Mac and FreeBSD, which no free lisp supports (but which some commericial lisps support).
 
If Id seen this on a business plan Id have rejected it right away.   It was a plan doomed to failure.  Sadly it was Lisp that got a black eye in this and not the people who decided to start the project with such crazy preconditions.
 
There are commercical Lisps which can support development across Mac OS and FreeBSD and which have serious libraries for web programming and database access.   If one of these were chosen there would have been no need to switch to a lesser language.

A few quick comments:
 
Django is open source, not closed as robbies message implied. (To be fair, robbie may have only been referring to web.py as closed, but his message could have been interpreted either way.)
 
As far as Python templating goes, Spyce is easily the best in terms of flexibility and ease of integration of HTML and complex coding. (See this new Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyce ) If only it wasnt such a jumbled mess in places.
 
I have already used an alternative templating system (HTML Template  http://freespace.virgin.net/hamish.sanderson/htmltemplate.html ) within a Django app and that worked fine. I intend to try Django/Spyce and perhaps webpy/Spyce over the holidays. Interesting times.

A common issue, across languages and domains, that deserves much more attention than the Lisp vs trivia, the Django vs trivia, etc that the reddit controversy has generated.  Good API design is not accidental, or easy, a fact too many code wizards ignore.

I dont know which site is doing better financially (does either one even have a biz model? What might it be, one wonders), but digg seems more polished, has a more pleasent UI, seems more featureful, and more popular.
 
Setting aside the Python v. Lisp debate (which is so boring and pointless), Id hate to be in what seems to be reddits position: serious, robust competition and remaking fundamental tech decisions.

Why does everyone take this attitude of creating an entirely new framework? In most other places, people fix bugs in existing software and contribute their skills rather than creating yet another framework. Though I may be biased, web.py looks suspiciously similar to Subway (as does TG). Why didnt you opt to contribute to Subway rather than, again, divide the Python web framework communitys limited resources? When I started Subway, Django or TG hadnt come out yet, and there wasnt a non-Zope standard full-stack framework. I wanted to reuse as many existing components as possible to minimize this sort of thing. Dont you think it would be a bit more productive if you had contributed to one of the many existing frameworks rather than invent yet another half-baked SQLObject/Cheetah framework? They all suck isnt a good answer; the only way to create a non-sucky framework is to work together.

What lisp needs the most is a lot of new hackers willing to play with it. Lisp was abandoned for a very long time. Those other languages mentioned in the discussion were not. Right now Im expecting very good things from projects like CFFI, wxCL and others.
 
Its a good thing they rewrote reddit. I usually implement and refactor an algorithm in lisp, because it has lots of features to help that, and then, I just implement the whole thing in other language just because it fits better with the task at hand, other languages have more libraries and that helps a lot.
 
I just like lisp more than Python and Ruby but this is just a personal preference. We need better lisp implementations, because almost nobody used lisp in a long time some problems went unnoticed but this is starting to change.
 
A good thing that Lisp makes very well is helping us identify the features and abstractions of other languages. A good lisp hacker has to be a good programmer in several languages, not just lisp.

The Lisp guys rewriting Reddit are missing the point.  Who here doubted that some Lisp pros could build Reddit?  Building something that already exists is easy:  the idea and prototype have already been made for you.
 
The point is that some relative Lisp newbies tried to build their project in Lisp and found it not worth it.  Every time someone builds something in a language that isnt Lisp is there going to be a big freakout followed by some Lisp pros duping something thats already been done?  What a waste of time!  The Lisp guys rewriting Reddit should be looking at where the finger is pointing instead of the finger itself.

I (respectfully) disagree, Egg Shen. The biggest waste of time I see is the soap opera of emotional pundits. (If any of my comments have been emotional, then I surely admit Im part of the problem.)
 
Take for example the fellow whos competing with Reddit. I think despite the non-technical criticism which is all too common on blogs, whose only real effect is to increase Lisps bad-boy notoriety, some tech-minded developers are honestly waiting to see Marcs progress and code. In fact, Ive watched one or two very interesting presentations he gave on web frameworks. 1

Peter Hunt: When I started Subway, Django or TG hadnt come out yet, and there wasnt a non-Zope standard full-stack framework.
 
This either shows how little research the average megaframework inventor does, or how unwilling they are to admit that other comparable solutions already existed. Ever heard of Webware, Peter?

Weve been fixing bugs, smoothing corners and adding features to twisted nevow over the last three years and its doing agreat job on a variety of sites handling traffix in excess of 50 pages per second. Its also delivering multi-lingual content for the country of Oman and powering Athena powered websites for the health care industry (check your greek history for the her relation with Ajax). However, instead of starting with the flashy bits, the time has been spent getting the foundations right first so dont expect a ruby on rails replacement just yet (in fact probably never, which is a good thing).

Dont know if youve noticed, but Webware has stagnated for the past few years and doesnt support WSGI. Its also a bit too J2EE-ish for many Python people. Have you ever even used Webware? Youll see that the current types of Rails-inspired frameworks are totally different.

I think stagnation in terms of webware means stability rather then a lack of use or interest. Really all the new frameworks like TG, subway, django dont really offer much more in terms of web framework then webware. They are just slightly different. The likes of FormKit (or FFK) are only just now being implemented in TG and from reading the forums, it seem as if these groups think the ideas are new and unique. Dont get me wrong, there are improvements, but to think that all this is somehow new and exciting is ego fluff. Same goes for web.py it may seem simple now, but thats only because it was written to do something simple. Just wait until it gets used, then the bloat and complexity will come. Its just the nature of things.

This problem : no framework is exactly right leading to replication of effort is a sign that no language really fits well with the web.
 
Whats needed is a new, higher level language for descriping web-apps with web-concepts, sessions, continuations, whatever, as built in primitives.

Incorrect. There was Webware, SkunkWeb, and possibly one or two others.

Straight away, you contradict yourself: how many years has Subway been around?

Yes, but Webware was a full-stack framework: URL dispatching, presentation, persistence, the rest. It might not have been polished or even 1.0, and it might have been Java-like, but Rails and friends dont suddenly define full-stack. Moreover, there are Webware derivatives that do support WSGI.

OK - I have read Aarons post and most of the commentary about reddit, django, why the switch, etc  Most because it got redunant towards the end  I have one question
 
The religious arguement seems to have started over a new site (Reddit) that is a weak copy of Digg.  Am I missing something here?  Arent we talking about the best way to do something that has been very well done in the first place?

I think the main point of the comp.lang.lisp newsgroup posters was that they not only created two different renditions of reddit within 24 hours, but that one rendition  was up and running within 3 hours of initial code and was in production in seven hours!
 
So, hmmmm, 7 hours for Common Lisp and 7 days for Python - which is most productive/stable?
 
In the end, the Reddit people were Pythonistas who  had merely dabbled in Common Lisp. Their most serious problems arose from their insistence upon conflicting choices of development platform versus implementation platforms. Pardon me if I do not sympathize with stupidity.

That could hardly have been the point since at the time I wrote this theyd written nothing. if it was their point, it was a stupid one, since reddit did just as much as they did (in fact, probably more) in the same amount of time. The reason it took a week is because the reddit team built a production service, with reliability and scalability, and numerous little features. Some of the lisp clones didnt even save things to disk. I fail to see how something that loses all your users data when the computer is rebooted counts as more stable.
 
Furthermore, reddits author is not a pythonista but a long-time dedicated lisp fan who wrote a thesis with the language.
 
And how is it stupidity to want to be able to develop on your laptop? Its convenient to be able to work from planes, for example. (In fact, Im posting this from one.)

web.py is very very very cool! Better then Zope ;) or django. Yes, its right: Zope/django - API/models/accent mistakes = web.py!
 
Some reflection:
1. way less code - is good!
2. template independent - is good! (not only chetaah, may be EMPY as less (1 file!)
3. independent moduls - is good! (I can change one module by other or remove it from my distribution)
 
Aaron, big thanks for web.py! :) (little site for 1 day)

im using web.py with kid (or vice versa?) and this works just fine. switching from cheetah to kid was a total no-brainer, and im both a python n00b and a web.py n00b. this is a testament to how little web.py gets in your way. however, i dont object to cheetah being the default templating engine and being nicely wrapped in web.py; IMHO its slightly inferior to kid, but its not that bad either.
 
im just not sure yet if the frustration of being given so little to work with from web.py weighs less than the frustration of being burdened with the superfluous fluff of full-blown frameworks. i hope that there will soon be a lib that lets you do anything you need, in a simple, straightforward way, with Less Code(tm), but still allows you to do it your way, without hidden magic, auto-generated code, etc. and if i have to write that lib myself

Title: Trials of Testing
 
Since many readers complained about the previous piece we have pulled it and provided this replacement. The things we do for you people!
 
It takes little courage to denounce men who believe they can harness the power of their minds to fly and use a space of universal consciousness to create world peace. And, in the long run, it is of little consequence. No one can recall the obscure psuedoscientific claims of yesteryear.
 
But take the idea that underneath the skull lie a series of organs for human traits like acquisitiveness and amorousness which bulge and change the shape of the head with dominance. The idea seems equally preposterous but it held real sway in its era  the Massachusetts Medical Association and the president of Harvard threw their weight behind it (Paul, 7) and phrenology continues to be remembered today.
 
Such absurd ideas are not remnants of a bygone past  just replace organs with genes and youll have the new science of evolutionary psychology (formerly sociobiology), an absurdity which Harvard Universitys own president has thrown the institutions weight behind. And yet one rarely sees pro-science skeptics challenging its claims. Indeed, scientific magazines write them up with only minor questioning, saving their ire for those who dare criticize the ideas.
 
But at least such fields have critics (and I count myself among them). There are related claims, however, that exercise much more power over our lives and (perhaps as a result) are far less challenged. One of their creators explained that they would promote personal development, manage conflict, and increase human understanding worldwide. (Paul, 121) But instead of Vedic science, she was talking about here creation: the Myers-Briggs personality test.
 
I have written before about the failures of experiments to provide evidence in favor of our concepts of personality or intelligence and how despite this many continue to believe in them. One can discuss how even studies by proponents find that IQ lacks validity and that 47% of people have a different Myers-Briggs personality type on a second administration of a test. But this somehow seems not to convince. So let us try another tack: let us look at how these tests are made.
 
The history of the IQ test  along with a number of other supposed ways of measuring intelligence  is detailed in Stephen Jay Goulds classic The Mismeasure of Man. It was originally created by Alfred Binet to find children in French schools who might need special tutoring. Binet thought that by locating and helping these students, one could make sure that everyone learned all the material. Binet composed the test by throwing together whatever questions came to mind: things about shapes and numbers and words. He just wanted to see if some kids were having trouble, he made no attempt to make sure the result was a balanced measure of intelligence.
 
Lewis Terman, a professor at Stanford University, imported the Binet test to America, added some more random things and mixed it all up a little, and called the result the Stanford-Binet intelligence test (a name which is still used today).1 One of the tests first applications was American Psychological Association president Robert Yerkess attempt to classify the people recruited for the Army. Among the questions:
 
Crisco is a: patent medicine, disinfectant, toothpaste, food product
  The number of a Kaffirs legs is: 2, 4, 6, 8
  Christy Mathewson is famous as a: writer, artist, baseball player, comedian
 
Recent immigrants, whose command of English might be understandably weak, were allowed to take a pictorial version: drawing a rivet in a pocket knife, a filament in a light bulb, a horn on a phonograph, a net on a tennis court, and a ball in a bowlers hand (marked wrong, Yerkes explained, if an examinee drew the ball in the alley, for you can tell from the bowlers posture that he has not yet released the ball). (Gould, 230)
 
Terman, meanwhile, conducted a longitudinal study of the people his IQ test marked as gifted. Joel Shurkin, based on exclusive access to the records, documented the full story in his book Termans Kids. Among the studys participants was a man named Jess Oppenheimer. Gave the impression of being very pushy and forward although he did not show these characteristics during the interview, wrote one of Termans assistants. I could detect no signs of a sense of a humor. (Shurkin, 54) Oppenheimer went on to create and write the shows I Love Lucy and Get Smart.
 
The story of personality tests is little better. In her book The Cult of Personality (recently republished as The Cult of Personality Testing), Annie Murphy Paul (a former senior editor for mass bi-monthly Psychology Today) describes the history of all the major personality tests. Take the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), which was created in a similar way to the IQ test.
 
The test was created by psychologist Starke Hathaway and neuropsychiatrist J. Charnley McKinley by simply coming up with a bunch of true-or-false statements that they thought might indicate whether the respondent had a mental illness. Among them:
 
I have never had any black, tarry-looking bowel movements.
  I have had no difficulty starting or holding my urine.
  I have never indulged in any unusual sexual practices.
  There is something wrong with my sex organs.
  I believe there is a Devil and a Hell in the afterlife.
  Everything is turning out as the Bible said it would.
  I think I would like to belong to a motorcycle club.
  Often I feel as if there were a tight band around my head.
  I loved my father.
  I like to flirt.
  I believe my sins are unpardonable.
  I have a good appetite.
  I think Lincoln was greater than Washington.
  Women should not be allowed to drink in cocktail bars.
  A large number of people are guilty of bad sexual conduct.
  If the money were right, I would like to work for a circus or carnival. (Paul, 53)
 
The resulting test was administered to the patients at the University of Minnesota mental hospital as well as the (presumably sane) staff there (all white, Protestant, Minnesotans who came to be known as the Minnesota Normals). Statistical analysis was then done to determine which questions more accurately predicted whether the user had a mental illness and more specifically, what kind.2
 
This was quickly generalized: people who scored above-average on the scales for Hysteria or  Depression (but not high enough to actually have a mental illness) could be said to have hysterical or depressive personalities, even though there was absolutely no evidence to support this leap (not that it was on particularly sturdy ground to begin with).
 
The resulting test was used to analyze people in business, the army, court, high school, and at the doctors. It was used to screen job applicants, offer vocational advice, settle custody disputes, and determine legal status. (Paul, 58f) And while the test engendered some backlash, it continues to be used frequently today, often as the a requirement for getting or keeping a job. Paul notes the MMPI (in an updated version) is employed by 86% of clinical psychologists and administered, by one estimate, to 15 million Americans each year. (63) For example, it is used by 60% of police departments to evaluate prospective officers. Meanwhile, studies show that such tests can reject as high as 60% of healthy applicants.
 
This is but one example  and one chapter in Pauls book  but all the others all have similar stories. An absurd test, concocted through absurd means, completely untested, ends up becoming a powerful societal force. All the more reason for us to speak out about them.
 
Incidentally, although Terman did not put his name on the test, his family continues to have a presence at Stanford. His son Frederick Emmons Terman was a professor of engineering (and later provost); the Terman Engineering Center, which was across the street from my dorm, is named in his honor. And down the hall from me in my dorm lived his daughter, who, in full disclosure, I ate meals with a couple times.
 
Not that this methodology is necessarily flawed, although it leads to some interesting conclusions. Paul writes that in one experiment, the question that yielded some of the most useful information about whether someone had a fascist personality was: Obedience and respect for authority are the most important virtues children should learn. (Paul, 147)

Aaron:
 
Your post is appreciated as I wasnt aware of the background of some of these tests. Obviously, an un-scientific test that is given the weight and backing of science is a flawed way to approach psychological testing (or any other kind of scientific testing). That is, I believe, self-evident.
 
In regards to throwing the baby out with the bathwater; however, there are ways to approach psychological typing that can be extremely useful in a day-t0o-day way. My wife is a therapist and her command of the distinctions of the Meyers-Brigg system makes it quite useful for her in working with her clients (dont ask me, I dont quite get the whole thing myself). In our company, we both use and provide for our clients a system called Insights based on Jungs work in psychology types. It can be very useful as a way to understand ones preferences. It is; however, not useful as something to pidgeon-hole people but truly as something useful to understand someone elses preferences in order to facilitate better communication and interactions.

Im not sure what it means to be a worthy area of study. Surely everyone is justified in studying things that interest them. But Ive seen no evidence that such a thing as personality exists, let alone that genes determine it in any meaningful sense. If you have some, do let me know.

Thats not really true. The MMPI isnt used at all today. The new version (MMPI-2) has a different normative sample and some deleted/added items. The MMPI-2 is used in relatively limited personnel selection, such as you mentioned, with police officers. It is illegal to use measures of mental health in traditional personnel selection. Normal personality as a selection device, such as the NEO-FFI, is legal and often results in less adverse impact against minorities than cogntive tests.
 
As for the reliability of the MBTI, it depends on how it is scored and how skilled the person administering it is. Its typically favored more as a developmental tool.

Title: Founders Unite for Startup School
 
[The following article was originally intended for Wired News, but was rejected for not being about any of its advertisers.]
 
Experts agree that it smells like a new startup age is beginning to boom. This time, however, its being led by geeks themselves instead of business guys. At the center of this democratizing force is the new funding firm Y Combinator, led by Internet entrepreneur and essayist Paul Graham.
 
Y Combinator burst onto the scene by offering small grants to promising graduates (average age: 23) to pursue their ambitions in startup form over the summer. And this past weekend, the people behind Y Combinator, in association with the Harvard Computer Society, took their show to the masses, inviting 500 of the most promising startup founders to Harvard University for an intense one-day lecture series on all aspects of starting a company.
 
The weekend was kicked off with a smaller reception at Y Combinators offices the night before. The room pulsed with networking between the various would-be founders, as well as some interesting meeting with some of the guests of honor.
 
Last night was the first time I met my lawyer, said Steve Huffman, Lord Ruler and Supreme Leader* of Reddit, one of the companies Y Combinator has funded. The first thing I said was Am I getting charged for this? No, she told me. There are rules preventing us from charging for parties.
 
Meanwhile, clusters of people formed around the nights VIPs, including blogger Joel Spolsky, scientist Stephen Wolfram, and, of course, the Reddit developers themselves, who found themselves deluged by excited fans.
 
The startup school itself was a similarly star-studded event, with Apple Computer co-founder Steve Wozniak telling the story of how his company got started. Michael Mandel, chief economist for BusinessWeek touted the virtues of Americas entrepreneurial culture to the assembled crowd. People starting companies and risking failure are what makes America so great. The people in this room are doing Gods work, he said to applause.
 
Senior officials from Google and Yahoo both espoused the virtues of their respective companies. Lawyers from top-tier law firms provided advice on protecting a companys intellectual property and navigating some of the complex legal waters of the modern business world. Founders Langley Steinert, Marc Hedlund, and Olin Shivers tried to share some of their assembled experience.
 
Because space was limited, people who wanted to attend simply needed to fill out a simple questionnaire about their background, but the event was entirely free of charge. It might seem unusual for a company interested in helping hackers start companies to try to give some of that value away but Paul Graham had an explanation.  Theres a concept in venture capital known as deal flow, he said in an interview. The deal flow is all the interesting startups to fund flowing by. And venture capitalists just try to grab the best ones for themselves. Well, we think the real solution to this is to increase the total deal flow for everyone.
 
Paul Graham himself gave a very well-received talk on how to come up with ideas for startups. The thing that trips people up, he suggested, was mistakenly thinking that a good startup idea needed to be a million-dollar idea. Instead, he proposed prospective founders simply look around for things that are broken with the world and try to fix them.
 
Video of the talks will be available on the startup school website shortly.

Bonus paragraph on Mike Mandel:
 
Mandel also attributed Americas success to the fact that Americans are working longer hours than ever while real wages have stagnated or declined. However, he argued (reiterating a point in a recent article), this was only a temporary phenomenon because tools like weblogs would become a corporate digital spine, lessening bureaucratic time burdens and letting us all be more productive. I think thats as good a bet as the New Economy was, he told a weblog who doubted this. The author of the weblog was unable to discern if he was being ironic, noting Mandel was one of the prime ideologists of The New Economy, claiming the Internet would lead to radical democracy.

Zack Lipton: no, sir. No need to actually fix anything. The strategy for success is extremely simple:
 
Get lots of naked girls to sell your stuff. If youre a girl, take off all your own clothes as well.
 
According to my research (which I did using the just look at my navel while in my bathroom and meditate constantly until I think I achieve enlightenment methodology, and which Im going to sell to everyone by hiring lots of naked girls, assuming I can get my hands on them), the use of nude girls have been found to be 99.9% effective in the marketing of sports cars, crappy music albums, crappy movies, etc. none of which are meant to solve any kind of urgent problem.
 
Move over New Economy, here comes the Nude Economy.

Since I know you are concerned with maintaining the highest degree of journalistic integrity, youll be interested in learning that we at reddit have no C-level titles.  Your assertion that Steve is CEO of Reddit is slightly misleading, when in fact, he prefers the title of Dear Leader around the office.

Title: The New McCarthy: Bill OReilly
 

 
I was reading an old transcript of a piece about Joe McCarthys anti-communist witchunt hearings and I was surprised to find that some of his comments sounded awfully familiar. I did a little googling, and I think I figured out why:
 
MCCARTHY: A few days ago I read that President Eisenhower expressed the hope that by election time in 1954 the subject of Communism would be a dead and forgotten issue. The raw, harsh unpleasant fact is that Communism is an issue and will be an issue in 1954.
 
TONY SNOW (sitting in for OReilly): This morning, the president pounced on a quote in Sundays New York Times Magazine where Senator Kerry called terrorists a nuisance. (October 10, 2004)
 
MCCARTHY: You know the [American] Civil Liberties Union has been listed as a front for, and doing the work of, the Communist Party?
 
OREILLY: [T]here is no question the ACLU and the judges who side with them are terror allies. (July 25, 2005)
 
MCCARTHY: Now, you wrote a book in 1932. Im going to ask you again: at the time you wrote this book, did you feel that professors should be given the right to teach sophomores that marriage  and I quote  should be cast out of our civilization as antiquated and stupid religious phenomena? Was that your feeling at that time?
 
OREILLY: You can understand how people like me and maybe a lot of people watching think you are a loony lefty when your book, Fanatics & Fools [] is endorsed by the following: Molly Ivins; Bill Maher, Bill Moyers; and Larry David. Why dont you get Che Guevara on that, oh, hes dead. How about Fidel Castro? Come on, they are the far left fringe. Thats who youre hanging with  (April 20, 2004)
 
MCCARTHY: If a stupid, arrogant or witless man in a position of power appears before our Committee and is found aiding the Communist Party, he will be exposed. The fact that he might be a General places him in no special class as far as I am concerned.
 
OREILLY: The only thing we can do is hold people who raise and give money to the ACLU accountable. In the weeks to come, The Factor will tell you who these people and organizations are, so you can decide whether or not you want to do business with them. (August 5, 2005)
 
MCCARTHY: When the shouting and the tumult dies, the American people and the President will realize that this unprecedented mud slinging against the Committee by the extreme left wing elements of press and radio was caused solely because another Fifth Amendment Communist was finally dug out of the dark recesses and exposed to the public view.
 
OREILLY: Enter Hillary Clinton, who wants to sit in the White House. In her Newsweek column this week, liberal Anna Quindlen gushes over Mrs. Clinton, describing her as a moderate.  Thats what I mean about the left-wing media. To them, social issues like unfettered abortion, pro-gay instruction in public schools  [are] tak[en] for granted. (May 10, 2005)

In 1944, German troops stood American POWs in a field and machine-gunned them. In 1946 the perpetrators were caught, put on trial, and mostly sentenced to death (though no executions were ever carried out). In 1949, Sen. Joe McCarthy started pimping the line that the SS killers were innocent, it was a sham trial, they were tortured into confessing, and so on.
 
Last week Bill OReilly, in what can be most charitably described as a colossal brain-fart, claimed that the massacre was in fact committed by the U.S. Army, 82nd Airborne Division.
 
Since OReilly has written more sensibly about the Malmedy massacre elsewhere, I suspect that he simply forgot the details of the event and in his fervor just assumed that the U.S. Army was responsible for this war crime. His point was that since the U.S. military committed war crimes over and over in the past, its no big deal now. What would be interesting is to see Noam Chomsky debate Bill OReilly, with the topic: Resolved: that the U.S. military constantly commits war crimes. We might get them to agree! At which point, one by one, the stars would go out.

Your point is.?
 
In what way do the paranoid rantings of a blowhard right wing tv commentator compare to the threat represented by a US senator with subpoena power?
 
As for Chomsky, his paranoid rantings are no less offensive than OReillys except that they are more interesting due to the magnitude of the intellectual resources he brings to the discussion. I wish he had stuck to generative grammar.

You useful idiots have such cute little McCarthy anecdotes, plucked directly from the dumpsters of COMMUNIST disinfo, distorted disinfo that so effectively marginalized him.  If you took the time to research what McCarthy actually said, instead of relying on the brainwashing soundbites so carefully provided for your easy consumption, you would discover that most of what he  claimed was actually true.  Thats OK cause the chains being prepared for you will be custom fitted, so that youll hardly notice them at all.

Anyone who thinks McCarthy was an anti-communist HAS fallen for the communist disinformation. Trotskys red army was financed by J.P. Morgan. General Electric built the Soviet power grid from 1921-23. Ford Motor company technology established the Kama River truck plant that fabricated much of the hardware used against U.S. troops in Korea and Vietnam.
 
NONE of these organizations or the elites that ran them were ever fingered by McCarthy. His job was to convey a sense of fear and mistrust among the rank and file that was conducive as an excuse to expand government power over the people. The real purveyors of communism, the Fabian Socialists of the Council of Foreign Relations, they now practically OWN the government, media and industry in this country.
 
THAT is the legacy of Joe McCarthy. He distracted the people with a freakish sideshow while the real enemies crept in the back door and took over. He performed his job admirably for his collectivist, elitist masters.

OReilly is another in a long line of loud-mouthed, Republican hypocrites.  Ranting about honor and all that BS, meanwhile getting drunk at night and calling up a woman to compliment her on her boobs and saying he wants to rub a falafel sponge on her in the shower.  And he was married with kids at the time.  Just goes to show that these Christian, holier-than-thou, more-honorable-than-thou shills are just wolves in sheeps clothing, and Christianity/Republicanism makes the pefect sheeps clothing, so no wonder it attracts so many rabid wolves.

Heres the crux of the thing:  McCarthy was partly right, I think.  His METHODS were the problem.  True, Bill OReilly has no power of supena, but he holds a much higher chair in the ever-problematic Court of Public Opinion  Which is much harder to sway out of its concrete boots.
 
These people, OReilly, McCarthy are what I call Fixers.  People who think they are pulling the strings behind the scenes to Fix things to be the way they want them.  They are partly right.  They have power swinging around to the point of being dangerous.  But, these fixers dont realize the backswell that happens to gather behind them.  Eventually, a levee breaks (with apologies to Louisiana) or an Edward R. Murrow comes along.. we just need it to happen now!

I dont think the McCarthy/OReilly comparison is a very accurate one.
 
All OReilly is, is a talking head entertainer in the guise of serious political commentator.
 
Time, events, and recent revelations (Venona Intercepts, released Russian documents) show that McCarthy was basically right about Moscow-loyal communists infiltrating the centers of power in this country. So he outted some Hollywood liberal commies, whose loyalty was not to this country, thereby ending their careers. Nothing wrong with that IMO.

Title: David Lynch and Vedic Science
 
I was recently offered a free ticket to see David Lynch give a talk at Emerson College. The talk was titled Consciousness, Creativity, and the Brain. I didnt know why a movie director would have any particular insights on these subjects but I decided that at the least it would be amusing.
 
The talk was held in a huge and beautiful theater in downtown Boston, ornate with two large balconies and, from where I was sitting at least, largely full. We were all handed free DVDs on the way in as well as more information forms with beautiful typography. The form were headed The David Lynch Educational Foundation For Consciousness-Raising Education And World Peace. (The And World Peace seems like it should be a joke.) The dean of the college introduced the event by droning on about how great Emerson College was. I tuned out but the people I went with told me he gave the standard distancing-himself-from-the-event speech, something about how they provided a range of voices to encourage the students (profound voice:) to quest, and to question.
 
Then the president of the David Lynch Foundation came up and introduced David Lynch, who apparently didnt have a talk prepared and just took some questions from the audience. I suspect some of the questions were plants, because they sounded so suspiciously knowledgeable about meditation, but maybe all the local meditators were attracted to the event.
 
In photographs, Lynch looks like an old British dude who would have a deep and thoughtful voice. Instead, his voice is high and squeaky and sort of gimmicky-sounding, which also made it hard to take him seriously. He finished up and the Foundation president came back to introduce Dr. John Haeglin, who he presented as one of the leading physicists of our day. And where does this great mind work? The Maharishi University of Management, although the announcer cleverly pronounced this so it sounded like Murshy University, which is more plausible as an actual school. The Maharishi University of Management (MUM), however, is a phony organization set up the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who claims that he can fly. (The Maharishi, you may recall, also seduced The Beatles. Their later disappointment was the source of the song Sexy Sadie, which was originally titled Maharishi.)
 
Haeglin is the Maharishis main man in the US, running for president on the Maharishis political party (the Natural Law Party), which almost received federal funds from Perots Reform Party, although it narrowly lost to Pat Buchanan. (I had my Sidekick with me, so I looked all this up on the Web while I was listening.) Haeglin had a tricky job ahead of him. He had to explain to the audience that practicing the Maharishis Transcendental Meditation (TM) would send out a magical field that would make everybody nearby happy and peaceful. But he also had to do so in such a way that this audience of college kids, didnt just break out laughing. The answer: science.
 
Haeglin gave some reasonably-accurate descriptions of recent innovations in Physics, noting that reductionism had caused us to realize that the superficial diversity asked an underlying uniformity of, he claimed, vibrating strings (string theory) that connect all of us together. Now Haeglin thinks that TM will cause happy feelings to be transmitted through the strings into nearby people. But even this seems too absurd, so he changes tacks and tries to explain it in a common sense way. If everybody is fearful and scared, he says, you can sort of feel it in the air and you start to be scared. But if everyone is happy, then its just the opposite. TM works in the same way  it puts happiness in the air. He never directly connected this to his comments about string theory and I didnt really see it until I reflected on it later.
 
Haeglin has done several scientific tests, claiming that a group of meditators can lower the crime rate, although when actual scientists checked some of his numbers, they found he had fabricated the crime rate statistics. And David Lynch explained that the goal of his foundation is to raise $7 billion so they can provide Transcendental Meditation in every school. (The David Lynch Foundations website claims that TM can cure classroom stress, clinical depression, learning disorders, high blood pressure, and academic underachievement  oh, right, and cause world peace.
 
Then he introduced a Dr. Fred Travis, also from MUM, who proceeded to do an EEG of some kids brain right on stage. He showed some diagrams of the brain, insisting it had a CEO which told the rest of it what to do. Normally, he said, the brains pieces all scurry about doing whatever they feel like. But Transcendental Meditation strengthens your CEO so he can get all the pieces of the brain working together, doing whatever the CEO wants them to do. He demonstrated this by showing the boys brainwaves normally: all over the place, doing different things. Then he asked the boy to meditate and zoomed in on two brain waves, which started moving in tandem. What this has to do with anything remains a mystery to me.
 
Then Lynch came out and took some more questions. Nobody called him on this nonsense (I was tempted to, but didnt). But you can  Lynch is going on a 20 city tour of universities to spread this nonsense. The entire event was taped so it could be webcast from his website.

Thats pretty amazing. I wish hed come here so I could get a good laugh, but it looks like his final East Coast stop was at Brown.
 
In my experience this silliness is typical of everyone who gives talks on college campuses. In the style of best-seller-list books they only have one interesting idea  which is of course presented in the books they brought with them to sell and not in their talk. Theyll dance around this idea a bunch and then answer some stupid questions with predictable answers.
 
Or if youre from Scaled Composites youll use your talk to make fun of NASA.

Watching this Lynch event was one of the most delightful experiences I can remember. I think this was because what was being conveyed was both a sense of profound knowledge and great joy, which we rarely see today. It only COMES OFF as corny because thats how we are able to see it at first. Then it hits you that theyre just talking about reality: ostentatious and sometimes funny reality.
 
I think the connection between the science of the TM technique and physics was not made in detail. But to me its obvious. It seems to me the connection is this: our entire beings, flesh and nervous systems are grounded in their infinite origins in the Universe. Its nature is our nature, physically and metaphorically. This Universe is finally being understood scientificaly as it has been mystically throughout history; as a unified field, superficially diverse and fundamentally unified. This physical truth is engaged when the mind is in its natural state. All of the universe is experienced in the consciousness of the individual. Techniques like TM allow the mind to be both awake and in deep rest, allowing the individual a more clear and lucid mind for experience.
 
The UC Irvine crowd was great; sceptical but open. We saw different presentations. I think your response is natural but may be unduely dismissive. I remember great insights from Lynchs responses, and wont forget them for some time.

Id like to provide a contrasting perspective on the presentation that took place at UC Irvine:
 
This event was simulcast at Portland State University where I watched in a darkened auditorium as part of a crowd of about 250 people. Many of the people there assumed that Lynch would be speaking in person and, indeed, much of the advance publicity implied that he would be. Because I was a little skeptical about Lynch making a low profile appearance in Portland (not a typical stop on most speaking tours) I had done a little background research into what might be expected at this event.
 
I should mention that parts of What the Bleep!? were filmed in Portland and the film did extremely well here though it did ignite a small controversy in local media in regards to the validity of the science and philosophy presented in the film (TM vs. Humanism.) It is possible that many of the people in the audience were fully aware of what the presentation would entail.
 
Still, in that darkened theater, watching the Irvine presentation on three very large screens, the overwhelming reaction was one of skepticism and disbelief. This reaction most frequently took the form of uproars of laughter. There was a pretty steady stream of people leaving the auditorium from the very beginning of the event.
 
Plenty of awkward, and in some cases embarrassing, statements were made by Lynch, the other speakers and the Irvine audience members and I did scribble down some of the most bizarre and callous of these comments but, honestly, they are not worth passing along.
 
Basically, the evening was an embarrassment to the human condition. It was an insult to science, spirituality and popular culture. Ive wondered for some time why minor cults dont seem to happen as often in American culture as often as they do in Europe and Asia. Perhaps this group is providing an equation that others can take advantage of: Token Celebrity + Misplaced Optimism + Pseudo-Science = Big Bucks. Then again, they may have borrowed that formula from Scientology.

By the way, if I were you I would be more careful before shooting from the hip in posting statements that ANYONE has fabricated statistics, let alone a respected scientist who has had his methodologies critically peer reviewed and then published in reputable science journals, and has had his data - in this case crime statistics - independently audited and validated by top city officials, you really should learn more what you are talking about.  Not only is it sloppy, it is also uncool and potentially libelous.
 
And just for the record, no one found that any statistics were fabricated for that study or any of the 13 independent studies associating the reduction of violent crime statistics and hospital admissions with large groups of people practicing TM meditation in the immediate geographic region. These findings, while very unusual, have been peer-reviewed and published in reputable science journals over a 10+ year period.

I can tell you from my over thirty years of practicing TM, I have slowed my aging process dramaticaly, and in one particular meditation went to an amazingly blissful place inside myself (I would theorise that was perceiving my own soul, something that is within us all, just rarely contacted consciously).  Personaly I have never liked much of what is put out there as truth at Maharishi International University.  Not to say that there isnt truth in it, I beleive there is alot of truth, but as with all human attempts to organise and teach, some of it sucks.  But, as I realised way back when I began meditating, we sure need to do better as humans on this planet.  This is one of the few ways that you can take your own power into your hands to help bring about the improvements in human intelligence that will be required to bring us into the future without making a total mess of our earth.  Change must come one way or another, by making a wreck out of the earth, or possibly, there does exist a soul within us, a spiritual basis for all of life that we can align more with to attain a more harmonious experience here.  TM is very easy to do, it makes sense to me that it does allow you to tap into the depths of the human soul, it changes a large number of things for the better.  The alternative is going forward like a bunch of ca ca heads along the road to who knows where.  It has been obvious for a long time that nuclear technology will be completely out of the bag soon.  We will need some miracles to keep this from getting very ugly.  It makes sense to me that the miracles will have to come if they do from more people living truly good energy.  If you sit in a group of people doing TM, it is not much of a stretch to see what is created as good energy.  Youd have to be there, its simple

I saw the show at USC.  I thought it was great.  I was in a seat that didnt allow me to ask questions, or I would have.
 
Personally, I like to drink my own morning urine each day, then do TM-its helped me in all sorts of ways.  Lynchs presentation didnt do TM justice.  I thought it was a poor science presentation.  too bad.

Did anyone hear about the murder at Maharishi University of Managment. How does this happen in the presence of enlightenment? The only thing TM does is allows the Movement to control your mind and rob you of your critical thinking ability (and hard earned cash). If you get to know any TMers youll soon realize they worship Maharishi as a God and blindly babble whatever mishmash of New Age jabber is fed to them.
 
The celebs and scientists are used as tools to fool innocent sincere people. They are the worst kind of evil.

I think what they are doing is great, but it seems they are exaggerating a bit. It will be better if they just tell us about the things as they are; as they are written in the Vedas.
 
And also, the murder happened at the school seems an example of their exaggeration. Actually, i also do not understand why it should have happened in a so-called peaceful place. Or was it just an unlucky occasion?

I practice Meditation. I feel more connected to my existence.I feel David lynch is doing revolutionary work. The science is in the being. It cannot be graphed or plotted. Thats why it is revolutionary. Results are important, but its about the students living in a more connected way to themselves.This is also the reason our world is sick. We are not connected to ourselves. Meditation helps connect you to the source of everything. Those who are naysayers are not being genuine. Meditation is primal and real. It makes no difference who turns you on about meditation. Study in this area will only promote an individual mind and a connected spirit. All religions have words for meditation(prayer)It is an old study not to be feared or ignored. Whatever scene is happening around TM makes no difference in regard to personal study.

Title: Serenity: A Review
 
Joss Whedons film Serenity comes out tomorrow, the first new episode of his series Firefly in years. Go see it; you wont be disappointed. Its almost certainly Josss best work yet  mixing storyline tricks with biting humor with amazing battles and beautiful surroundings. The cinematography, special effects, and music are all grand. But most importantly, its just really, really fun.
 
I received a press pass as part of the Serenity Blogger Bonanza  they invited bloggers to come see a free preview if they promised to write about it. (My companion thought this seemed rather risky  what if a bunch of opinionated bloggers all give it bad reviews?) They also invited blog readers, but then they claimed that all the screenings were full  I actually received a rejection letter  yet when we went to the theater they were handing free tickets to people walking by on the street and the theater wasnt anywhere near full.
 
Still, it was a good turnout and full of fans. The person to my left said shed already seen the film twice (they previously did previews without finished music and so on for hardcore fans) and planned to go to the real premiere (her fourth screening) dressed as one of the characters. But while the movie fits in perfectly with the story of the TV series (I was surprised; I would have thought the studio would demand changes (actually, I cant recall of the space battles were silent like they were in the TV show (sound cant travel in space, of course))), one need not have seen the TV series to understand or enjoy the film. In fact, while the trailers mention Buffy and Angel, they dont mention Firefly at all.
 
It seemed like everyone there loved the film. As we left, my companion commented, still in awe, I can see why they let the bloggers into see it.

Youre right, its an excellent film (I was at the premiere, and had the satisfaction of updating the Wikipedia page to say it had been officially premiered :) ). Theres been lots of interesting press coverage here in the UK about Serenity. I can only presume because Whedon has such a high profile from the Buffy thing. One can only hope this will mean lots of interesting publicity when it goes on general release.

Title: Serenity
 

 
So Buffy ran its course, Angel got canceled, and Firefly saw its untimely demise. But all is not over for Joss Whedon  Firefly is back, this time in the for of the feature film Serenity. Along with the rest of the diehard Joss Whedon fans, Im on the edge of my seat. By all accounts the film is going to be amazing.
 
In this time of increasing polarization between left and right blogospheres, of endless politically-tinged cultural crticism, its more important to see some pop culture we can unite behind. Thats why its nice to see that the leading blogs of the right and those of the left can get behind this film, with impressive marketing finesse. Heres how the film is described:
 
Joss Whedon, the Oscar  and Emmy  nominated writer/director responsible for the worldwide television phenomena of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, now applies his trademark compassion and wit to a small band of galactic outcasts 500 years in the future in his feature film directorial debut, Serenity. The film centers around Captain Malcolm Reynolds, a hardened veteran (on the losing side) of a galactic civil war, who now ekes out a living pulling off small crimes and transport-for-hire aboard his ship, Serenity. He leads a small, eclectic crew who are the closest thing he has left to family  squabbling, insubordinate and undyingly loyal.
 
I cant tell you how thrilled I am to have managed to nab two tickets to a preview screening here in Boston! The place is practically alive with buzz over this thing  family, friends, random folks at parties are all talking about it.  Ill be sure to tell you all about how great it was after I see it.
 
For more information, including the trailer, check out the Serenity website.

nice job pimping :) I too got tickets (the blogger giveaway) for Monday in Los Angeles. I shall be pimping too.
 
I think the thing about Firefly is it aimed for hard-sci fi, with actual explanations for various matters of science, and enough future to explain for some things i never explained (gravity matching on the colonized outer planets for instance, or terraforming).

Title: The Republican War on Science
 

 
Science, we imagine, is the realm of objective disinterested geniuses reporting back the findings from their expensive equipment, telling us truths about the world. Politics, on the other hand, is seen as the place for sleazy and corrupt jerks who lie to us in everything they do and try to make everything fit their existing worldviews. So is it any surprise that when the two things meet were in for a show?
 
Journalist Chris Mooney has made a name for himself by writing magazine articles that make this intersection, especially under the Bush administration, entertaining. Hes recently released his first book, The Republican War on Science, which tries to combine the various individual stories into a damning case of science politicization. The book tackles a variety of subjects, including:
 
Each one gets a chapter written in the style of a magazine article (indeed, many have been published as magazine articles), opening with an interesting person or event and expanding to show how a group of Bush backers (drawn from major industry and the religious right) have concocted their own psuedoscience in an attempt to spread confusion about the truth, with a particular focus on its effects in Washington, where Mooney is based. Mooney bookends these stories with some more general thoughts about the relations of conservatives and science.
 
The book has been something of a surprise success, recently making it onto the New York Times bestseller list, and Mooney has been busy doing a book tour for it. I went to see him when he spoke just down the street at Porter Square Books and talked to him a bit afterwards as he signed my copy. The audience was interested and engaged. I suspect a lot of it was typical anger at the Bush administration (or the neocon radicals up in Washington and the media as the angry sort who call in to radio shows and so on always seem to put it), but I think this particular issue strikes at the heart of peoples dislike for the administration: the administration refuses to go along with reality, even in its most pure form.
 
The book itself is a respectable and highly readable (I went through it in a days free time) piece of work, although I could not help but feel a little disappointed. In an apparent attempt to gain respectability, Mooney adopts a detached journalistic  almost legalistic  style. While Mooney doesnt pull any punches factually  he will call a lie a lie and refuses to be pulled into the trap of equating conservative science abuses with liberal ones  such a style lacks the verve of Mooneys more strident online writing, such as when he wrote about Michael Crichtons global warming denialist novel State of Fear:
 
Lets face it: Such writing is pure porn for global warming deniers, in much the same way that fictional accounts of UFO abduction skeptics converting into true believers titillate UFO fans. [] By the books end, one can only ask: What planet is Michael Crichton living on? Because this one is clearly getting warmer. (cite)
 
By comparison, Mooneys book-long expos of numerous indidents of Bush administration distortion and dishonesty concludes more like this:
 
these considerations all suggest science politicization has reached a nadir with the Bush administration [] Considered this way, Bush administration abuses and distortions of science come to look more and more like a large-scale political strategy. (241f)
 
And despite Mooneys attempts at moderation and fairness, he hasnt won any favors from the press. Publishers Weekly, in a favorable review, called it very readable, and understandably partisan while the Washington Post attacked it as surprisingly unconvincing, polemic[al], and a kind of conspiracy theory. Since the mainstream was apparently ready to consider the book partisan no matter the style, Mooney probably would have been better off writing a little more strongly.
 
But what about conservative readers? At the book signing, someone asked Mooney if he thought the book would reach them. Mooney doubted that any of the relevant politicians would actually read it. But, you know, maybe someone will say to them, Things have gotten so bad that theres now a book claiming were at war with science! he said. Maybe that will have some effect.

Title: Paul Graham is Wrong
 
I really enjoyed that essay by Paul Graham. Paul Graham is an excellent writer and a very nice fellow. But when he said that thing that made me look bad, I just had to draw the line. For years, Ive been doing something and telling people Im doing it and then all of a sudden Paul Graham comes along and tells me its a bad idea. I think its time to question his assumptions.
 
In his essay, Graham writes:
 
Most people in this situation typically do this thing. But what if they did this other thing instead? This idea typically doesnt occur to them for that reason. But if they did what I suggest, theyd be like a metaphor instead of a simile.
 
Heres where Graham really goes off the rails. What if we dont want to do what he suggests? Graham never considers that possibility. He just assumes that hes right.
 
Once, in an interview, Graham was asked what he thought about this subject:
 
Q: What do you think of people doing that thing?
 
Well, you know, historically people really havent done a lot of this thing and going forwards I see a lot more of this thing happening because the things that have stopped people from doing those things no longer exist. This could really change things.
 
But this is absurd! Just because people can do that thing now doesnt mean theyre going to.
 
For too long, Paul Graham has gotten a free ride by saying things that disagree with peoples prejudices in an informative and entertaining manner. That was fine when all we had to do was link to his article and read it. But this time hes gone too far: hes said something that might actually make me change how I behave. And thats unacceptable.

Sencer explains:
 
Paul Graham has always written the way he has written. That (among real reasoning) includes making assertions and peddling his own views as a kind of fact. The same people that are applauding Graham for brilliant reasoning when he makes assertions that fit their world-view, criticize him for the absurdity of even making assertions, when they dont fit their world-view. Not that they shouldnt, but the inconsistency is just funny in an ironic kind of way. :)
 
In support:
 
Im so glad that someone stood up to him finally. Some of what he says at such as about Amateurs is a bunch of bull crap. [] Paul Graham is not god and some of what he says really ought to not be left unchecked and thank you Aaron for having the guts to stand up to him.
 
In opposition:
 
err what is the point of this? You establishing a reputation and personality off the back of Paul Graham? Man, youre pretty shameless and petty. You think youve stumbled onto a gold landfill by realizing you dont agree with Graham? How many millions of people have read a paul graham essay?

He has also made statements about being an entrepreneur and suggesting that only young people can or should take entrepreneurial risks and that its not such a good idea to do so when youre older and have a mortgage and/or a family. FIrst of all, why does everyone who is older need to by paying a bank a mortgage? Hey Paul,  have you ever read the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad?
 
My father took a calculated risk by starting a business when he was 45 years of age (and yes he had a mortgage and two kids and it wasnt always comfortable in the early startup days but his business has lasted him decades). Paul Graham is not god and some of what he says really ought to not be left unchecked and thank you Aaron for having the guts to stand up to him.

As the learned gmlk states in the comment preceding this one:

By which i think we can paraphrase his true meaning:
 
You blah blah American (blah blah Bad

Im still trying to decide whether this reads better as intentional simple satire or unintentional self-satire.  I guess it depends on whos more intrinsically amusing - the knee-jerk PG haters or the knee-jerk PG lovers.  Is it more ridiculous to assume that PG is wrong when he tells others how to do what they do, or to assume that hes right.

Actually, I didnt recognize the quote in any of Paul Grahams essays as well. I read all of them and they really made me think. Paul was the one who drew my attention to LISP actually and since then I am fancying it.
What most people fail to understand is that Paul Graham is a mere mortal and not God. Just the way he expresses his opinions, firm and selfconcious, does not mean he is not reacting to critics. I actually sent him a mail regarding one of his essays where I expressed a different opinion and he could let that stand, he just expressed what he meant when he wrote his statement and that our two opinions were not even diametral.
So I can only suggest to take Pauls essays as what they are, HIS opinions. Think about it, agree, disagree. If you have done that, I think Paul and everyone has won, because we came out of our lazyness and started a dialoque, either with ourselves of even with him.
So write him your opinions and I am sure he will  think about it, send you an answer and take your opinion into account when writing his next essay.
This is the way science, society and about everything evolves : by dialoque !

Someone on this thread commented about PGs essay on economic inequality.  Now, not to start a flamewar, but I dont see anything objectionable about the essay.  Most of what it says is basically true, and what of the essay that might be contested is just stating stuff that most people dont want to hear.  Its focus is more to discuss startups, of which he does have experience.  I personally wish PG would stop writing editorials, (though he has much better taste in programming languages than a group of java programmers who were trashing him on their blogs because they probably havent considered using anything but java.) Im getting sick of his narsicsstic/strawman writing style.
 
But please dont compare him to ESR.  He is 100x the hacker that guy was, or ever would be.  I just wish hed stop pigeonholing everything with his unbalanced essays (though I will say, he got me interested in Common Lisp about 6 years ago).
 
Anyway, he definitely knows what hes talking about in computer science, but I wish hed stop it with this hackers are this/that mumbo jumbo.

Title: Reflections on Cultural Fragments
 
Six Feet Unders final episode: After the second-to-last episode of Six Feet Under aired, I was having lunch with my partner Simon. I wonder what theyll do for the last episode, I said. Obviously theyll have to kill everyone off, but how? Ooh! Maybe theyll make the house collapse. Then they could have these cool shots of everyone being crushed as everything is shaking and falling down. I thought about that for a second.
 
No, thats not really their style, I concluded. Instead theyll probably have flash-forwards showing how everybody died. And theyll sneak them in as flashes cut with present-day stuff. Theyll probably shoot the episode from the point of view of some new character who will walk around and whenever he meets someone, theyll have a flash-forward and show how that person will die. Oh, and get this: the new guy? Hes played by Alan Ball.
 
Well, I was pretty close.
 
Everyone else seemed to like the final episode of Six Feet Under. I found it merely disappointing. It was just like the boring parts of any other episode, only longer. Where was the heightened drama? The pathos? The raw emotions? Whenever Alan Ball previously did an episode, it was something special, much better than usual. Has the rest of the team gotten so good that when Alan Ball takes over now, he ends up with something worse?
 
I believe it was Jason Kottke who said that this was the first series finale that made him cry and left him missing the characters for days. Someone needs to buy him a copy of My So-Called Life.
 
Michael Penns latest album: Michael Penn is married to Aimee Mann. Their musical styles are practically the same, except for their genders. And this year, they are both releasing concept albums telling stories about characters in the past. So it was disappointing to discover that Michael Penns music is so much worse. The work on his latest album, Mr. Hollywood Jr., 1947, sounds about as immature as the songs on Manns debut, Whatever. Penns first track, Walter Reed, is the only song that approaches Manns modern skill definitely the best.* Fans who want a male Aimee Mann are better off with her old boyfriend, Jon Brion.
 
Manns latest album is The Forgotten Arm and I finally figured out today what in the story that title refers to. Reviewers have apparently criticized the album for not having any stand-out tracks, but that seems like a bizarre criticism because practically every track on the album is a stand-out. I recall the same bizarre crticism being leveled at the Jon Brion version of Fiona Apples Extraordinary Machine, which remains a work of genius even if Fiona doesnt think so.
 
* I was far too harsh on Penn. After listening to the album a couple times more, its a very interesting work and deserves to be judged on its own merits.

My wife and I were very disappointed with the final Six Feet Under. So sappy! Happy endings for everybody  so un-six-feet-under-ish. We laughed through the montage of future deaths at the end; it felt like a weak attempt to sling a little edge onto the previous 70 minutes of Mayberry. Everyone must agree, though, that seeing Brenda nod off was pretty funny; and Rico just falling over; and Keith getting his dramatic end.
 
Oh well, not every ending can be St. Elsewhere.

Heh. Id be the first to agree that Penn is definitely less accessible than Mann, even though they write from much the same sensibility. Hes never quite equalled No Myth, somehow. I do like a number of his other songs, like Bunker Hill, and Walter Reed is an obvious single, but his songs dont differentiate themselves as much as hers do, and yet her albums are usually integrated wholes. Something of a same-yet-different problem, shes mastered it, hes still working at it.

Heres a photo of me listening to a pitch from up-and-comer Ada Norton about the layer architecture of her new Fish-on-Puppies web application framework. Definitely one to watch  Ive recommended that Y Combinator invest immediately.
 
(more photos)
 
I generously gave Ada a 20% discount off my normal consulting fees, in exchange for 10% of the company. I hope that other entrepreneurs will follow my lead in generously giving back to the community.

Does it scale? Who cares! All that matters is that now our consultant can get $$$ and a share in someone elses company and a look at the companys IP, and all this just by giving some fluffy advice, probably along the lines of Great idea! Go! Go! or This sucks 100%. Blow up and redo. And on top of that, our consultant gets to call it a way to give back to the community!
 
This probably means that I should go into consultancy too. But first I need a bottle of Aarons Secret Stuff

Title: Behind the Rant: Maciej Ceglowski
 
As a noted Internet pundit, I have spent years suggesting that the future would be so bright if everyone worked on my pet project. In particular, I have argued that the Internet needs serious, well-written, critical investigations into societal phenomena. Now Maciej Ceglowski has shown just how right I am. Ceglowski, who in addition to being a brilliant ranter can also paint, program, and act as some sort of unspecified nonprofit functionary. In a brilliant and detailed piece entitled A Rocket to Nowhere Ceglowski takes apart the manned space program with an elegance and completeness not seen since Christian Parenti wrote for The Baffler. How did this feat come about? I sat down with Ceglowski over email to discuss it.
 
Aaron Swartz: The Weblog: Youre a ranter (in the best sense of the word) more known for your pieces about technologies and technologists, like your audioblogging manifesto, than for social criticism. What led you to a piece about manned space flight?
 
Maciej Ceglowski: I dont think a rant about space flight qualifies as social criticism.  There are rockets involved, after all.
 
What provoked me in this case was the hype about the Return to Flight, along with a series of NASA statements suggesting that the Shuttle was safer than ever.  And there is something fascinating about the completely reflexive nature of this mission.  Trash collection aside, the only point of the flight is to see whether things that break on the way up can be fixed in time to come down.
 
ASTW: Did you have any previous background in the subject?
 
MC: No.  I wrote a small shuttle rant two years ago after the Columbia investigation, and I was a space geek growing up like everyone else.
 
ASTW: Your article shows a withering level of understanding of the program in all its many facets. What was your process of research?
 
MC: here is an enormous amount of space-related material online, a lot of it highly technical.  Many space geeks are web geeks and take the time to scan strange old articles, transcribe stuff, and create obsessive websites. NASA also puts up a lot of interesting documents.  This makes it particularly easy to find good information on the space program, including far more incisive critiques than the one I cooked up.
 
ASTW: How long did the whole thing take? Did it interfere with your busy schedule of unemployment?
 
MC: I collected links for a month and then pooped out a rant. Most of my limited active time is spent painting, but the oppressive heat provided a good excuse to stay home and read Shuttle links instead.
 
ASTW: In the article you write that, Future archaeologists trying to understand what the Shuttle was for are going to have a mess on their hands. What do you think future archaeologists will think when they search the text of this era for comments about the problems of future archaeologists? Do you think theyll find such results genuinely helpful or more of a rhetorical concern?
 
MC: I think future archaeologists will be digging through 30 meters of ice with a sharpened stick, looking for canned goods.
 
ASTW: Already your article seems rather popular. Do you see yourself doing more such work in the future?
 
MC: Im sure Ill continue emitting sporadic essays, I like to write and I enjoy getting attention.
 
ASTW: What do you see as the larger place for such writing? In an era of generally superficial science reporting, largely uncritical magazines, and endless technical jargon, wouldnt you endorse my hobbyhorse?
 
MC: People need to stop wasting their time surfing the web and get back to work.  That means you too, startup boy - coffee break is over!
 
ASTW: Often while reading someone or about something, you feel like theres something wrong but you cant quite put your finger on it. As one of the Internets most noted ranters, you dont just put your finger on it, you put your finger all the way through it and twirl it around for good measure. By clearly articulating a problem, one would think you might have more effect than people who vaguely complain about it, but does that effect ever reach nonzero?
 
MC: Well, twirling the finger is just good manners.    As for nonzero effect, I dont think the NASA administrator is going to read my weblog and scrap the International Space Station any more than I thought Paul Graham would stop writing online essays after Dabblers and Blowhards.  The point of the exercise is to offer a little mental release to people who get as annoyed as I do, but lack the time or energy to spell out why.
 
ASTW: Have you thought about writing for some more formal publication or submitting your stuff to something like Harpers or The Baffler?
 
MC: Writing popular online essays is like being the prettiest girl in Scotland - satisfying on its own terms, but you cant let it go to your head.
 
If you look at a publication like the New Yorker, theres a dearth of articles written by guys who sit around reading web links in their underwear, and a profusion of articles by people reporting from remote places, or speaking to anonymous sources theyve cultivated over a lifetime of careful journalism, or deploying vast reserves of wit and erudition against a topic theyve studied carefully.  It all just sounds like work.
 
ASTW: Thanks for sitting down with us.
 
MC: Thanks for emailing me this template.

Title: Eat and Code
 
Dear Diary: Sorry I havent written so long. Running a startup is hard! That and finally having people to talk to sort of takes some of the time and desire out of writing. Im thinking maybe instead of a full blow-by-blow account of what happened, Ill write posts about different topics, that will recap the story so far. My first attempt follows. -ASw
 
Life seems so incredibly overworked and overcomplicated that you pare it down to the bare essentials: eat and code. Surely you should be able to handle this without distraction. Unfortunately, its not so easy.
 
Lets take eating.
 
To be honest, Ive always had a problematic relationship with food. I always liked plain things  the year before college I lived mostly off of eating plain, microwaved bagels. At oriental restaurants I would always just order steamed white rice. Wes Felter, noting I would apparently only eat white food joked, referencing a Science Fiction novel, that I would eat light bulbs, but only the white ones. This reached its extremes at a World Wide Web conference where all the food was white, even the plate it was on. Tim Berners-Lee later pulled my mother aside to share his concerns about this diet.
 
Finally, one day at an oriental restaurant by Stanford (years before I went to school there), we had the typical discussion except this time Cory Doctorow spoke up: are you sure youre not a supertaster? he asked. I had heard the They Might Be Giants song but never considered the possibility. I thought about it as the conversation continued and it seemed to make sense to me. [At this point I imagine a crane shot lifting up and up over the conversation at the restaurant. Fade to:] I did some research on the Internet and did the test (which formally consists of putting blue food coloring on your tongue, taking a piece of paper with a three-hole punch, placing it over the tongue and counting the number of taste buds in it) and indeed, I am a supertaster. This hasnt eliminated the discussions about my eating habits, but it does shift the blame.
 
In any event, Im not one for the fine arts of cooking. So its always seemed attractive to me to have a simple food that tastes decent that I can just pull out and eat whenever I want. And, lo, it appeared that I had found it: Cheerios. Cheerios claimed on the box to be healthy, they had little in the way of taste, I could eat them whenever I want, they had big boxes of them at the corner grocery store  everything seemed great. Cheerio boxes piled up in the corner. (Photo to follow.)
 
There were some problems, though. I didnt eat them with water or milk, which meant that a fine Cheerio dust went everywhere. This dust was so fine that it got into invisible cracks in my laptops surface and apparently bonded with the metal and had to be scraped out each time I ate. And then I begun to discover that the Cheerio dust was also into my system, possibly even my lungs and giving me some Cheerio form of silicosis; they made it difficult to breathe deeply. Wouldnt it be ironic if I died of pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis? I asked Simon. (I chose pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis as a spelling word in 6th grade.)
 
At the same time, I was suffering from bouts of acid reflux which continued to grow in frequency and severity. First just some acid. Then, one night walking back from a Noam Chomsky lecture, I began to cough of what felt like my stomach lining. I gave up the Cheerios but it didnt help. Last night I threw up my entire dinner.
 
And then what do I eat instead? We go for regular meals at 12 and 6 but Im only sporadically hungry and the food is getting boring. In Science Fiction stories, we imagine small packets of food that are healthy but taste like whatever we enjoy. Forget that, Id be happy with just packets of food that are healthy. Im sick of having to worry about food.
 
And then theres programming. When Im feeling good, Ill have bouts of just amazing productivity, doing everything that needs to be done in hours. The only problem is that these good days are followed by a week of bad ones, where I feel tired or depressed or scared and cant quite force myself to sit and face the code.
 
I used to think this was just cowardice, that I just needed to sit down and program and Id get the same level of productivity again. But what if this is some serious limit in my brain? What if programming takes so much out of me that it takes days to recharge? Ive never seriously considered this possibility before, but its not just fatalism  it has real implications for how I should structure my days.
 
The last time I was fighting procrastination I was watching a bunch of good television shows. And as part of this, I would read Tim Goodman, the Roger Ebert of television critics. I was struck to learn one day that even Tim Goodman, whose job was to literally sit down and watch TV, could not bring himself to accomplish this task. I mean, I knew all about Structured Procrastination but surely it had its limits. How could someone procrastinate sitting down and watching TV? And yet, here it was before my eyes  my favorite television critic, a hardworking and thoughtful man who had even spent a column answering a question I sent him, even though I lived in Chicago at the time.
 
The lesson I drew from this is that the human mind is such that whatever you do, it will try to avoid it. So you might as well aim high. Now the question is: what do you do with the rest of time?

I find that it takes me some time where I have to think about a problem before I can actually do any programming.  Its funny, because this time looks completely unproductive; Im just surfing the web or whatever.  But then I can write good quantities of code in a small amount of time.

Have you considered that your focus problem and your diet are related? The brain loves its calories remember. The trick for mes to stop as soon as I have to re-read a line, get up, go do  something mindless and physical, make a snack then go back to it. It works for me everytime.

absolutely. its got to be difficult to get 2000 calories a day out of Cheerios. and if youre only getting 1000 or so, you might be on the way to being malnourished. i read somewhere, once, i think, that an adult male subsisting on less than 1500 calories meets the UNs definition of starving. that sounds a bit extreme now that i right it, but no ones going to function well if theyre not putting in enough raw fuel - although im sure its possible for a time, especially while youre young and handsome ; )
 
i dont have any great answers though. you could try those slimming shakes, as a simple and temporary measure for getting calories down you. my kid brother had an eating disorder for a time, i dont know how he figured his way out of that one either.

Two options for the food problem
->Seedless Grapes
->Keebler sesame seed crackers.  Surprisingly addictive.
 
Also, Id argue in favor of explicitly leaving an hour or two to slack each dayI crash and burn whenever I go into a task trying to immerse myself into it completely and forego all other seemingly-expendable essentials in life.

If I recall correctly the brain runs (or runs better) off the diets protien and uses something insane like 1/4 of your total caloric intake. I eat lots of tofu and tuna to help with this  tuna has a pretty strong taste though. I would imagine tofu might be a nice bland food that isnt all carbs. But I know next to nothing about nutrition.
 
For performance one thing I recommend is coffee, but only use coffee as an amplifier if youre already awake. Using coffee when youre tired just makes you alert but tired and you continue to underperform. When Im stuck on a problem any active entertainment (web browsing, tv, newspapers) just prolongs the agony. The only way I know to get unstuck is to go for a run, a walk, or just sit in a chair outside and stare at nothingness. Im extremely visual, however, which could be why I find it next to impossible to get creative thinking in front of a colorful computer screen.
 
(In fact, Im going to change my screen to black and white for a few days.)

I have horrific issues with acid reflux and peptic ulcers.  I really recommend taking a blocker for the acid reflux  acid reflux will screw you up badly with tearing up the bottom of your esophagus, ripping away the lining of your stomach, etc.
 
Secondly, eat whatever you want.  Come over some Friday after Ive made the Kupels run and enjoy some bagels.  :)  I personally dont eat a lot because I also believe Im a supertaster (food dye makes me sick) but also I grew up with a mother who couldnt cook.  So whatever.  I survive a lot of the time on Ritz crackers.

I survive on a diet of Tesco noodles (13c a pack) & wheetabix.
The only meat I get is when Im eating at my mothres or some one elses(which works out to about 2-3 times a week).
I also have the same problems of very going from productive to dead though so maybe not a good idea.

Jeremiah,
 
The brain runs on glucose. In fact, pretty much the whole body runs on glucose, though it does use fat and protein for maintenance. If you are low on calories, the body can produce enough glucose from fat to keep your brain going, but it will not be pleasant. If this happens during long-duration exercise, its called Hitting the wall, and its a very unpleasant experience.
 
Aaron,
 
Supertaster or not, youre going to have to find a way to increase the variety of food that you eat. Vegetables are especially important, both for the nutrients and for the fiber. Your long-term health is in the balance. I have a friend who works to much and eats chicken and brocoli (sp?) every night for dinner, and hes headed for trouble.
 
As far as programming goes, you need to figure out what it takes to get into the flow. Some people need quiet, others need music. The right environment can allow you to flow even if you arent in the right frame of mind.
 
However, there are days that you wont be able to get into it. If Im sick or otherwise down, I cant get there no matter what the environment.

some things to try:
1. better nutrition, especially veggies, and fiber - more what we grew up on as a species
2. aerobic exercise - causes your mitochondria to reproduce, which are what provide your body with glucose. once i got up to 20min a day on my underdesk exercycle (highly recommended), my crashing out episodes decreased dramatically.
3. cut yourself off after a certain time limit, even if youre on a roll - your brain gets tired out and takes a while to recover, hence the crashing out. i learned to stop at 11 hours, even if i was dying to keep working, and my net productivity went way up. youre younger though, and might be able to handle more. but all that constant firing of the same neurons is quite fatiguing on them - theres a lot of machinery turning over in those cells, they need to rest and recover!
4. eat fish and/or essential fatty acids in pills - neurons need these for their fatty coating, which is their electrical insulation. see the aquatic ape theory for one idea of how we evolved into such an (sometimes) intelligent species.
 
best of luck :)

oops, meant to say mitochondria are what supply you with ATP, which is kind of the universal energy shuttle molecule, used to power ion pumps, muscle movement, cargo transport, etc. manufactured by this fascinating protein that spins like a turbine.

Title: iCommons Summit
 
Saturday, June 25  Harvard Law School Campus
 
After wandering around stupidly for about an hour, I see a crowd of people outside the one door I didnt bother trying to open (all the others were locked). Yep, theyre definitely Creative Commons people. Theres Hal Abelson, who seems not to recognize me. And theres Mike who says hi but then gets pulled away. I push inside and get a bottle of water. And theres Larry Lessig! Wow, you look like youve lost a million pounds, Larry says. Is that true? No, I dont think Ive lost a million pounds, I reply.
 
I didnt think that the way I looked would change much. I would always be the little kid in the corner, the guy who definitely stands out. But then I was looking at some old photos of me receiving the ArsDigita prize and I realize I really do look rather different. Then I was ugly, short, fat, awkward, and poorly-dressed. Now Im taller and definitely much thinner (although that seems to change), I wear better-looking clothes, and my face has become rather handsome-looking, especially on the occasions when I shave it. Now when I meet people they dont recognize me  they wait until I introduce myself or  sort of stare at me blankly before they realize who I am  that never used to happen before.
 
Anyway, Im here to check out the iCommons summit. Creative Commons has grown from a couple former students of Larrys to a large international movement (as all the speakers insist on calling it), the most prominent members of which have been flown out to Harvard from around the world thanks to Soross foundation. Charlie Nesson gives the days closing keynote, describing his vision of an indestructible world library.
 
We then retire to Charlie Nessons house, which is the typical sort of cocktail party-type affair. When Im not looking, Lessig gets pushed into Nessons pool. I believe this is the only area where it is appropriate to say this, says one legally-trained guest, but he was asking for it.
 
When I tell him that Im out here to start a company, a descendent of Robert Boyle (of Boyles law) offers to invest. But we dont have anything, I insist. Thats OK, he says, Im sure youll succeed at some point.
 
I spend most of the night talking to Mike Linksvayer, who I end up walking back with, and we end up talking for hours outside the subway stop, long into the night, long after the subway has stopped running, so I buy a box of Cheerios and a bottle of water from a 7-11 and walk the way back to my dorm room, listening to radical radio shows podcast onto my iPod.
 
June 26
 
The phone rings. Its my father. Hi, Im here, he says. Oh. I forgot you were coming. I was just going to see Lessig give a closing keynote. I agree to meet him on the way there and halfway between my dorm and his hotel, there he is, smiling widely. My dad and I have not really spoken in person since almost a year ago, when he used force and trickery to prevent me from going to FOO Camp in a stupid show of power. Hes much nicer now. I think he misses me.
 
As we walk and talk a kid in front of us keeps looking behind at me. At first I think its something Ive said, but he keeps doing it. Finally he stops and says, Hey, youre that weblogger guy, right? Yeah, I say. Aaron something. Yeah, I read your site. Wow, I say. Yeah, Im here for the Linguistics summer school. Maybe Ill see you around some time. Maybe, I say hopefully.
 
I ask if my Dad wants to come with to Lessigs keynote and he agrees.
 
I get to chat a bit with Ben Adida who, having been left with my legacy of using RDF for Creative Commons found himself chair of the RDF-in-HTML task force (quite possibly the worst job in the W3C  I should ask him how he did it sometime) and, now discovering that overnight a major competitor (Microformats, pushed by Technorati) has arisen, is trying to get them to convert. Ive been friends with the Technorati guys and I take their position, telling Ben that its a hopeless endeavor. Ben is a little shocked at this  I was the one who got him on the RDF train after all  and pushes back. And eventually he manages to convince me that it wouldnt require hardly any additional work from the Microformats guys to be RDF/A-compatible.
 
Joi Ito waves from behind Ben.
 
After Lessigs speech, we head off and find dinner.

Title: Simon Arrives
 
Wednesday, June 22
 
I originally made a short-term reservation at Simmons Hall, both because I had to get authorization for a longer-term stay and because I wasnt sure if Id like it. Ive already extended it once, but it expires tomorrow, when my partner arrives (he also needs a room). I email the house manager about staying. He says I should stop by. I go to his office. Hes not there. I try back later, hes talking to someone. And so it goes throughout the day until he leaves. Uh oh.
 
I email him. He gives me a firm appointment in the morning. He can extend my room through the end of the summer. Thanks, I say. Alright then? Actually, I have a friend and I was sort of wondering if he could stay here too Oh, hmm, well, I need to keep a certain number of rooms reserved just in case anything goes wrong, you know. I think were pretty much out. But what about that room next door to me? Nobody seems to be living there. Thats a double, not a single. Oh.
 
Actually, how about this? he says. Ill let you move into that room and you can split it with your friend. How does that sound? This Solomonic compromise is better than sleeping on the street or something, so I agree. He marks me down in his book and gets me the key from the desk. I move all my stuff over to the new room, which is like three times as big as my old room, and nicely laid out too. I return the key to the old room (stupidly, I guess) but I keep the door propped open so we can use it if we need some alone-time. (Which indeed I do until my partner gets us all locked out from it forever the first time he uses it. Afterwards, I switch to using the time machine.)
 
At around 7:30pm there comes a knock at the door  my first here. I open it and theres a strange man I dont recognize with a suitcase. You must be Aaron, he says. Hi, I say. Ive got some good news and some bad news. The good news is I cut our housing costs in half. Wow, howd you do that? he asks. Well, the bad news is its because were sharing one room, I say and open the door onto our double. Oh, he says, a little scared.
 
Despite this humor routine, Im a little scared too. Watching this strange person move into my room is more than a little odd. Ive always been afraid of sharing space with other people. I almost thought of dropping out of college if I had to share a room. At least this is only for the summer. But it still seems odd. What was I thinking when I chose to spend the summer with a random person based on little more than an email and a flicker of name recognition. I didnt even check references, despite knowing one of the references. Why was I so stupid? I make a note to check with that reference (which I never do).
 
Despite all this, it works amazingly well. Simon likes asking questions and I like explaining things. We both enjoy our privacy and end up on roughly similar schedules. Simon is a good, if not great programmer and very open to being convinced hes doing things wrong. In fact, Simon is very open to anything. So open, in fact, that his openness is practically the only frustrating bit about him. I can say the meanest things to his face and hell just laugh and agree.
 
Our first big debate is about planning. Simon wonders why we arent doing more planning. Shouldnt we do use cases and draw up screenshots and make a list of features and pick milestones and build a mockup first? Nah, I say. Lets just build it. This goes against what Simon has been taught. Planning, I say, makes sense when youre solving a predefined problem or working for somebody who is defining the problem for you. But it doesnt make sense when youre hacking. When youre hacking, as Paul Graham likes to note, youre actually figuring out what the problem is, exploring the problem space. Its through writing the code that you figure out what the code should do. You cant plan that. Simon eventually comes to agree, although it takes him a while to get rid of his instincts.
 
Even afterwards, he is still tempted to overbuild things. We needed a permissions system, for example, and Simon build a super-advanced, completely generalized database model for one so complicated that it took up several pages of code. I spent a week trying to fix it up and implement it before finally giving up, saying it was just too complicated for me to wrap my head around. But hes working on it.
 
I, meanwhile, have been struggling with my own demons  mainly procrastination. Programming is an odd task in that it requires so much mental discipline that your mind is often afraid of doing it. Worse still is the fact that it happens at a computer, usually one with an Internet connection, so theres hardly any visible difference between actually doing your work and running off to check your email or read the news. Its incredibly frustrating to snap out of a bit of newsreading and realize you just wasted a couple of hours.
 
To combat this problem, I brought back an old application I wrote: minuteminder. minuteminder unobtrusively pops up in the corner of your screen every five minutes. When you get a second you can click on it and tell it what youre doing and itll log that with the current time and go back and hide. The idea is that the combination of telling the computer youre really surfing the Web and seeing that youve been doing so for the past 20 minutes will jolt you into waking up and heading back to something more productive. Its not a perfect solution, but I think it definitely helps a lot. (A todo outline has been another productivity lifesaver.)
 
Just having another person around is really nice, though.

Title: Faces of Fame
 
In his book Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine American Democracy (a relatively moderate book, despite the title) James Fallows asks (p. 94):
 
Why do [journalists] want to appear [on TV], when so many reporters make fun of the shows?  The most immediate payoff is the simple thrill of being noticed and known. Political-journalistic Washington functions much like a big high school, with cliques of the popular kids, the nerds, the rebels, the left-outs, and so on. To be on Tv is to become very quickly a cool kid. Friends call to say theyve seen you. People recognize you in stores. Whether people agree or disagree with what you said (or whether they even remember), they treat you as realer and bigger than you were before.
 
I learned this weekend that I narrowly missed being on TV (CBS left me on the cutting room floor  I knew wearing that Democracy Now! shirt was pushing it) but I realized that as a prominent online journalist and a new (media) online magazine I should try to capitalize on my existing media power. So Ive posted a photo on the sidebar, so that if any of my many millions of readers happen to notice me on the street or in the shop, they can behave as Fallows suggests:
 
[One] hears from friends and relatives for weeks afterward, I saw you on TV! [Regular commentators] have that extra, sizzling experience of seeing strangers heads flip back, for a second look (Is it really him?) as they walk into restaurants or through airport corridors.
 
Of course, TV does have one big difference:
 
In each case the recognition is almost entirely judgment-free  Print forces the readers attention past your personality to whatever your article is trying to say. TVs effect is mainly to make you bigger than life. For each hundred acquaintances who will say, I saw you on the show, only one will say, I agree [or disagree] with what you said.
 
So, uh, if you happen to see me in a movie theater, or on an airplane, or in the bathroom, or in your dorm room, dont hesitate to shout, HEY! Its Aaron Swartz! I saw you on the weblog. Here, Ill help you out with another picture:
 
Heh, I almost put a picture of Blake Ross there. You would have fallen for that wouldnt you!

Title: Serious Social Science
 
I once attended a psychology lecture in which the speaker argued that Freud was really a brilliant psychologist, but the field had passed him by because of its physics envy. His specific example is perhaps easy to mock, but it has resonance because the problem is a real one. As Paul Graham shows, in general physicists are smarter than social scientists. But (to use a Grahamism), like kids trying to act adult, the social scientists end up emulating the form of these fields but not the content. In other words, instead of getting smarter, they play make-believe.
 
The first thing that comes is the numbers. Real science papers are filled with tables and graphs and regressions on  piles of data, so the social scientists decide to do all that. In economics, they even go so far as to start coming up with equations and proving theorems. Then comes the technical language. Physics papers discuss the gravitational wave perturbations about a brane cosmology embedded in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter bulk so the cult studs decide they should be just as incomprehensible.
 
And then, in the headiness of this newfound power of science, grand claims are made. As J. K. Galbraith writes (_Annals of an Abiding Liberal, p. 4): It is the great desire of nearly all economists to see their subject as a science too. Accordingly, and without much thought, they hold that its matter is also fixed. The business firm, the market, the behavior of the consumer, like the oxygen molecule or the geologists granite, are given.
 
This is not to say that there is anything intrinsically wrong with using math or jargon or making grand claims. But to adopt these habits reflexively is to put the means before the ends. Scientists do not use math because it is complicated but because, for what they are doing, it is effective. Their grand pronouncements become accepted because (sometimes, at least) they are true.
 
Such complaints, among a certain sector, are truisms. But the conclusion typically drawn with them is pure pessimism. Social behavior, they argue, is simply too complex for us to ever make real progress in the field. The topic is studied by idiots and charlatans because the intelligent and honest can immediately see its impossibility. I do not agree with such a view. In fact, I think it is only possible to maintain it thru abject ignorance of what science really knows.
 
The vulgar postmodern critique of science argued that scientists had become our modern priesthood: deified as experts they would make claims about how the world worked, claims with just as much authority as those made by religion in earlier times. And while such comparisons were wrong, they did betray a truth: society has, for largely selfish reasons, inflated the accomplishments of science beyond their actual existence. (See R. C. Lewontins fabulous Biology as Ideology for evidence of this theme, from a respected scientist.)
 
Scientists  even the hardest of scientists  fabricate data, fabricate studies, fall prey to fads, and otherwise get things wrong. But more relevantly, they just dont know that much. We have very little idea of how the body works; the pills we take are made through the bluntest of means. We dont know how to calculate very simple things, like the dispersion of milk in a cup of coffee. The illusion that social science is ineffective can only be sustained by ignorance of such ineffectiveness of hard science. The upside of all this is that there is hope for social science.
 
So what is to be done? For reasons beyond the scope of this article, its unlikely that the existing disciplines can be reformed. Instead what is needed is a culture of serious social science built outside the existing systems of academia. Its work should be primarily outwardly-facing, because thats the important audience. This means clear writing (unlike this article, perhaps) for public consumption. And it means compilations of broad scope, instead of obscure monographs.
 
We can already see the beginnings of such a thing in the work by people like Doug Henwood and Christian Parenti. But there is certainly much more to do, including building structures to do the work in.
 
So thats the other thing Im thinking about.

Title: Our Next Superjumbo
 
The question seems rather less important now, but for a while I was working on a book about politics, especially how the Democrats could win elections. For those out there interested in the question, Rick Perlstein (author of Before the Storm, the highly-praised history of the rise of the Republican right) has written what is pretty much the definitive piece on the subject, now in paperback as The Stock Ticker and the Superjumbo.
 
In short: Perlstein recounts the strong evidence that there is very broad support for the economic platform of the Democrats. Nonvoters, independents, and even Republicans, he notes, support core Democratic principles. They just dont consider themselves Democrats, a party they think of as not standing for anything in particular. This is, of course, because Democrats have been busy chasing after the mirage of swing voters, running further and further to the right, following the ball Republicans are glefully pulling in front of them.
 
He argues that instead, the Democrats must build a strong and long-term political identity, building a new political landscape instead of trying to win on the old one, just as the right-wing Republicans did. Doing so requires a openness to the possibility of losing, at least initially, but in the end it is the only way to win.
 
This artless summary doesnt convey the depth of Perlsteins piece, so if youre interested you can:
 
More thoughts:
 
A final note: Why is all this uninteresting? Because the Democrats arent paid to win elections. Theyre paid to win policy for their corporate donors. Policy that hurts those companies, however popular with the public, simply will not be funded.

Title: Change of Course
 
Here on the Interblog, anyone can write whatever they feel like. Unconstrained by standards and practices, bloggers feel free to write anything thats fair and accurate. For the past ten years, Ive played this sorry game  telling you when I thought my friends books sucked, noting exactly which major media figures offered Schedule III Controlled Substances to teenagers, and speaking frankly about sex. I have finally seen the error of my ways. I plan to become an online magazine.
 
No more will I defend saying something simply because it is the truth. No, from now on, I am adopting the rigorous standards of professional journalists. Ive been convinced that telling people the truth will just hurt them and, frankly, Im a little tired of being mocked and shunned for my honesty, which goes completely unappreciated by you people.
 
So, heres the new regime.
 
The fun starts tomorrow, with a glowing profile of Seth Finkelstein (assuming he approves it, of course). But the first thing I plan to do as a journalist is convene a panel on blogger ethics. Somebody really needs to stop those guys before things get out of hand.
 
I remember seeing a more detailed piece about this that included quotes from major media figures saying that Newsweek did the right thing in this case. I cant seem to find it but if anybody else can, please let me know.

Title: SFP: The Spirit Inside
 
The sun has set leaving the street lights to cast everything in an eerie yellow glow. People from all over the city leave their houses, joining the growing mass that has taken over the streets carless streets. As the group passes darkened empty buildings, old men stand by the side of the road selling colored luminences. An orchestral soundtrack begins to fade up.
 
As the group nears the river, the actual size of the proceedings becomes apparent. The entire riverside and its attached street has become inhabited, people bustling back and forth, setting up shop on various patches of grass, laughing and talking. The orchestral score grows louder, coming from a hulking monolith in the sky.
 
The tune becomes recognizable as the 1812 Overture, reaching its finale. People begin to gasp and point to the other side of the river. Whats going on? asks Simon. Before I can reply light begins to shoot out from the ground up to the sky, exploding in a luminous pattern that leaves shards of fire and smoke lingering in the sky.
 
The music stops.
 
And that was the world-famous Boston Pops playing their signature piece, the 1812 Overture, reports a perky female voice from the loudspeaker. And a little taste of the fireworks that are yet to come, adds the male. In just a moment well be joined by the national audience, so stay tuned to the Boston Pops 4th of July Fireworks Spectacular on CBS!
 
Simon and I find a spot on the grass to sit down as the loudspeaker encourages us to support our corporate and governmental masters. Members of the military are praised for their service. (Even as popular support for the war continues to dwindle, its comforting to see that at least the major television networks will support our babykillers.1) And tonights fireworks display is presented commercial free for the first time through the generosity of Liberty Mutual. Why dont you all show how much you appreciate Liberty Mutual? asks the loudspeaker. The crowd, who I didnt even think was listening, loudly thanks Liberty Mutual.
 
The orchestra prepares us for the show with a medley of American songs, ranging from Yankee Doodle Dandy to YMCA (which we all do the hand motions for, except Simon). Then, for the TV audience, they present an incredibly awful combination of combination of country music, hollowed rhetoric, and false patriotism.
 
But soon enough the fireworks begin and they are indeed spectacular. I cant say Im up on my fireworks but the show is much better-choreographed and impressive than everything Id seen at home. The show lasted nearly half an hour with numerous tunes played, the best being U2s Vertigo, during which large cubes appeared in the sky precisely as they counted off. I also saw smiley faces, supernovae, and an odd sort of color package. Technology!
 
And then, our eardrums battered, the whole thing exploded in a finale that lit up the entire sky. And then we all walked home. Its nice living just a block away from the most spectacular fireworks display in the galaxy.
 
I have no problem with the troops as people  Im sure there as good as anyone  but it wasnt the people that the media was supporting. They were suggesting the job itself was praiseworthy; its not.

Title: Of Washington And Worcester
 
Stanford, California
 
Its June 19. Im still in school, in fact, Im just dashing out of class into the cab waiting outside. The Ford Foundation is paying for a trip to Washington, DC for a meeting about Free Culture. I was initially hesitant about going to the meeting and in fact getting there has been quite a bit of a hassle  here I am at the airport and they claim they dont have my tickets  but I eventually manage to dash onto the plane just in time to get to DC late that night, where I take a shuttle to my hotel.
 
The next day I head out to get lunch and visit my friend Derek Willis who has very kindly offered to give me a tour of his employer, the Washington Post. But as I head out the door I hear a voice call from behind me. Aaron? it asks. I spin around and there on the couch, gleaming like a diamond among the hotels tacky chandeliers and mirrors, sit three young kids  two guys and a girl  wearing stylish-yet-indie clothes and holding skateboards. Hey, says the voice, its Holmes. From Downhill Battle. These are my partners, Nick and Tiffiniy.
 
Cambridge, Massachusetts  Present Day
 
so, are you coming here? i really hope you will, writes Tiffiniy. ok, ill come  let me check the trains, I write back. Downhill Battle is headquartered in nearby Worcester, an hour away on the train. I agree to come by the next day, when I wake up early and pack a book and an umbrella and head west to Worcester.
 
I arrive at the elegant train station and head downstairs and through a ballroom being set up with tables. Outside I look around through the sea of cabs and cars and once again hear a voice call my name. This time its Nick and I dodge across the street to meet him. Hey! he says, embracing me in a hug. Welcome to Worcester.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
The three of them, as it turns out, are just checking in. Having the keys made is taking forever, for some reason. I wait with them and follow them up to their room where they invite me to lunch. We look for places to eat, eventually deciding on a Chinese place down the street. Outside, its raining slightly and none of us have umbrellas. Lets hoof it! shouts Holmes as he takes off running. We all follow in close pursuit: four young kids, running like maniacs in the rain.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
So this is Worcester, Nick says, as we drive past a large abandoned outlet mall on one side and a big gray convention center on the other. Nick drives me over to Tiffiniys place, which she shares with Holmess girlfriend, who let us in. We chat quietly until all of the sudden a noise comes running up the stairs, screaming into the room  Tiffiniy, wide-eyed, coming in and hugging me. Youre here! Youre here! she shouts.
 
Tired, I smile a little weakly.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
We chat about technology and globalization  while they assure me they agree with my politics, they cant help but wonder whether there are benefits to globalization. (My new strategy for discussing globalization, which I havent actually gotten a chance to employ, is to just repeat back whatever people tell me except replace globalization with colonialism.)
 
I then head uptown to the Washington Post. Derek comes down to meet me and sign me in. I notice that on the guestbook the last person to sign someone in was political reporter Dana Milbank. Derek takes me up to the Post newsroom, which looks just like it did in All The Presidents Men (not surprisingly because, Derek comments, the movie was filmed here): a vast sea of gray cubicles with men in suits walking from one place to another, surrounded by reams of paper (and now, of course, computer terminals).
 
Derek, formerly a Congressional reporter, now works as the Posts research database editor, a job which has always struck a political geek like me as a rather sexy position. As we walk to his area of the newsroom, he points out the various other parts (oh, theres Howard Kurtz, he says, that guy is always working!). He introduces me to his co-workers, one of whom tells me the most amazing story about facing down a powerful politician with a pile of data hed found by crunching the numbers in his database. He points to a picture man being frog-marched which sits above his computer. End result was, this guy went to jail, he explains. I cant help myself from smiling widely  it almost gets rid of by cynicism about journalism.
 
Holmes and Nick first met going to high school in Worcester. They soon moved to a Masachusetts math and science magnet school at a local university, where they met Tiffiniy Cheng and others. The group split up to go to college but ever since then theyve slowly been reassembling, living cheaply in Worcester and spending their time fighting the abuse of copyright law.
 
Their organization, Downhill Battle, first appeared on the Internet scene with iTunes iSbogus, a vicious parody of the website for Apples newly-launched iTunes Music Store. At a time when most copyright activists were painstakingly careful to insist they opposed downloading copyrighted music and arguing that the music industry should find a way to make downloading music legal, the websites opposition to one of the first moves in this direction and its full-throated support of file sharing software was nothing less than shocking. Here was someone not just saying what all the kids were thinking, they were actually providing a pretty careful intellectual justification for it. iTunes is just a shiny new facade for the ugly, exploitative system that has managed music for the past 50 years, they wrote.
 
Downhill Battle continued to grow, launching sites like What A Crappy Present.com (humorously warning parents not to buy CDs), Coal for Christmas, and Grey Tuesday. And with the help of another high school friend, programmer Nick Nassar, they begun developing software-based websites like Blog Torrent, designed to make sharing files through BitTorrent as easy as posting to a blog.
 
With little more than a computer in the attic of Nicks parents house, they became a major force in the Internet copyright debate. Cory Doctorow lavished praise on their youthful humor and energy (one of the best, most effective group of copyfighters on the net, fast turning into a MoveOn for the P2P wars, he once called them, my favorite gang of take-no-prisoners copyfighters) and Larry Lessig begun denouncing their extremism (the anti-copyright analog, he argued, of those who think everything should be copyrighted forever) in speeches, positioning himself as a centrist between such extremists.
 
And Downhill Battle continued to grow, launching two more non-profits  the Participatory Politics Foundation, which develops the kind of political technology hacks in a way I once dreamed of doing myself (current projects include a Slashdot-style news site for politics and a website for tracking current congressional legislation), and the Participatory Culture Foundation, which is developing a Internet TV platform which will let anyone start their own television network (delivered over BitTorrent) which can be easily downloaded from a GUI player (Al Gores cable channel and the SEIU, among others, have already signed on to provide content).
 
With the non-profits came actual funding  up to then, the thing was funded by meager merchandise sales, savings, and living cheaply (including living out of their parents houses and buying clothes from the Salvation Army)  and stuff that seemed more like actual work: giving presentations to funders, calling people to invite them to provide content for the TV platform, and so on. No more dashing off web pages attacking major media corporations, now its a long slog toward shipping, all under the guise of professionalism. But its not like theyve started wearing suits or anything
 
(And now they want you to join them! What a sweet job that would be)
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
Tiffiniys friend is also visiting from Vermont this weekend and the Tiffiniy decides to take us all on a little tour of Worcester. Worcester is an odd city. Its an hour away from Boston, yet it looks just like part of the city, not a suburb. But despite looking like a city  blocks and blocks of retail and business and things  the streets are completely empty. And while it contains several colleges, it doesnt feel at all like a college town. And  and maybe this last part is just the Downhill Battle guys  but everything looks like its from the 70s.
 
Tiffiniys apartment, for example, has old draped couches and tables, sinks and stoves  even the new books have retro covers. And the first place Tiffiniy took us was an old shopping mall where they considered buying office space (they needed a place to invite bands, they claim) and the whole thing looks run-down and wooden. Then we head to a hot El Salvadoran restaurant that similarly seems like a throwback. And, of course, all of them dress in retro clothes.
 
At the restaurant, Holmes shows up on his skateboard (also giving me a hug) and getting really into the soccer match playing on the TV. Holmess girlfriend mentions shes getting a tattoo of a Jimmy Corrigan bird on her arm (Holmess sister, I noticed, has the Tristero logo) and Holmes asks me if Ive read Jimmy Corrigan. No, I reply. Oh, you have to, he insists. I say I want to, that Ive read some of Chris Wares other stuff and I really enjoyed it  in fact, I saw him do the most amazing thing with Ira Glass. The whole table groans (with the except of Tiffiniys friend, the other visitor). Ira Glass is a such a jerk! they insist and I get into a long argument about Ira Glass, who I actually really like, but they argue saps all political meaning out of life.
 
The whole point of Ira Glass, Holmes explains, is so that some yuppie sitting in their car can listen to some sappy story about a girl who lost their dog and think that now theyve experienced what it really means to live in America. The show makes no distinction between whatsoever betweem whatever little yuppie bullshit their average listener has to put up with and the real societal problems that face America. Whether theyre talking about silly kid or about gun control, its the same stupid background music, the same smarmy tone.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
American University is hosting the Free Culture conference (theyre the ones with the Ford Foundation funding) and theyre ferrying us all from the hotel to the campus in a series of cabs. Inside an innocuous-looking building at the center of the AU campus, theyve taken out a whole room and done it all up with fancy lighting and real caterers.
 
I try to get around and chat. Colin Mutchler, an artist and and activist who is hosting the discussion, made waves the past year with his Free Culture Tour in which he traveled the country performing on the subject of copyright law and things like Creative Commons. He repeats the presentation for us (it includes, I was later told, a photo of me wearing a CC shirt to represent Creative Commons  I noticed the CC logo but somehow missed the fact that it was me wearing it!) and its amazing. For some reason, I find spoken word incredibly powerful in a real, visceral way.
 
Afterwards, the apparently famed DJ Rekha took over and the Downhill Battle people cleared out some space and started dancing away, eventually drawing others in to join them. I tried to but couldnt shake my self-consciousness.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
Back at Tiffiniys apartment, Holmes is carrying his girlfriend, who is not feeling well, inside. Tiffiniy is hanging out with her visiting friend and so I head with Nick to a place he calls the collective, which sounds interesting enough for me to get in the car without asking further questions. The collectives full name, as it turns out, is Collective  Go-Go and Nick explains that while his friend Jake is on tour with his band, hes staying in Jakes room there.
 
As we drive Worcester becomes increasingly less city-like, its tall blocks fading into strip malls and then disappearing altogether, leaving houses surrounded by trees. Eventually we pull into the drive way of one especially large house and cut the engine. As I step out, the first thing that hits me is the overwhelming silence. The place is beautiful, tucked into luscious green woods.
 
The house tries to be mostly self-sufficient. Water is taken from a nearby reservoir but is heated by hand over a stove powered by firewood which they cut to size themselves (the wood itself comes from a tree removal service). In lieu of bathrooms, they run their own composting process. They have a garden where they grow some food, the rest is bought from local organic farms. Chores (of which there are a lot, Nick says) are shared equally.
 
In fact, were here now to help chop firewood. Nick tries to show me how to chop the wood down to size by hand with a thing that looks like an axe (but blunter, Nick says). As you might expect, Im terrible at it. We eventually pull out the heavy duty wood-cutting machine, in which a hydraulic piston pushes the wood through the axe blade. Even this is something of a challenge, since the wood has a tendency to try to jump up and get stuck and other such things.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
Its surprising how few people I know at this party. People keep having to explain other people to me.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
After chopping wood, Nick shows me around the collective. The garage houses a full silk screening system, which is where they make the Downhill Battle tees. Jake used to be in charge and then Holmess girlfriend, who used to live here, begun helping out. Jake calls on the phone and Nick talks to him for a bit, asking how the tour is going.
 
Inside, Nick introduces me to some of the other collective members and they talk a bit more about Jake. And then, a thought hits me. This isnt Jake Berendes, is it? I say. Nick looks taken aback. You know Jake Berendes? Well, I know of him. How? My friend Leonard Richardson is always making jo Oh, you know Leonard! Wow, thats incredible. The fact that I knew of Jake Berendes quickly became the most interesting thing about me and Nick eagerly told everyone.
 
Indeed, I said, sometimes Leonard needs to assure people that Jake is a real person! Jake doesnt sound like a real person? laughs a collective member with an air that suggests sometimes Jake can be all-too-real. Not the way Leonard tells it, I reply.
 
[Aside: To discuss Jake Berendes would not only be going far beyond my area of knowledge but also to delve into a strange world of magical realism, amateur music, nested in-jokes, Repetitive Electronic Music, and giant squid. Not that thats a bad thing.]
 
Nick takes me up to Jakes room. Jake is the most creative person I know, Nick says. Every day he writes a weblog entry and makes a stuffed animal, he writes numerous songs, draws, makes posters, puts together zines, and on and on. It is truly incredible. Nick gives me a CD to take home.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
The university kicks us out at what seems like an unreasonably early hour and we head outside to wait in the cold for the cabs that are supposed to take us back to our hotel. Nobody shows up for what seems like forever until a stationwagon finally arrives. Desperate, we decide to all pile in; the Downhill Battle people and me all lying together in the trunk. Someone snaps a photo. No rich metadata! Holmes cries. You can post it but I dont want it to be found by searching for my name.
 
We realize, piled into the trunk of a cabbies stationwagon, that the night is still young. We decide to ask the cabbie to drop us uptown near some bars. I ask Holmes if theyre sure they want me along, but Holmes is nothing if not accommodating and thinks well be able to make it work out.  When the cabbie drops us off, Holmes stops someone on the street and asks him if he can recommend any bars I might be able to sneak into. Not a chance! says the guy.
 
Undeterred, we head to the first bar we spot. One of the Battlers has a recently-expired ID whose photo looks a decent amount like me and I give it to the bouncer. He looks at it for a second and then lets me in. The actual battler holds back for a while and enters with the real ID soon after.
 
Its my first time in a bar and, like most such firsts, it is inevitably disappointing. It looks much like any other restaurant. Its quite stylish, with globe lights and fake branches as plants.  The waitress takes some orders and the music pounds. We sit in a booth and chat with our neighbors.
 
I first met Holmes at a party hosted by Zack Rosen months ago. Zack, who looked so at home when he was at a partywell, at home, now looks sort of out-of-place, like I often feel at parties. Unfortunately hes too far to talk to.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
Back at Tiffiniys apartment, theyre inflating a new raft. We all take turns getting lightheaded on hyperventilating over plastic fumes. We throw the raft on top of the car, each grabbing a side, and drive to the top of a hill overseeing a lake. Nick throws the raft onto the hill and we take turns sliding it down (its not a very steep hill). We throw the raft into the mud surrounding the lake. For a moment it looks like Im going to go with Tiffiniys friend, but this mistake is quickly rectified and I hang back with Tiffiniy until its our turn.
 
The sun is setting and the lake and trees are all drawn in pale blues and greens. The lake is like a shimmering mirror, the yellow raft hanging in the middle. When its our turn Tiffiniy goes in first and I go in after but end up slipping in the mud, falling on top of her, getting water in the boat, and getting myself all swampy. We embark anyway, using brooms brought from the apartment as paddles. The mood is slightly ruined, as are my clothes.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
The law school graduate fighting medicine patents is rather obviously hitting on Nick. Tell me your dreams, she says lusciously. Well, uh, Nick replies, stiff and nervous, our group tries to fight, uh, the expansion of, uh, copyright law by. No, she interrupts. Not the groups dreams  your dreams. Oh. Well, uh.
 
Weve left the bar and are now walking the streets in search of dancing, although we cant quite seem to remember the name of the place were heading for. Captain something, perhaps? Oh, there it is. We try to pull off the ID trick again, but were foiled by the $5 cover charge. Five dollars! someone exclaims. We head back to regroup. Law school girl heads in to see if she can pull out a friend.
 
Her friend is a shortish snobbish fellow, with a manner that was the subject of much derision but which is rather hard to describe. Oh, boy, theres sure a lot of you. Well, uh, I could probably get you and you in  who wants to actually get in?  yeah, you and you. He looks at me. Sorry buddy, but theres no way Im gettin you in. Holmes decides that maybe he doesnt want in and we head home, joking about what a jerk he was. Please, you could get in, he assures me.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
Back at Tiffiniys apartment, theyre cooking up some dinner. Ive taken off some of my more swampy clothes, borrowing some of Tiffiniys pants. Afterwards, we make plans to head over to a swimsuit-themed party. They call up their friend programmer, who I will call Sam, and invite him to come over. When Sam arrives, Nick suggests we discuss RSS, a prospect which Sam is not particularly enthusiastic about (and, to be honest, neither am I).
 
We apparently get to the swimsuit party a little too early, since nobody has really arrived yet. We stand in a circle and talk for a bit with the lights on and then mill about for a little while. Topics for conversation are not particularly forthcoming. Sam tries to spark a new one: I spent the day rereading Enders Game, he suggests. This sounds rather awkwardly geeky, but I cant help but chime in: Oh, I did that once too! Just sat started looking at it and before I knew it Id reread the whole thing. Whats Enders Game? asks one of the girls. Were apparently the only two who know.
 
Sam is clearly socially awkward so it doesnt surprise me too much when a little later he announces that hes heading home. But it does surprise the Downhill Battle folks. Word spreads that apparently Sam was asked to leave, which strikes me as a little much. I mean, he obviously wasnt a party person, but to throw him out?
 
It turns out that things are much stranger than that. In fact, Sams ex-girlfriend who broke up with Sam after cheating on him, is coming over soon and apparently they dont think he should be around for it. Holmes thinks this is monumentally unfair and, he later tells us, he seeks out the girl who asked Sam to leave and gets in her face. Maybe next time you could tell me in advance who I can and cant bring to your parties, he tells her.
 
Ive been watching the OC a lot, he later explains, and on that show if someone has a beef with someone else they just go right there and tell them. The Worcester scenes too small for people to be having beefs like this; its noxious. We just need to get this all out into the open. We could have a Worcester beef wiki. You know, youve got to write up everybody youve got a beef with.
 
So at the party, he just kept staying on the girl, asking her why Sam couldnt stay and what the problem is and she repeatedly declined to comment. Theyre never going to invite you back, someone comments. Oh, I knew that, Holmes says. I dont care. I dont want to go back if thats how theyre going to be.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
The Ford Foundation, foolishly, did not bring us all out here simply to hang out and party. Instead, theyve provided what I assume is the standard summit garb: a long white U-shaped conference table with a projector at one end along which we can type on our laptops while sharing insights. Such sessions are certainly popular, but Im not sure how effective they (as opposed to the discussions outside them) really are.
 
The last major one I went to was a alternative [music] compensation system (ACS) meeting hosted by Harvard Laws Terry Fisher. I took copious notes of the discussion, which Terry suggested I not post on my blog, but those dont seem to have been worth anything and instead what I remember is being snowed into the Sheraton Commander with Ed Felten and Ernest Miller and friends.
 
One problem is that such events have rather unclear goals, like fostering discussion. One can certainly have a conversation  two, maybe even three or four, people talking to each other  and one can have many such conversations. But one cannot have conversations involving groups of twenty or thirty people, especially when the topic is boring and the people are prone to speeches. Its just doesnt work. The only useful part, as the participants will readily attest, is the conversations in the hallways.
 
Still, you obviously want to go to such summits, if only for the prestige and fun of hanging out with such cool people. And something about such meetings seems to compress people, making them into more concentrated coolness than normally. Hanging out with the amazing Ed Felten at the ACS meeting led me to go home and apply to Princeton (where he teaches) and, as we will see later in this story, hanging out with the Downhill Battle people had a similar effect.
 
And so, Im in something of a bind, since I want to get invited to such meetings but I dont really like them. So I cant really talk about them much on my blog. Nor can I tell the organizer what I really think about them, although they always ask. And worst of all, I sort of tune out during the actual meeting-part conversations which makes me shy about speaking up lest I betray this fact, which in turn makes the organizer regret inviting me. I invited this Aaron kid because I thought he was a genius, they say to themselves, but he didnt say a word! (As a last ditch attempt to justify flying me out they try to pressure me into saying something but Im not very cooperative.) Its all so sad.
 
Winnetka, Illinois  Ninth Grade
 
But perhaps not as sad as me at a party. In junior high and high school we would routinely have what the school insisted on calling socials  basically dance parties. I was practically alone in almost never showing up and my classmates, who showed the same surprising social generosity I see in the Downhill Battle Kids, went so far as to start bribing me to come.
 
Even when I did come I mostly stood in the corner, perhaps twitching occasionally, maybe talking to some people. During a slow dance a girl finally grabbed me from the corner (perhaps even ditching her date) and pulled me out to the floor, putting her hands on my shoulders, as was the custom. I reacted, naturally, by putting my hands on her shoulders but a within a few seconds noticed this was quite wrong and that all the other men had their hands on either side of their partners waist, so I quickly corrected myself. I still had no idea what to do with my feet, but to my recollection I didnt do anything incredibly stupid with them, but I cant say the moment was particularly enjoyable, seeing as how I was gripped with fear the whole time.
 
Further bribes led me to try to participate in the bizarre actions that seem to make up modern dance, which make my twitching look tame by comparison. Dance has never really made a whole lot of sense to me, but its modern version is surely especially odd, consisting as it does mostly of people huddling close together and sort of writhing and shaking various appendages in some vague relation to the music.
 
The worst thing about it, however, is that stupid as it is you can do it poorly and look even stupider. And, as you might expect, falling from such an already low level could leave ones self-esteem at rather perilous lows. So in dancing, one tries to keep a sense of just how stupid one looks at this moment, in order to determine whether to cease such activity. Unfortunately for one, however, it is precisely this self-conscious monitoring that is the primary cause of poor dancing.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts  Present Day
 
Taking all this into account, I am sitting alone at a table in the kitchen with a neckache while dancing grows in the other room and people start smoking pot on the porch. Holmes, frustrated with the stereo system, has commandeered it and attached it to an iBook and is now downloading songs to play off a peer-to-peer network. Once he feels he has sufficient songs queued up he comes over and sits down with me.
 
Are you OK with just sitting here? he asks. Because I want to know if I should pressure you to come join us and I know there are some people who are just totally OK with who they are. Im rather surprised at the question and not really sure about how to articulate my feelings. Well, um, I say. No, then. If you have any question about it, then the answer is no. Well, I finally say. Right now, this person I am right now, has no desire to go dancing. But Im beginning to wonder if I should be a different sort of person.
 
This too apparently means no and Holmes drags me into the other room and I slowly begin twitching again, expanding until I reach a range which might be considered moderate dancing, which I still am not doing very well at. Holmes and friends decide to liven up the party but running into a mattress thats laid up against the wall a high speeds, causing them to bounce off of it and into the crowd. I decide to join in and its the first fun thing Ive done all night.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
One of the cooler groups here are the folks from Third World Majority (website cultureisaweapon.org, who manage to combine some of the most radical rants with support for the power of technology. The tech industry, as Thomas Frank superbly documents (notably in One Market Under God), consists mostly of radical politics as sham  letting 20-year-old kids run companies is supposed to replace economic democracy  but TWM has radical politics as extreme as anything Ive seen.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
A dark-skinned youth in what I guess are called hip hop clothes enters the party. He wasnt invited, he admits readily, but he saw the noise and decided to come by. Back in Illinois, Id have to say, theyd probably be trying to kick the kid out right about now, but these Worcester kids just toss him a beer. Conversation with him is perhaps a little strained, but theres no overt tension.
 
He invites a few of his friends over (which is probably exactly what the Illinois kids were afraid of) and while for the most part they associate among themselves, nobody seems to mind them.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
Aside from the Downhill Battle folks, the coolest person here is Hannah Sasserman of the Prometheus Radio Project. Prometheus, profiled in The Nations radio issue, started as a collective that started illegal pirate radio stations. The group has lately gone legit, lobbying for the legalization of Low-Power FM (LPFM) stations and building community radio stations instead of pirate ones. Hannah is intelligent and articulate and passionate and good at balancing the legal and illegal sides of her job. Shes definitely one to watch, I wrote a friend afterwards.
 
A professor asks if some students can practice by filming us and Hannah comments by saying something about them filming her ass. Its not supposed to be X-rated, the professor explains. Oh, dont worry, Hannah replies. My ass is not X-rated.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
Back at the Tiffiniys apartment, my neck still hurts, the pain crawling up towards my head as it usually does. As the party went on people begin taking off their clothes, revealing the swimsuits underneath (it was a swimsuit party, after all). Even Holmes strips down to some tight-fitting swimming trunks. Some of the girls even started swapping swimsuits. I think I finally understand what Aimee Mann meant when she sang trading clothes and ringing Pavlovs Bell.
 
We left probably around probably 4am. (I remember I once was at a rather geekier party and I was introduced to Miguel de Icaza. Miguel and I really didnt have all that much to talk about, so he started flipping his sexy cell phone open and closed and telling me about the dance parties he went to. Where he was from, he told me, the music didnt even start until 4am!)
 
I ask if theres any aspirin for my head and they tell me that the solution to headaches is to drink some water and eat stuff. I try this but tell them that I dont think its going to work and when I dont take aspirin in response to a neckache I generally end up waking in the middle of the night with a searing pain tearing apart my skull. After repeating this story several times in a rather subdued tone, they kindly get some aspirin from the local 24-hour pharmacy.
 
Holmes arrives later and debriefs us about the night, giving the above riff about the OC, which leads to a discussion about how things are much better on television. You know what else is good about the OC? The kids just totally ignore the parents. You want to go visit someone? You drive over there and next thing you know youre in their bedroom. I suggest that another good thing about the OC is that you get places instantly, but Holmes assures me that the shows realism includes actual driving.
 
Eventually we go to sleep  Im allowed to use the bed out on the glass-enclosed second-floor back porch.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
After the days long meeting were taken on a bus to a crowded fancy restaurant. Were stored in three tables up in the top floors corner. At one point I have to go down to the bathroom and I swear it looks just like the choreographed office number from Brazil: people in colorful clothing go up and down the stairs, a waiter with a tray cuts in front of me, a scenic view from the second floor over a crowded restaurant, people pass pieces of paper back and forth in front of me, all while a perfectly steady camera shot takes it all in.
 
Back at the table, I sit next to Tiffiniy. She says shes not feeling very well so she sort of slouches down in her chair quite a bit and to keep talking to her I slouch down and do face the same way. While were oblivious, someone snaps a photo and laughs and shows it to us. It looks like were swooningly in love.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
I wake up to the sun streaming through the glass ceiling. I get up and spend an hour just sort of staring at my hands. Later I head in and we go out to breakfast.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
After dinner a fellow from the Consumers Union (nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports, although theyre actually much more political than that would suggest) invites us over to his house, which looks a little like the kind of old abandoned places that people throw wild parties at in movies. He hasnt been letting the place go to waste though  he installed a large stripper pole in the middle of the living room.
 
Some loud music is put on and I head out to the back porch to escape it. Holmes decides to take a seat and as water starts squirting out from under him, he realizes hes sat in a puddle. He takes off his pants and throws them on the nearby barbecue, where they proceed to start steaming. It looks like smoke, of course, and one wonders what the neighbors think when they come out on their porch and observe us.
 
The Downhill Battle kids have brought their skateboards and we take turns trying them, the more adventurous racing down the hill. Just the driveways tilt is too much for me  things go too fast and I arch my back and scrape my wrist and knee.
 
I hang out with Tiffiniy on the front steps for a bit and then she grabs my hand and drags me across the street and over a fence, up some stairs into this amazing urban meadow between two houses thats been allowed to run wild, grass growing tall and crawling up a defunct fountain in the middle. Isnt this beautiful? she asks and indeed it is. After some time we head back and some time after that she heads off with some people to a bar. Do you want to come? she asks and I do but I also dont want to cause trouble again so I stay behind and head back to the hotel, looking at myself in the hotels many mirrors, checking out how I look in the tight-fitting Downhill Battle tee they gave me.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
We pile into a place that looks like your typical breakfast diner, ordering one and two dollar meals which Holmes pays for entirely in the quarters he has in his pockets. Holmes asks me what sort of political software I want to work on and I tell him that as Ive radicalized Ive had trouble thinking of software radical enough to keep up with my politics. But projects dont have to be explicitly political to have political effects, he says. Look at Wikipedia.
 
Yes, look at Wikipedia, I say. Wikipedia was founded by an Objectivist and its policies are explicitly anti-truth. Anti-truth? Wikipedias policy is truth through process. The Wikipedia npov policy page explicitly says that it doesnt matter whether something is true or not  it can only be put on a Wikipedia page if its popular. And that makes some sense from a certain perspective, but its certainly not political. In a messed-up society like ours, neutral policies dont have neutral effects. The process will just reinforce the status quo.
 
Does this really happen? Sure, I tried an experiment. I picked one page  the article on From Time Immemorial, a book that claimed there were really no Palestinians  and tried to tell the full story, which involved such shocking facts as that a journal article exposing the book as a fraud couldnt get published anywhere. My well-cited additions kept getting deleted and when I asked why someone explained on the talk page that what I was saying was silly  nobody rejects journal articles that are accurate. Well this was precisely the point I was trying to argue against!
 
So whats the solution? Does a wiki have to have an explicit political point of view? Well, thats one possibility  one that Im sort of trying. But a simpler answer is to just say that instead of only including things people believe, only include things you can provide citations for. Require people to provide evidence for their claims. Thats a much better way of getting truth and its much more useful too, since people can get the cites to learn more.
 
Washington, D.C.
 
The second day of the Free Culture meeting is much shorter and emptier. Under pressure, I give a short talk on my radical wikipedia and, shockingly, one of the people from Third World Majority comes up to me afterwards to note that shes actually used the site (which I havent even told anyone about). And then I say my goodbyes (Tiffiniy says it feels like the last day of summer camp) and drive to the airport with Zack Rosen, get onto my plane, and fly back to California.
 
Worcester, Massachusetts
 
After breakfast, the gang takes me on a small car tour around Worcester and then back to the train station. This didnt really work out the way I expected, Tiffiniy says. Were not usually this social. I thought we were just going to hold hands and walk around the city. Youll have to come back. Think of Worcester as your home. I thank them for their food and beds and tight-fitting pants and party invitations and so on and then head into the grandly architected Worcester station and onto the train and back to Boston.

Good writeup.  I didnt like the multiple city threads at first - and I still think the labels are confusing - but I think it ends up working.  It makes for a good parallel narrative once you can start ignoring the city names and just get into the narrative flow.  Above all, youre able to sustain interest, which is a narrative gift.  I also enjoyed Enders Game and once similarly slipped into rereading it.

Hi Aaron,
 
You did a good job capturing Worcester and the Worcester kids. I used to hang out with them years ago. I remember the feeling of the Collective, and how within one 24-hour period, the situation could go from raucous dance party to silence and staring at your hands. You also manage to convey here the strange paradox between intellectual showmanship and groupthink, which is so much a part of this Worcester scene.
 
Anyway, now I work for Advance Internet. I think either we or our parent company, bought reddit, which you invented?
 
Anyway, small world.

Title: The Intentionality of Evil
 
[ English |  | Deutsch ]
 
As children were fed a steady diet of comic books (and now, movies based off of them) in which brave heros save the planet from evil people. Its become practically conventional wisdom that such stories wrongly make the line between good and evil too clear  the world is more nuanced than that, were told  but this isnt actually the problem with these stories. The problem is that the villains know theyre evil.
 
And people really grow up thinking things work this way: evil people intentionally do evil things. But this just doesnt happen. Nobody thinks theyre doing evil  maybe because its just impossible to be intentionally evil, maybe because its easier and more effective to convince yourself youre good  but every major villain had some justification to explain why what they were doing was good. Everybody thinks theyre good.
 
And if thats the case, then intentionality doesnt really matter. Its no defense to say (to take a recently famous example) that New York bankers were just doing their jobs, convinced that they were helping the poor or something, because everybody thinks theyre just doing their jobs; Eichmann thought he was just doing his job.
 
Eichmann, of course, is the right example because it was Hannah Arendts book Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil that is famously cited for this thesis. Eichmann, like almost all terrorists and killers, was by our standards a perfectly normal and healthy guy doing what he thought were perfectly reasonable things.
 
And if that normal guy could do it, so could we. And while we could argue whos worse  them or us  its a pointless game since its our actions that were responsible for. And looking around, theres no shortage of monstrous crimes that weve committed.
 
So the next time you mention one to someone and they reply yes, but we did with a good intent explain to them thats no defense; the only people who dont are characters in comic books.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

HI Aaron
 
Did you read as well how  Hannah Arendt came to understand that it was the shallowness of his thinking that made it possible for Eichmann to go about his work as a murderer.
 
People without the time to think in depth can become dangerous people, much more able to think in the way that suspends there being a difference between right and wrong.
 
Have you ever noticed it will be a person up to no good who retorts: You think too much ?

Youre an idiot. People may indeed be ignorant of the fact that theyre evil, but they are intentionally ignorant of this fact.
 
You should go into the very worst neighbourhood of town. And you may get attacked. Your attacker knows hes evil. And hes 99.9% sure doing it for that new plasma tv, not for saving his daughter from cancer or something like that.
 
People may or may not be ignorant of the fact that theyre evil. But they have all the tools to find out. Especially the do not kill and the treat your neighbour as you would want him to treat you laws (that christianity accepts and islam rejects) will make you understand whether youre doing the right thing or not.
 
Yes we have limited information on the world. That doesnt mean we cant have at least pareto-efficiency in our morality towards eachother. That does require a few things, like being at least partially religious (and religious as in Jew Christian or Buddhist, especially not Hindu, Muslim or Shinto).
 
So I respectfully (but completely) disagree. You can know perfectly well if youre being moral or not. Yes you cannot know the implications of your actions. But you can be pareto moral. And thats already enough morality to create a very good society.
 
And btw Ive never commited any horrible crime, so stop blaming me for any of those things. Maybe some ancient family members of me have. Yes maybe I even still profit by their crimes. I do not pretend to have the right to judge them, nor do I accept any shred of responsability for their actions. I have personally commited wrongs, and even crimes, and Ill accept responsability for them, and try to fix them where possible, but you can, again respectfully, fuck off when you try to blame me (individually or collectively) for stuff like the crusades or WOII or black slavery or 
 
And dont kid yourself : those people knew very well that what they did was wrong. Thats what makes it a crime.

Theres a perfectly simple and direct test for evil.
If a person is utterly convinced of the correctness of his/her position and refuses to even contemplate that they might perhaps be in error  if they never step back to question themselves and re-check the belief structures for inconsistency (or become blind to or ignore inconsistencies when pointed out), then they are following the path of evil.
 
Self-doubt is a necessary condition for Good.

The idea of evil is a concept that is socially generated.  I think that all of the people as well as the writer are forgetting that.  Nazi Germany (a very tired excuse, but it is the only one that comes to mind) was a society in which anti Semitism was used to explain the economic hardships that occurred with the shift of state from agrarian to capitalist.  It was a tool used by the members of the elite to maintain their power over the masses.  This was happening at the same time that say, France was post revolution and bursting with ideas of individual liberty and many of the ideals that are seen as essential to the notions of liberty we consider as something of a backbone to our democracy.
 
Are you telling me that a German knew that they were doing the wrong thing when they voted in Hitler on his policy to annihiliate the Jews?  How could they?  The Church, the state and almost the entirety of academics were telling them (and had told their forebears for centuries) that the Jews were the cause of their problems.  What mind can stand up to that kind of persistent barrage of information? As for God, the church themselves backed the racists pretty much as soon as they realised the power of this type of politics.
 
We believe what we believe because at the moment we have grown up with certain sentiments.  Do not imagine that we have in any way any different understanding of life.  We believe what we are told, just as they did.  Stop separating yourselves from the people that you believe to be evil, because we understand life just as they did.  You are no better then them, no one person is better than another.  You just have a different understanding of life.  I would suggest that everyone dismount their very high horses, and examine their own beliefs, taking into account where they emerged from.

I agree with this for the most part.  I dont think there is any way to label good and evil.  Each and every person has a different view on what is right and wrong.  I think there are people who intentionally do bad things because they LIKE doing it, but I think there are also people who do bad things because they think it is the right thing to do.  Now, it may or may not be, but that just depends on the person analyzing it.  Theres no way to label right and wrong, considering there is literally two sides to every argument and action.  Interesting thoughts though; I dont understand why people are attacking them so much.

@Constantnormal:
 
So no evil act has ever been committed by someone who was only mostly sure it was the right thing to do?  Self-doubt is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one.
 
(And actually its probably possible to live a life without evil or doubt, provided that you really never do anything of note)
 
(Also, people without doubt can sometimes achieve marvels.  There will be suffering with those marvels, but thats not to say wed judge those lives evil in every instance).

Title: The Immorality of Freakonomics
 
As the hype around the book Freakonomics reaches absurd proportions (now an international bestseller, the authors have been signed for a monthly column in the New York Times Magazine), I think its time to discuss some of the downsides that I mostly left out of my main review. The most important of which is that economist Stephen Levitt simply does not appear to care  or even notice  if his work involves doing evil things.
 
The 1960s, as is well-known, had a major civilizing effect on all areas of American life. Less well-known, however, was the immediate pushback from the powerful centers of society. The process involved a great number of things, notably the network of right-wing think tanks Ive written about elsewhere, but in the field of education it led to a crackdown on those institutions
which have played the major role in the indoctrination of the young, as a contemporary report (The Crisis of Democracy) put it.
 
The indoctrination centers (notably schools) werent doing their job properly and so a back-to-basics approach with more rote memorization of meaningless facts and less critical thinking and intellectual development was needed. This was mainly done under the guise of accountability, for both students and teachers. Standardized tests, you see, would see how well students had memorized certain pointless facts and students would not be allowed to deviate from their assigned numbers. Teachers too would have their jobs depend on the test scores their students got. Teachers who decided to buck the system and actually have their students learn something worthwhile would get demoted or even fired.
 
Not surprisingly, as always happens when you make peoples lives depend on an artificial test, teachers begun cheating. And it is here that Professor Levitt enters the story. He excitedly signed up with the Chicago Public School system to try to build a system that would catch cheating teachers. Levitt and his co-author write excitedly about this system and the clever patterns it discovers in the data, but mostly ignore the question of whether helping to get these teachers fired is a good idea. Apparently even rogue economists jump when the government asks them to.
 
Levitt has a few arguments  teachers were setting students up to fail in the higher grade they would be advanced to  but these are tacked on as afterthoughts. Levitt never stops to ask whether contributing to the indoctrination of the young or getting teachers fired might not be an acceptable area of work, despite being an economist, he never weighs any benefits or even considers the costs.
 
Levitt, by all appearances, was not, like some of his colleagues, a self-conscious participant in this regressive game. He was just a rube who got taken in. But surely preventing others from the same fate would be a more valuable contribution.

Title: SFP: Fire Alarm
 
One of the hazards of dorm life is that fire alarms are always going off. At Stanford, heres how it went the three or four times it happened last year: an alarm would go off, I wouldnt hear it because I was in my room with my headphones on or asleep, eventually Id notice or get woken up, Id throw on my pants and walk downstairs and outside, where a group of kids would accumulate. After what seemed like an interminable wait in the shivering cold, a fire truck would show up, the firemen would walk inside and, after a couple minutes, walk out again. Then everybody would go back into the building even though nothing was actually explained.
 
As it turns out, it worked much the same way here at MIT, except they have a new high tech talking fire alarm in every room to recite a paragraph of instructions  twice  before telling you to leave the building. When I got outside, there were much fewer people (it is summer after all) but and the fire trucks showed up much more quickly. And there were two of them! And after that, some policemen in their blue uniforms. And then, inexplicably, a gray MIT-logo van pulled up and a bunch of fat guys in suspenders (but no uniform) got out and went inside.
 
But still, no explanation.

Title: SFP: Dinner with Dan
 
One of the many nice things about living at MIT is that Stuff Happens Here. Just down the street, for example, is the Frank Gehry-designed Stata Center (photos (my favorite)) which hosts, among many other things, the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (LCS+AI Lab=CSAIL), the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Noam Chomsky, and so on.
 
The W3C happens to be hosting their Technical Architecture Group meeting, where the Webs biggest minds come together to argue about such pressing issues as whether a URL can be said to refer to a physical object, like a truck. Dan Connolly, who might be considered the #2 guy at the W3C (after Tim Berners-Lee, the Webs inventor, of course), saw that I was in Cambridge and invited me to come over this evening.
 
When I got there he introduced me to fellow TAG members Norm Walsh (who some readers may know as the DocBook guy) and Henry Thompson (author of xsv) and we all headed to a pool hall. Tired from a long day arguing about such weighty subjects, they tried to avoid talking about them, which ended up meaning that they mostly talked about pool. Id never played pool before but in two games I was able to make one or two half-way decent shots. I need to work on doing all the various things at once.
 
Dan Connolly is very dismissive of my swearing off of competitive games. Oh, pool isnt pool a competitive game? he sneered to me in email. (To be honest, playing was sort of a breach.) And when I described the application process he grumbled about it sounding competitive. (It wasnt a game, though!) I assume its because Dans a social conservative. While we were walking there someone suggested a union picket line might just be an attempt to extort money and on the way back there were grumbles about people who didnt know well enough to pay off credit card debts. (Why isnt this taught in school? they wondered.)
 
After pool, we headed over to a restaurant just next door and ordered food. Sitting in the little booth, as we talked about friends and food, I realized how absurdly detailed TAG problems really are. Did Ma Bell have a department that sat and thought about the meaning of a phone number? A team to come up with recommendations about the uses of a phone? Surely this is the only technology in history to have such philosophical problems.
 
As we walked into town, Dan told us excitedly about the weekly CSAIL hockey game, which Id never heard of before. Then we parted ways and I headed home and called my mom.

Title: SFP: First Contact
 
Most of what a startup  or at least this startup  is about is solving various technical problems, fixing bugs, getting stuff done. At its worst, this stuff is boring to do. And even at its best its hard to describe and not much fun to hear. On the plane here I wrote a memoir about my time with the W3C and what was striking was not just that I omitted all the technical stuff from the story but that I dont even remember the technical stuff. People stuff, on the other hand
 
So Ive been holed up by myself in this elegant MIT dorm room. (more photos (my favorite)) Jessica (formerly 4 of 4 from Y Combinator, the group thats funding the startup Im working on) stopped by to drop off a lifesaving air conditioner and we chatted for a bit. I get out once or twice a day to go get food at someplace nearby. And at nights I sleep. But most of the time I just work.
 
Y Combinator has weekly meetings where all the startups go over to their offices for dinner. I missed last weeks because I didnt have a dorm and so when I get there I dont recognize anyone. I sort of wander around alone trying not to look too stupid, which is what I normally do at parties anyway.
 
At some point we sit down at a long table with benches that theyve placed in the room, which looks even nicer than before, with elegantly placed lights and abstract art on the walls. During some pre-dinner conversation someone makes a pun. You know, I read somewhere that bad puns are highly correlated with IQ, Paul says. I find that hard to believe, responds a founder, I know some people who make lots of puns and, well Correlations arent perfect, responds another. And IQ isnt necessarily correlated with intelligence, comments Paul. I was really glad to see hed backed off this claim. (I was thinking about chiming in but I was at the very edge of the table and planning to save my disagreements until after the money is in the bank.)
 
They plan to get a guest speaker each dinner; this week it was a patent attorney, who admitted that patents were expensive and not very useful to a startup he suggested (and cited a study that argued) they would be useful later on. He gave us all packets and branded cell phone holders but I forgot to take mine home.
 
Afterwards there was more talking. One group of founders described their history. Well, we havent really done any legitimate businesses before, they said. What illegitimate businesses have you done? I asked. Oh, adult entertainment, student term papers  nothing illegal but not the sort of things you want to show to VCs!
 
I got to talk to rtm which was really wonderful and at some point I found myself in a conversation with Paul and a couple other people. Paul asked me if I could send him a copy of the infamous paper and another person chimed in oh youre definitely sending me a copy. Wait, you know about this? asked Paul. You dont? replied the third person. It turned out everyone there had read my blog. Oh, said Paul, I only started reading it when it started mentioning me!
 
Not long afterward a group of people behind me pulled me away and introduced themselves. And who are you? they asked. Paul, from behind me, said this is Aaron Swartz; you dont know who Aaron Swartz is? He co-authored RSS! Oh, said the kid, well then you made me quite a bit of money!
 
At some point Jessica pulled me aside to go over the legal paperwork of which there is quite a bit.
 
A group of Russian kids offered to drive me home in their van. Were actually agents from the KGB, they explained, laughing, in their thick Russian accents, we were sent here to spy on you. We bought a van because we were told all Americans drive vans. We try to blend in. They certainly made the most of it, swerving back and forth across the street and making crazy turns. Amazingly, though, we managed to find my place and they dropped me off.

Title: Stanford/SFP: Leaving on a Jet Plane
 
Its always odd how extraordinary things are just like their ordinary counterparts. Stanford is just like a school, only wealthier. Leaving home is just like going on vacation, only longer. And packing your dorm is just like packing up your hotel room, only bigger.
 
Tonight the campus is so desolate: people missing, cars missing. Even the room is beginning to seem empty, although the hallways are filled with crud. Im the last one left in our room of four people. With all my schoolwork done, its surprisingly lonely. I wander down to talk to other people packing.
 

 

 

 
As I wait outside with my bags the next morning, kids slowly filer out and sit on the top of the picnic table, just like the cool kids do in television shows to indicate coolness. I sit away in the shade on the chair. Eventually my ride shows up and the group of kids waves goodbye. I wonder how many of them Ill see again.
 
Bags are heavy. Its a good thing I didnt take public transportation  theres no way I would have made it. Not to mention the fact that when I get here a voice over the speakers says that public transportation is currently out. I wait in line for a long time at the curb until I get to the front and they tell me they cant check my bags anymore. Then I spend a while running around looking for a cart machine that will take my money, then I take the cart over to another long line and pay a lot of money to take my bags on the plane. Good thing Im early. I still have two heavy bags to carry all the way to the terminal, unfortunately. Somehow I survive without any major damage.
 
On the plane I read a long book which inspires me to write a long memoir.
 
I then carry the heavy bags down to the baggage claim, buy another cart, grab the bags of the conveyor belt, take them to the cab stand and ask the cab driver to go to MIT. He doesnt know where Simmons Hall is so he tells me to stop him when we get close. I scan the windows, seeing nothing but empty fields and abandoned warehouses when BOOM! this huge building pops up, much larger than it seems in pictures. Thats it! I say and the cabdriver backs up. He places my stuff on the curb as I pay him and speeds off.
 
Inside an alienated student mans the desk, her lowered eyes not-so-subtly implying that she really doesnt want to talk to me. I tell her Im checking in. Oh, she says in a dry monotone, youre that guy. I thought youd be older. She gives me a key and asks me to fill out a confusing form, continually finding spots I havent filled out. No, fill out everything  you left the box that says # of children blank. While Im doing this some police come in and ask how to get to tower B, she points them to the elevator at the end of the hall.
 
Finally I finish filling out the form and ask her how to get to my room. She looks it up and concludes its in tower B, take the elevator at the end of the hall. I decide to go on an exploratory mission with just one bag to find my room before carrying everything down. Its a good thing I did since the elevator is surrounded by three cops. In front of them, the elevator door is open revealing a whole group of kids in an elevator stuck halfway between floors. The kids seem resigned to their situation and are now sitting on the floor playing games. I dont trust these f-ing elevators, says one cop. No way, me neither, answers another. I decide to back away to give them some space.
 
After a short rest I decide to try the other elevator and it turns out its much closer, so I laboriously drag my bags up and thru using it. On the way to my room there is a picture window onto a deck with some sort of yin-yang sculpture. The kids have filled it up with water and place rubber duckies into it. Unfortunately, getting onto the deck requires a keycard, which I dont have.
 
Simmons Hall is indeed pretty, if a little warm. (Apparently the computer lab is the only air conditioned room.) Meeting rooms of various sorts are scattered throughout the place, each fitted with a whiteboard and prints from Josef Alberss Interaction of Color.
 
Oddly, each print is also accompanied by a note with a number to call with questions and concerns about the artwork. (I imagine the MIT student who calls and says I have a concern about print #49. Albers clearly intended to use a 3,4,5 sequence but on the last square here its printed as 3,4,6. Do you think you could send someone to take care of this?)
 
There are also a series of kitchens and TV rooms, each differently shaped and furnished. Each TV room has a DVD player, VCR, and stairs up to the next floor where, in a different location, there is another room with a different shape and furnishings.
 
The floor plans of the building are printed by the elevator (for use in case of fire, I guess) and theyre rather entertaining. They look just like normal floor plans  squares and boxes with symbolic codes  except its apparently been hit by a meteor, since theres a big squiggly-shaped hole right in the middle where the TV room is.
 
In one of the meeting rooms I found a large box someone had built out of wood, the inside covered in foam padding. Inside was a strange-looking device, a switch, and a bunch of wires. Outside was a light (currently off) that said DIRECT FROM THE FUTURE. I tried figuring out what the box was, with little success. The whole thing felt like a puzzle out of Myst or something.
 
The one thing I couldnt find, however, was a bathroom on my floor. I found a whole series of locked rooms with interesting labels  Counseling, Student Government, Mail, Music, and my personal favorite (if only because it was the one with no lock) Meditation  but no bathroom. Finally I tried to open the unmarked door next to my room and aha! a bathroom. Nice location, too. The only problem is it doesnt have lock.
 
The next day as I walk outside Im hit in the face by Cambridges dreadful weather. Unbearably snowy in the winter, its unbearably hot and muggy in the summer. I guess it wasnt just because I was carrying bags yesterday that I was sweating. I walk the superblock to the student center where I get some food and buy a fan for my room. It makes things a little better but its still pretty terrible.
 
Anyone in Cambridge got an air conditioner I could borrow? Maybe I should find someplace to buy one. UPDATE: The good folks at Y Combinator brought me over an air conditioner which we jammed into one of the windows and now its awesome. Thanks!
 
Finally, if anyone nearby wants to visit, just drop me an email.

Title: SFP: Home, Sweet, Home
 
I started looking for an apartment as soon as we headed out to Cambridge for an interview but few things had been made available yet. Then the server died and I was distraught for a while. By the time I started looking again, few things were available and in the past few weeks things have gotten increasingly desperate.
 
We went through craigslist and made up a list of options, but each one seemed to fall apart upon investigation. Occasionally, especially as deadlines moved closer, I would stumble across an amazing deal and throw all of my hope into it, convincing myslf that wed get it and all would work out fine. These deals repeatedly collapsed, eventually leaving me where I was this morning: at Stanford, without an apartment or a plane ticket, and getting kicked out the next morning.
 
My dad, thankfully, was at MIT this week and he took some time to go down to the housing office and investigate their options. He discovered that it was possible to get an MIT dorm room and pay by the night and suggested I stay there while I figured out a more long-term place to stay.
 
I was not looking forward to move out of one dorm room just to move into another, but then he found that MITs beautiful Simmons Hall (aka the bubble wrap building  Sean insists it looks like a Tetris reject) was available to stay in. Id always admired photos of Simmons Hall, thought of trying to find an excuse to visit, even considered going to MIT because of it (until I realized that there was little chance Id get to stay there). And now I was getting to stay there  apparently we might even be able to stay there for the whole summer.
 
So I signed up for a few nights  got an amazingly low room rate  and bought a plane ticket for tomorrow morning  also surprisingly cheap and perfect (I thought Id have to leave out of some obscure airport and stop in some obscure hub, but its direct from SF!). Procrastination really worked out this time, it seems. Too bad I didnt get this kind of peace of mind earlier; then I could have spent the week on the town! (Although I did have some fun Segwaying with Seth and going to dinner with some of Apples Safari team)
 
Now I just need to finish packing.

Title: Sneak Peek
 
VOICEOVER: Aaron Swartz: The Stanford Diaries will return in September. Heres a sneak preview of what to expect next season.
 
KIEFER SUTHERLAND appears in a completely black room.
 
KIEFER: Hi, Im Kiefer Sutherland. You might know me better as Aaron Swartz in Aaron Swartz: The Stanford Diaries. (beat) Its been an exciting year, culminating in a jam-packed season finale. But thats not all there is to the story. Next year, I again play Aaron Swartz in Aaron Swartz: The Stanford Diaries, but this time theres a whole lot more to the story.
 
AARON SWARTZ and UNSEEN TEACHER meet in a parking garage. Teacher stays in the shadows, face never revealed, although he or she is clearly wearing a trenchcoat.
 
AARON: Oh, hey. I just wanted to tell you I read that book you recommended.
 
TEACHER: Oh, good!
 
AARON: Well, I guess Ill see you next year.
 
As Aaron turns to head away the teacher GRABS him by the arm.
 
TEACHER: Wait, theres something I need to tell you.
 
AARON: Oh?
 
TEACHER: I read your last paper, Aaron. That wasnt appropriate.
 
AARON: What do you mean?
 
TEACHER: I think you know what I mean.
 
AARON: The assignment was to write about sex, the body, or reproduction. I wrote about sex.
 
TEACHER: Well, in the context of what you said to me, I had to take it to the sexual harrassment center. We just had a consult about it and its going in your file, but theyre not opening an investigation on you or anything. Im sure you didnt mean it as harrassment but I had to take it to them just to be safe.
 
AARON: Oh. OK.
 
TEACHER: I didnt really have a choice, Aaron, given what you said. Dont worry, youre not in trouble or anything.
 
AARON: I said OK. Is there anything more you can tell me?
 
TEACHER: Well, its confidential.
 
AARON: But its about me! I waive my confidentiality rights.
 
KIEFER: Was the sexual harrassment claim responsible for the meeting with [unnamed authority figure]? Will this file open on Aaron cause later misunderstandings to be seen in a negative light, causing Aaron to be suspended or even expelled for the things he said, forcing him to turn around and hire the right-wing Foundation for Individual Rights in Education to sue Stanford University under Californias Leonard Law which extends First Amendment protection to private universities? Who knows? I just read the scripts they give me.
 
The actual AARON SWARTZ marches out in front of Kiefer.
 
AARON: OK, thats enough. Hi, Im Aaron Swartz, author of Aaron Swartz: The Stanford Diaries. Despite the 24 season finale and Deep Throat references Ive chosen to use in this post, Id just like to let folks out there know that this meeting actually did happen, although not in a parking garage.
 
KIEFER: Are we done here because, uh, Ive got some people in my trunk I need to take care of.
 
AARON: Yeah, let me give you a  hand with that.
 
Kiefer and Aaron walk off into the SUNSET that has just appeared in their solid black room.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

Hello Kiefer Sutherland,
 
Great name!  I am a huge fan of your work, especially 24.  Keep up the great work!

Title: Stanford: Season Finale
 
June 3
 
Nobody likes being called to the principals office. Even in high school when the principal was cool  Id tell him school was harmful and should be abolished, hed agree, and wed talk about it  it still felt wrong. And it always felt worse when, as surprisingly often was the case, the powerful man in the big chair talked about how powerful you, the puny little pushed-around student, were.
 
I remember the time in 7th grade that the teacher told me to leave the room and fill out one of his dispute resolution forms  his method of classroom discipline. I resisted by filling out the form in an absurd manner, because the whole thing was just so degrading. Then the teacher complained that I was being condescending! (A few years later, after the 7th grade teacher had moved out to a cabin in the Pacific Northwest with my 6th grade teacher, he came back to school and seemed much cooler, so I dont think it was really his fault.)
 
You sure werent rich, didnt live in the city
Didnt whisper sweet nothings, never told me Im pretty
 
All this by way of saying I received a rather discomfitting feeling when [unnamed authority figure] sent me a cryptic note saying she wanted me to come see her. I asked her about what but she never replied. (She later explained that she meant to but it just got behind.)
 
Worried, I asked a few people about what [unnamed authority figure] did. Have you committed any crimes recently? asked one. Not that I know of, I said. Maybe I kill people in my sleep? But how do I dispose of the bodies? The lakes already run dry! Another, always optimistic, insisted it must be a good thing. They wouldnt have her deliver bad news. It can only be good. I wasnt buying it.
 
As I walked to the meeting, there was a different disposition. I heard a girl screaming her lungs out and then slapping her boyfriend, who had apparently cheated on her. The boyfriend was desperately penitent, insisting it was just an accident, not a pattern, and that he loved her.
 
You cheated at cards, and lied when you hung out
in bars making time with those girls you called old pals
 
None of this eased my discomfort, nor did the fact that I had a major assignment due in a couple hours. 90% of my grade in one class depended on what work I turned in today by 5pm and I hadnt really started on it. I tried to do it last night but I couldnt bring myself to do it until I was too tired to make any progress. I wasnt sure Id have any better luck this morning.
 
When I finally saw [unnamed authority figure] she was so happy that I couldnt stop myself from smiling. Maybe she was right  maybe it was good news. Then we sat down. I wanted to talk to you about some of your behavior, she began. Oh, this wasnt going to be good.
 
I cried when you left me,
now Im wondering when youll make it all up to me?
 
She said shed been tipped off by my IHUM TF, which was odd, since wed just had a long talk a week ago or so and I thought wed worked everything out. Not that there really was a whole lot to work out. Actually, that talk probably just made it worse.
 
But then shed done her own research and begun telling me what shed uncovered:
 
Shed pulled my admissions applications and saw that I was really self-schooled, meaning I was probably a bit more isolated or sheltered from your peers than might be typical.
 
She checked with the Residence Dean at my dorm and found I was too shy to ask someone for help moving a filing cabinet.
 
She also heard (amazingly) that Id written some hurtful things about a young woman I was dating.
 
The TF had said that I once blurted something out in class, which I dont really remember specifically but certainly seems plausible.
 
The TF also claimed that once I had jumped out at her and said boo.
 
The TF also said that Id once said she went to a lower-class school and suggested I was trying to call her authority into question.
 
It paints an interesting picture for me, she said. I laughed to myself. Heh, its just like one of those television season finales, you know, where the main characters get called before an authority figure who then proceeds to list everything theyve done over the season, only its all a little off and a little out-of-context. Like that Seinfeld finale, where everyone theyd ever met started to testify against them. (See how I self-consciously point out the clichs Im in? Let it never be said that this blog is not post-modern!)
 
It certainly was an interesting picture. I was beginning to sound sort of autistic or something. I feel like Ive made a couple mistakes, I said, but doesnt everyone? The difference is that mine are just a little more public and mine are the ones being scrutinized. If reality TV has taught us anything, its that you can find something in anything, if you look hard enough.
 
Dont I have the right to be over you yet?
Ive tried pretending. I tried to forget.
 
We kept talking  for a half-hour altogether  but every time I tried to tell her about myself it just kept sounding worse. The facts were all able to fit the frame.
 
Well, what suggestions do you have? I finally asked. One strange thing about me is that I love hearing negative things about myself. You do? she replied. Yeah, I guess most people, when they receive nasty letters, they feel bad or something. But I love them  the nastier the better. the ones that are all obscentities just make my day.
 
Why? she asked. I dont know, I said and thought about it. Theres this theory, I said, thats very popular in our society that people have certain specific attributes, like personality traits. So some people are smart and other people are funny and thats just how it is.
 
I dont believe that. I think people are malleable. I think Im malleable. So whe I hear something negative, I dont think oh no, Im a bad person, I think well, thats something I can work on. She didnt seem convinced.
 
Well, she didnt want to punish me or anything, she said, and she didnt know me well enough to give any specific advice, but she suggested I talk to my friends (I tried to persuade her that I had some) and ask them about my outbursts and empathy.
 
Though its past three AM, I would still let you in
cause I cant go on dreaming alone.
 
I couldnt find anything to take to lunch to read, which is generally a sign Ill find someone to talk to. And sure enough I found one of those friends and sat down. Do you think I have problems with empathy? I asked him. Uhhh, I dont know, he said. Why? I told him the story. Heh, thats pretty funny, he said. You got called to the principals office for hurting someones feelings.
 
Afterwards, when my friend has left and Im all alone, a hand grabs my shoulder. I spin around but I dont recognize its owner. Hey, Schwartz, Im really sorry you didnt win evil dictator last night, he says. Uh-huh, I mumble. I voted for you, he says. Oh. Thank you, I say and walk away. After a few seconds I realize what hes referring to  the dorm passed out surveys for things like funniest guy and so on and announced the results in a Family Feud-style gameshow last night. Maybe I have more friends than I think.

Title: The God Who Wasnt There (And The One Who Was)
 
I was doing some research into the idea that Jesus never existed. When I first looked into it, I thought it was just a crackpot theory and I was curious why anyone would believe this, explains Brian Flemming. To my surprise I found the evidence kept stacking up. The more I looked into it, the more that the facts aligned with those who said Jesus was just a legendary character. The shaky evidence and the poor reasoning were actually on the side of those who said that Jesus did exist.
 
And so Flemming (Bat Boy: The Musical, Nothing So Strange, Fair & Balanced, and all-around digital rights supporter) decided to make a movie. The result, which is currently being screened across the country in theaters and at atheist organizations and will be released on DVD soon, is a shockingly good film.
 
Flemming begins at the beginning: the popular story of Jesus. In a hilarious montage of old footage taken from the Prelinger archives underneath deadpan narration, he tells the story in six minutes. And then its on to debunking it. Through interviews with various experts, illustrated with entertaining graphics, he tries to reconstruct the historical evidence for the storyonly to find there isnt much and a lot doesnt add up.
 
Convinced the story is wrong, Flemming takes aim at the right-wing Christian fundamentalists who act based on it, the wishy-washy Christian moderates who enable them, and the rest of the system. He concludes by heading back home to the fundamentalist Christian school he attended as a child to confront the principal about what hes teaching children.
 
Flemmings previous film, Nothing So Strange (which I also reviewed) was interesting but, in fairness, rather amateurish. No such criticism can be made of this film, which has some of the best graphics Ive seen in a documentary and a brilliant score composed from the Creative Commons-licensed Wired CD by the hertofore-unknown DJ Madson (a nom-de-plume of Flemming, Im beginning to suspect) by remixing popular artists. The whole thing, from the interviews down to the promotional posters, hangs together so well that its hard to believe Flemming is doing this all himself, but apparently he is, with no liberal atheist conspiracy to back him.
 
(Although, in full disclosure, Larry Lessig and former Creative Commons executive director Glenn Otis Brown receive special thanks in the credits. And in a remote Q&A via iChat after the screening here at Stanford, Flemming was wearing a Creative Commons shirt. So if you want to investigate a conspiracy, thats where Id look.)
 
On the other hand, Flemming has always had what Bill OReilly might call a parasitic sense of self-promotion. His film Nothing So Strange received press largely because it included scenes of Bill Gates being assassinated. And during the California Recall, Flemming jumped into the fray on the platform If elected, I will resign. (Thus making Lt. Governor Bustamante governor, since at the time he was refusing to run, thinking hed draw support away from the actual governor.) When FOX sued Al Franken for using the phrase Fair and Balanced, Flemming wrote a play with the name. When Arnold Schwarzenegger sued the makers of a bobblehead version of him, Flemming posted a photo of Arnolds penis.
 
Both times, he insisted the works were a form of political protest, but he still charged money for the products. He did the same when he released portions of  Nothing So Strange under a Creative Commons license. Its one thing to support free speech; its another to try to make money off of other peoples support for it. Whats unsettling about this film is not how Flemming is using various atheist groups to screen and promote it  thats perfectly reasonable, especially since hes giving the DVDs to the groups at outrageously low prices.
 
No, whats unsettling is a hidden feature on Flemmings site called the Grassroots Promotion Team or GPT. In general these things are nothing new  just personally, I remember volunteering for Apple when the iMac came out and joining a Street Team website to promote a Buffy DVD. The idea behind such sites is that your particular group of obsessive lonely fans will spend their free time promoting your products on various forums and websites in exchange for a chance to win some lame prizes.
 
Its sad when big corporations do this, but when independent political folks like Flemming do it, it becomes a little creepy. Its also problematic. Take the movies soundtrack, which is sold on Amazon. Normally such obscure CDs have hardly any reviews. But this one not only had 11, but they were all amazingly glowing. Wow, this CD must be really good, I thought. But when I saw Flemming was awarding 100 points for each Amazon review, it suddenly made sense. If everyone plays this game, Amazon reviews will quickly become meaningless, which is why I dont think its a very good idea to start.
 
The film is valuable and grassroots promotion of it is certainly a good thing. I just wish it felt a little less like using well-meaning people to make money for Flemming and a little more like a cooperative community with the aim of spreading the Real News.
 
Brian Flemming responds:
 
Thanks for the kind words about the movie. I agree with some of your
criticism of the street team, but I think your aim is off the mark with
much of it.
 
AMAZON REVIEWS. Theres an old phrase in publicity, I dont care if
the review is positive or negative, just put the title in the
headline. As an indie filmmaker always struggling to get the word out
against competing messages backed by tens of millions of dollars, I
definitely subscribe to this philosophy. It was never the design of the
movies street team to load up Amazon with praise (frankly, a mix of
angry one-star reviews and passionate five-star reviews would be
better). Its no secret that authors and their publishers and friends
stack the  Amazon book reviews (as has been documented), but I dont
wish to add to that clutter. Ive never asked anyone to post nice
things on Amazon about the soundtrack CD for The God Who Wasnt There,
or to withhold negative statements (and I have not posted a review
myself). Street team members are given a free (digital) copy of the
soundtrack and encouraged to go to Amazon and post a review of the
musicthats it. About 5% of them do. Theres no incentive to make the
review positive or negative. However, while I think the street team
members reviews of the soundtrack CD on Amazon are sincere, and no
harm has been done, this particular sample does naturally skew
positiveif youre on the street team, you probably like the
film/soundtrack youve decided to back with your time. But then again,
reviews are inherently biasedand fans tend to be more motivated than
others in posting. Most reviews on Amazon for most media products are
positive for that reason. Ill freely admit to sending people to
Amazonbut my goal is battling obscurity, not battling negative
opinion. And I certainly cant stop anyone from posting a negative
review.
 
THE STREET TEAM ITELF. A street team is a group of volunteer
supporters who distribute flyers and stickers and otherwise spread the
word about a band or film online and offline. You say, Its sad when
big corporations do this, but when independent political folks like
Flemming do it, it becomes a little creepy. Heres where I think your
aim is considerably off the mark. To be opposed to a street team is
nearly tantamount to being opposed to the very idea of promoting indie
artists. I believe promotion should be honest and ethical, but
promotion itself is not an evil. And organizing promotion is not an
evil. To eliminate street teams would be largely to give up and turn
over the marketplace to those who have the money to promote via
advertising and other expensive means. It would strengthen messages
backed by money and weaken messages backed by passion. I think the
street team for The God Who Wasnt There is a great example of passion
being organized into action, and Im proud of it. I give theatrical
rights away for freeand then a group like SF Atheists holds a
screening and earns upwards of $1000 to help their extremely important
efforts. Volunteers go to a website where grassroots action is made
easierand conversations all over the web get started over whether
Jesus really did exist, a very legitimate question that is nonetheless
the third rail of mainstream-media conversations about Christianity.
Street teams arent creepy, and this one in particular is doing some
very real, verifiable good.
 
MONEY. You write that when I attacked Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bill
OReilly via Fair Use Press, I insisted the works were a form of
political protest, but [Flemming] still charged money for the products.
He did the same when he released portions of  Nothing So Strange under
a Creative Commons license. Its one thing to support free speech; its
another to try to make money off of other peoples support for it.
Really, Im just shaking my head in wonder at this accusation. I have
never made any profit whatsoever from any of my Fair Use Press e-books.
The Schwarzenegger attack was given away, with a high-res premium
edition sold at first for $1 (both editions are free now and have been
for about a year). I added a $1 price to that specifically to
demonstrate fair usethat I wasnt taking a noncommercial copout, so
Schwarzenegger and his attorney couldnt claim thats why they didnt
sue. Thats what my activism through Fair Use Press is
aboutdemonstrating the limits of fair use. I want people to look at
what I do, see that I got away with it, and then do more of the same.
The commercial marketplacewhere messages like Bill OReillys already
liveis an important battlefield in this fight. Just because I fight
in that space doesnt mean Im making a profit from Fair Use Press. I
dont, and it certainly isnt part of the plan (I spend far more on
promotion and advertising than I take in). And my best-case scenario
for The God Who Wasnt There is to break even on marketing expenses
(production costs are already written off, gladly, as a loss). All of
my indie-film work and free-culture activism operates in the red,
subsidized by the Hollywood work-for-hire assignments I take that also
pay my rent. Im not, as you say, using well-meaning people to make
money. Im putting in my own money and time to the same purpose as the
people Im working side-by-side with. The fact that we earn revenue to
try to keep the project somewhat self-sustaining cannot reasonably be
termed exploitation.
 
Criticism is a good thing, Aaron, and we free-culture activists of
course do need to criticize each other where criticism is justified.
And I certainly should be held publicly accountable for anything I
publicly do. But in this case I really think youve gone overboard and
made accusations that have little merit.
 
Aaron replies:
 
Thanks for responding. I cant say Im glad to hear you dont expect to turn a profit on any of this, but it certainly allays any fears of exploitation.
 
But I feel like you missed my main point about the street team  the one I ended the article with: I just wish it felt  a little more like a cooperative community with the aim of spreading the Real News. Theres nothing wrong with telling people about music or movies you like, or even putting up posters to promote them. Where it gets creepy is when this natural enthusiasm is co-opted and channeled into a structured, top-down sort of system. Now Im not just expressing my opinions, Im following orders so I can get goodies. That fundamentally changes things.
 
Maybe an analogy will help. My mom likes telling people about interesting things Ive done. Theres nothing wrong with this  the people she talks to like knowing this stuff. But you have to admit it would be creepy if I started providing my mom with a list of my achievements and awarding her points every time she found a way to mention them. Mom begins to feel used, her friends begin to feel duped, and I look like a narcissist.
 
Theres no need to get rid of the promotion system, just scale it back a little. Provide a list of suggested actions, a forum where people can talk about what theyre doing, and then offer to mail a t-shirt or something to people who work hard.
 
You see, contrary to popular opinion  even in the free culture community, oddly enough  rewards are incredibly destructive. Study after study shows they actually demotivate people, encourage people to cheat and lie, and cause them to make stupid decisions about trade-offs. For an excellent book on the subject, see Alfie Kohns Punished By Rewards.

In as much I dont want to turn this commentary resource/forum into a religious one, I have to make a point or more. Based on this comment:
 
.explains Brian Flemming. To my surprise I found the evidence kept stacking up. The more I looked into it, the more that the facts aligned with those who said Jesus was just a legendary character. The shaky evidence and the poor reasoning were actually on the side of those who said that Jesus did exist.
 
While its not new to exploit the notion of GOD for money, politics and socio-pathetic acts, it mocks the inside of my crania what really drives people to do this, part of the questions that goes through my mind is: have these people not read their history books very well? Has anyone fought with this truly Supreme Being and won before? Mortal, finite and imperfect man questions- blindly, the immortal, infinite and perfect Man?
 
Mr Brian Flemming, with all the love of my heart, I will be truthful with you: have ever considered that one day you will close your eyes in death, as our fore fathers have done, WHAT IFWHAT IF, ALL the things youve heard about this God is just 100% true, what would you do? Are you prepared to take the worst RISK any man would ever take?
 
One day, yes ONE DAY, Brian, you will come face-to-face with this Jesus whom youve discarded and are treating as just another fabled legendary character.

^ JohnE.. Angry JohnEdont act out because your heavily conditioned reality is being attacked.  Its ok to fight for what you believe in but how about you turn your struggle within and step out of your comfort zone..Whats a matter?  Dont have enough faith to doubt?
 
Well..I find myself to highly resonate with much of what Mr.  Flemming is saying.  I understand how this movie will shake the core of Christian fundies (Im from a hardcore Seventh Day Adventist background, I can relate!)howeverif there is a God She expects us to use our will and reason to arrive at a belief which is in accordance with our knowledge.
We pass through viels of ignorance..some have learned too much to go back and believe what was once held so dear.  However, this movie should be seen in a positive light by those who are truly seeking after truth.  It offers them the freedom from Christianities darker psychologically impacting dogmas.  Basically, there are many other beautiful faiths to seek after and experience.  This movie is doubting the existence of Jesus Christ..not God.
 
What I would really like to see is a movie about the group of poeple who have designed religions since the Egyptian Era who gained the prescient eye of the heart which allowed each initiate to behave as an evolving organism supporting a trend towards higher genetic manifestations.  Our views change the world and ourselves..we must pass through these early stages..you have to crawl before you walk.  The Quantum Physics of today already sounds buddhist in nature and it is only a matter of time before science and religion find the synergy they once held before division.  What do the Sufis have up their sleaves this time around?  What do the illuminates intend next?  Perhaps Flemming is playing his part without even realizing it.

Hey John

John, has it occurred to you that the risk you speak of is a centuries old, highly refined manipulation designed to keep us in line?
 
Those who wish to control and rule the fearful masses have learnt a great deal about human nature over the centuries. Our masters are educated and sophisticated. What better way to manipulate the fearful masses than by associating the infinite punishment of hell with death, the greatest, most fearful mystery of all?
 
Its all carrot and stick, Pavlovian conditioning, refined by men and tested over many centuries. People are waking up to this and the Fundamentalists are a temporary reaction to the unstoppable tide of enlightenment.

The God Who Wasnt there was a BAD documentary with some nice old-school footage though ;)
It is always sad to see a person take a stubborn crusade seriously, against something he got screwed up about as a kid.
 
This revenge smells through the whole time of the movie, just getting worse towards the end. 
All the questions were thrown in the air, but none answered. There were some really interesting points, but they got skipped in a minute. Im always up for a challenge for my faith, and this didnt challenge me anymore than the hard parts of the bible. 
Good about this was the view on american fundamental christianity whom should have a second look on their theology. On my opinion The filmmaker didnt even got the principal look stupid, but rather himself.
Interviewing some teens and regular-Joes about egyptian gods? come on- why not ask from theologians who should know about this stuff?
 
The reason why I looked at this film was because of the acclaimed graphics, and let me tell you as a graphic designer and an animator- i was disappointed. I feel sorry for this amateurish movie.
 
Blasphemy of the spirit -give me a break! ever thought to read that part within the context? If you deny the Messianity of Jesus (like the pharisees did), you deny salvation from yourself.
Just wanted to point that out because people always ask about that.
 
was the film objective?    -no
was the film entertaining? -for 5.min
was the film challenging?  -not really
was the film ethical?      -no
was there a point in this? -one mans revenge, which many will undoubptadly agree on however.
 
I constantly doubt myself, my relationships as well as my relationship with God. It is a human thing to do. If something is true it doesnt cease to exist even if we doubt. If there is a God he can take our doubts then. If not, then you doubted your illusions off. Its good for us all to doubt. 
Even our doubts;)
 
peace.

I didnt see the film but I like the idea. For quit long time I ask controversial questions even to high ranked theologians but they have no answers. Why well informed theologians didnt give the answers on this or other appropriate forum as they done about Mel Gibson film Passion of Chris? We all believe in what St Paul sell to as, that not stop anybody to doubt abot existance of Christ as is portrated by St Paul. Chistianity need coimplete new reforms. Reed the pre-christian mitology and everyone will see we have beliving for 2000 years in paganism. All what St Peter sell to as was writen for milenniums before him and Jisus Christ. Simple question to the christians: Why cross is the symbol of Christianity?

I saw the movie last night and was amazed at the gaping holes in the scholarship.  The phrase that immediately came to mind was Fundamentalist Atheist.  The passion to disprove the historical Jesus plays fast and loose with scripture and history.
 
No mention of Josephus, Pliny the Younger, or other Roman historians that document the historical person of Jesus.  You can deny the divinity of Jesus (its called Free Will), but playing fast and loose with facts to prove a point is just as bad as when Fundamentalists do it.
 
And what was with the stem cell sermon.  Athiests for Life should be really upset.

i have just recently watched the film, and was very dissappointed by it. I knew the movie was inspired by a skeptic by the title, but i didnt know to what extent. A couple times i laughed, because of how ludicrous his points were, and a couple of times i felt hurt. Till i myself realized, that this IS not the case, but yet another perception on the storys interpretation itself. It was obvious that the writer did a BIAS research, and a had a bias view. Not to say that everything he mentioned was false, and that it is wrong of him to feel that way, but i think the only thing that needed altering was his perception. It is quite obvious that he is not a spiritual person, and his understanding of it lies on an intellectual level. Plenty of times during the movie, i noticed that the things that he said, were not FAR from the truth, but his interpretation of it was twisted. Like for instance, if he did  more research, and kept an open mind, he would have probably realized that Jesus was no  more than a normal man like us. He taught perception and mind training. Taught that GOD is not a seperate being, but a MIND STATE, that we have seperated ourselves from. BEING God, lies in a mind state WITHOUT perception and the egos thought system. There was one part in the movie, where Brian points out that in the Bible, the only considered sin, that Jesus made a point to exlimate,  is to deny the Holy Spirit because it leads us to an ETERNITY of damnation. This sin, is not a sin, waiting to be judged by GOD, in order to condemn u. It is a sin we cast upon ourselves that WILL lead us to an eternity of HELL, which interpreted right, u will find out is EARTH (or the physical plain). If you deny the HOLY spirit, then you will not be able to defeat the EGOs perception, Therefore , trapping us HERE, to be reborn and die, over and over until we ascend.  Jesus is an ascended Master, just like Buddha, or Thaddeus, or other historical men and women who share similar life stories as Jesus, as Brian points out. What is the world besides product of THOUGHTS? The world IS what it is and will always remain to BE, but our perception is what projects some sort of reality. What is BLASHPEMY but a contradicting thought?  I think the movie is hurtful to young, ignorant minds , that can only ADD time, to our re-awaking. Jesus teaches through forgiveness of YOURSELF, for creating these illusions of perception, and the forgiveness of your brothers, for strengthening your illusions, shall you free yourself. The HOLY spirit is the only thing REAL in our minds, that we did not create, 
because we ARE it. So you cannot RID of it, only HIDE it.
As for Jesus returning to us again, it must be interpreted PROPERLY to understand it. I know now, that Jesus is not just going to reappear to us at ONCE. It is an individual process. WE ARE CHRIST. Yet, if we continue to neglect the holy spirits way of thinking, which was our ORIGINAL way of thinking before we created our EGO, then he will not be able to reach you. Like Jesus, Buddha reached his enlightenment through the middle way, which lies between all extreme opposites. Understanding that opposites are Incoherent, only one of them can TRULY exist. The other, created by the ego, can only be false.  Both paths that these two men took, led them to the ultimate REALITY of all things. 
Thank you Aaron for this page, because right after i saw this movie, i was driven to do something to defend the Holy spirit as you were.

people need to understand that this film, while not the best documantary on the subject, IS COMPLETELY TRUE. jesus WAS NOT real, the bible IS NOT THE WORD OF GOD, and in fact, THERE IS NO GOD. all it takes is common sense and the ability to USE YOUR BRAIN.
 
please, PLEASE, all you stubborn, ignorant, naive christians who talk about testing your faithits NOT testing your faith, it should be OPENING YOU EYES, or LEARNING THE TRUTH. i hate to say it. but christians are idiots. all of them. because they belive this rubbish. its that simple. i feel sorry for you. you are dumbasses.

i think you should watch who wrote the bible. you may be more inclined to listen, as the man presenting it is a christian himself.
 
(though i fail to understand, after learning how the bible came to be, he is still a christian?? i mean, youd think if the SOLE evidence for gods existance is proved to not be what it claims, the religion would diei guess it just shows how stubborn christians are. and how, even with the bible out the window, you all still seem to believe in what is said. i REALLY cant comprehend this. i again, reiterate, christians are stupid.)

Interesting. 
How ONE film, who wrote the bible can convince you, that I am dumb. Its also very contradicting that you REFUSE to believe in the bible, BUT you beleive in this MOVIE. Not once, did i say that the bible was a valid source of information and it should be clear that the church is an illuminati owned and controlled organization. So obviously the BIBLE has been tampered with. So Kam, mister KNOW IT ALL, your so quick to deny Jesus, and the Bible, and christians, and say it all doesnt exist. So what is your explanation for it all. I mean, what i wrote must have been interesting enough for you to read all the way to the bottom. I am not a religious person myself, nor do i beleive in religion period. The term Relgion has this thick black cloud surrounded by it, that the sound of it scares people to DEATH. All it is, is a form of some type of beleif. YOUR DENIAL OF JESUS, AND CHRISTIANITY, AND THE BIBLE, IS YOUR RELGION** Do you understand that?? OR do i need to make a movie to clarify that for you??  So you tell me, what is the truth then?? There is no God??  Thats your truth. When the TRUTH of the matter is, to everyone else who read what you wrote, and beleive in something else,  your a dumbass. But of a population of 34 billion people in this world, and millions of different beleifs, YOURS IS RIGHT, and everyone ELSE, who doesnt beleive what you beleive is a dumbass. I SEE. Yes, ur right about one thing, Christianity, along with every other religion, in its own sense , IS a crock of shit. But, KAM, if you look with your eyes, and not your mouth, you will soon see, that they are all the same in ESSENCE. Relgion doesnt have to be about GOD, or JESUS, or BUDDHA. They are all SYMBOLS. Symbols for understanding, almost like WORDS. YOUR mind is the only thing that is real. WHY DONT YOU THINK ABOUT IT for a second. Without your mind, you would be incapable of understanding what i am saying to you right now. Before you lift a finger to type, you have to THINK about it first, before you speak a single word, or move a single muscle, you have to think about it first. You mind is the only thing that has the pwer in this world to Manifest. Every single thing that exists on this PHYSICAL plain, is a manifestation of someone ELSES MIND. Without the pwer of thought, that DOES NOT COME FROM YOUR BRAIN, this world would be a DESERT LAND, with NOTHING. WHEN YOU DIE, YOUR MIND DOES NOT STOP RUNNING, your brain does, and your body does.  YOU ARE NOT YOUR BODY, YOU ARE YOUR MIND. And until you are able to realize that, during a BREATHING, PHYSICAL LIFE, and detach yourself from any PHYSICAL identification we have given ourselves, our minds will continue to be in denial of its OWN EXISTANCE. Our minds are ETERNAL, therefore SO ARE WE.  It should almost be OBVIOUS right now. And i dont need a book or movie to convince me all of the time. I CAN FEEL IT, and so CAN YOU. KAM, you might feel good about yourself with the fact that you KNOW that Jesus never existed. But with that out of the way, i know your as unsatisfied aseveryone else in this world, because with that aside, what do you REALLY KNOW???
Tell me, before your own birth, where did you come from, where are you going after you DIE, maybe someone you know in this lifetime has passed away, WHERE ARE THEY NOW??? How did you get here, WHY ARE YOU HERE?? How can you be so confidant that you know so much about whats going on around you, when you dont even really know who YOU ARE. Still feel smart?

Youve seen ONe colour of the rainbow, and believe it is the only colour that exists. I wish you luck on your journey in life, and i hope one day, if you dont find God, he finds you.

I watched this movie last night and it is quite ridiculous. It is based on a man who had bad dealings in a christian school and has denied christ for that reason. Christiananity is a religion based on faith and faith conjures hope. Being a atheist there is no hope. I would rather hope to enter a afterlife rather than make movies denying christ because of a lonely guys opinion. There is truth to all of the convictions in this movie and the quotes have been stretched out of context. This is a man who is asking all kinds of questionsbut speaking no answers. He is living off his pride and ego.  He is walking in circles and he is quite humorous to me. The existence of Jesus Christ has been proven my many secular history records. This is complete and utter rubbish that is formulated in this movie. I feel sorry for him. So lostin his head.

Hey, I thought it was a great film. Not definitive but a good introduction into the topic. I came from a Christian background myself, first Roman Catholic then Baptist. Now Id consider myself an athiest and skeptic. Im willing to believe but without tangible proof I refuse to just give up reason.
To this Fortune C character. wow I dont know if I can really comprehend the pretentious, over-pious tripped out beliefs you have. I mean you have no grounding in anything. You throw out the religious scriptures and institutions to which those beliefs first came from, then you claim they are part of some illuminati conspiracy, in make revisions and changes to whatever translation(s) of the bible you read and claim those as truth. You can think youre challenging bullies like Kam with your hippy prescriptions of faith, but its just frustrating for me to witness people like you live and announce such things.
How do you know that anything you believe is true, becuase you FEEL it? Feelings are the most unruley part of human existence and they frequently change. So do you think your beliefs are benetificial to others? Well lets let a hospital full of the mentally ill and delusional out into the streets and see how productive they are to the rest of society.
These kind of groundless beliefs have no place in real life and are contrary to nature and survival. You may not be an unright lunatic, but you are very pretentious. (maybe I am too cest la vie)
 
almost forgot, but my only complaint to the dvd is that it does come off as Flemmings revenge - around the part of where he brings up the unforgiveable sin part. It tarnishes the film, but he makes good points nonetheless.

Deb, i understand what you are saying, because you are practically repeating what i said to Kam, to Me. Im not saying that my beleifs are more solid than yours. In fact, they are on the exact same level in which they are both JUST beliefs. Im also not saying that the Bible itself is an entire illuminat conspiracy. My point, is that YES, there is HIDDEN knowledge of our existance somewhere out there, because it exists in YOU. Whatever anyone chooses to believe, i fully support, whether you choose to beleive in god or not. In reality, there is only plenty of paths to choose from in this world, BUT there is only ONE ending. However you choose to get there, depends on you. JUst like you said that you may be being a little pretentious also. At least your open to that, most people are closed minded and only beleive what They beleive. 
God bless

I read a number of these comments, especially those that claim there are Roman contemporary accounts of Jesus existance. Mentioned were both Pliny the Younger (who first wrote anything mentioning Christians a good 40 years after Jesus presumed death) and Josephus, who wrote his history mentioning Jesus around 98 CE (Jesus would have died around 30 CE and Josephus wasnt even born untiul 37 CE.) So their writings were based on hearsay at best and not on Contemporary Experience. This certainly gives Flemming a correct position.

All these notions that Christ never existed are coming about {as pedicted} not because of the evidence but because of the blindeness that is overtaking mankind.Our culture questions every basic truth.There are no longer absolutes, we dboubt everything. Historically, We dont question the exsistence of Pilot,Caesar,Rome, Mary,Buddha, or Muhammadbut Jesus, oh yeah absolute PROOF.! The Bible predicts with dead on accuracy the politcal climate just before the end see {Mat 24:4-26} {1Tim 4:1-3} {2Tim 3:1-15} {Rom 1:18-32} {2Pet 3:4}.
 
Is this all a coincidence?
 
Some FFT
   We call our year 2006 because of Him, we see miracles in His name,changed lives,observed holidays,answered prayers,all done in His nameWe are hands down the greatest Nation in world history and we call ourselves a Christian Nation}. {Look at India they worship cows} {The Islamic countrys deny Christ as the only Son}. Would any of you want to live there? {Look at Russia & China The result of Atheism}. Say what you will,but those are teh facts and we certainly have more people trying to get in the USA than out
 
There are 4 gospels about His life. All written by eyewitness accounts, which the 1st copies still exsist,and this is for someone who never exsisted? 11 of the 12 diciples {who walked with Him} died inhumane tortured deaths, seperate and alone from the others, and all they had to do was sayOK its a hoax, He never exsisted. and not one did.
 
These types of theories about Him and His credibility are based on the Gnostic gospels. All 140 written after He died by some 385-500 years. Their credibility is highly suspect to say the least. You wont find a book written during the time frame He lived that disputes His actual existence. NOT ONE!!!!!!!!
 
As for the Bible, written by several authors as opposed to one like the Quran. Hard to believe that these predicitons are luck and chance. The Old Testament predicts the Messiahs coming, His lineage, His place of birth, and His way of death {crucifixtion} BEFORE it was invented.How can that be explained? For Christ to have fulfilled all documented prophices is mathmatically 1x10 to the 40th power.
I would say it takes more faith to doubt He ever lived than to believe He did

Dear Panko Stamkoski
 
The cross is not a christian symbol rather it was used by Romans to inflict the slowest and most cruel death imaginable, Why God the father choose for His Son to endure this path read the gospel of John chapter 17. As with many symbols they stand to take the place of Jesus Christ, Who will after the dust settles on this movie be the only One left standing.

Wow, I saw the trailer to The God Who Wasnt There and I was quite amazed at how much attention this author has put into Christianity.  Its almost as if he likes Christianity, I mean would anyone spend there whole life focusing on what they hate, what kind of a life would that be.  Pretty hopeless and dark.  Or maybe he really does want the hope that Christians have only doesnt understand and it makes him frustrated, so hes looking for any rational way to come to know for himself.  Yes, I think that is what is going on for all of you.  Well, you can know God through Jesus Christ but there is only one way, a way I guaranteed you have not genuinely tried.  You have to give up all of your so called greatness, wisdom, knowledge, and learning and ADMIT THAT YOU ARE A SINNER, IN DESPERATE NEED OF GODS HELP AND TO KNOW HIM THE MAKER OF ALL THINGS AND OF YOUR LIFE.  Then you need the propitiation of Jesus sacrifice to be applied to you for your sins so that you can experience the presence of God Almighty because Jesus will have made you perfectly clean before him.  Just like a criminal that someone bails out of prison cause that person loves them.  Apart from receiving ( that is believing ) in Jesus sacrifice, no one can enter their creators presence.  Those who have humbled themselves actually experience the living God, they cant prove it but they experience it.  And what is it but the very thing that these hurting, desperate, angry people in this need and are looking forA reason to be alive, to hope; a God who loves them and has a plan for their lives.  God bless all of you.  I call you friends

Why do so many atheists hate so blindly? Ranting and raving about how we Christians are dumb and wasting our lives. So determined to dispute the existence of God and Jesus that they make documentaries based on faulty logic, come up with ridiculous theories, and write downright hateful letters like the one below.
 
The reason is simple jealousy It has been scientifically proven that religious experiences create a unique chemical reaction in the brain that can relive doubt, accelerate healing rates, and create a feeling of general euphoria. In other words, Mans brain is scientifically programed to seek out God. That is why we can live on faith alone. If you have enough faith, you can fell a divine force working in your life, and it makes you whole. I believe a large reason atheists are so angry all the time is that they are trying to take that away from us because they dont have it.
 
I also quoted the post that I am directly responding to. Mostly because I find it hiliarious that someone who is calling over half the country dumbasses misspelled the words  believe and  documentary.
 
people need to understand that this film, while not the best documantary on the subject, IS COMPLETELY TRUE. jesus WAS NOT real, the bible IS NOT THE WORD OF GOD, and in fact, THERE IS NO GOD. all it takes is common sense and the ability to USE YOUR BRAIN.
 
please, PLEASE, all you stubborn, ignorant, naive christians who talk about testing your faithits NOT testing your faith, it should be OPENING YOU EYES, or LEARNING THE TRUTH. i hate to say it. but christians are idiots. all of them. because they belive this rubbish. its that simple. i feel sorry for you. you are dumbasses.
 
this site should prove you wrong and shut you up forever. get a life. use your damn brain, why is it being wasted on you people?

Title: Getting Back On Track
 
Just how crazy am I? Well, tonight I wrote my own weblogging system. One of the silver linings of losing a server is that you get to rebuild things just the way you like.
 
Anyway, this might mean Ill start posting more. Or maybe not.
 
Either way, this site is now proudly powered by good old make.
 
(For those who are interested the code is now up but its probably not easily usable by most.)

Title: Whats Going On Here?
 
Im adding this post not through blogging software, like I normally do, but by hand, right into the webpage. It feels odd. Im doing this because a week or so ago my web server started making funny error messages and not working so well. The web server is in Chicago and I am in California so it took a day or two to get someone to check on it. The conclusion was the hard drive had been fried.
 
When the weekend ended, we sent the disk to a disk repair place. They took a look at it and a couple days later said that they couldnt do anything. The heads that normally read and write data on a hard drive by floating over the magnetized platter had crashed right into it. While the computer was giving us error messages it was also scratching away a hole in the platter. It got so thin that you could see through it.
 
This was just in one spot on the disk, though, so we tried calling the famed Drive Savers to see if they could recover the rest. They seemed to think they wouldnt have any better luck. (Please, plase, please, tell me if you know someplace to try.)
 
I hadnt backed the disk up for at least a year (in fairness, I was literally going to back it up when I found it giving off error messages) and the thought of the loss of all that data was crushing. I broke down crying and couldnt function.
 
Ive since been trying to piece things together from the old backup and the Google cache and so on, but its a painful and time-consuming process, and even without this on my hands I am extremely lacking time. Ill try my best, though.
 
Thanks to everyone for their kind words and support. If you have some files you think I might be missing, let me know. If you have some disposable income and want to help fund the purchase of a new server and perhaps the recovery of the old disk, you can make a donation.
 
Sorry for screwing up.

Title: HOWTO: Be more productive
 
Translations:  |  | 
 
With all the time you spend watching TV, he tells me, you could have written a novel by now. Its hard to disagree with the sentiment  writing a novel is undoubtedly a better use of time than watching TV  but what about the hidden assumption? Such comments imply that time is fungible  that time spent watching TV can just as easily be spent writing a novel. And sadly, thats just not the case.
 
Time has various levels of quality. If Im walking to the subway station and Ive forgotten my notebook, then its pretty hard for me to write more than a couple paragraphs. And its tough to focus when you keep getting interrupted. Theres also a mental component: sometimes I feel happy and motivated and ready to work on something, but other times I feel so sad and tired I can only watch TV.
 
If you want to be more productive then, you have to recognize this fact and deal with it. First, you have to make the best of each kind of time. And second, you have to try to make your time higher-quality.
 
Life is short (or so Im told) so why waste it doing something dumb? Its easy to start working on something because its convenient, but you should always be questioning yourself about it. Is there something more important you can work on? Why dont you do that instead? Such questions are hard to face up to (eventually, if you follow this rule, youll have to ask yourself why youre not working on the most important problem in the world) but each little step makes you more productive.
 
This isnt to say that all your time should be spent on the most important problem in the world. Mine certainly isnt (after all, Im writing this essay). But its definitely the standard against which I measure my life.
 
Another common myth is that youll get more done if you pick one problem and focus on it exclusively. I find this is hardly ever true. Just this moment for example, Im trying to fix my posture, exercise some muscles, drink some fluids, clean off my desk, IM with my brother, and write this essay. Over the course the day, Ive worked on this essay, read a book, had some food, answered some email, chatted with friends, done some shopping, worked on a couple other essays, backed up my hard drive, and organized my book list. In the past week Ive worked on several different software projects, read several different books, studied a couple different programming languages, moved some of my stuff, and so on.
 
Having a lot of different projects gives you work for different qualities of time. Plus, youll have other things to work on if you get stuck or bored (and that can give your mind time to unstick yourself).
 
It also makes you more creative. Creativity comes from applying things you learn in other fields to the field you work in. If you have a bunch of different projects going in different fields, then you have many more ideas you can apply.
 
Coming up with a bunch of different things to work on shouldnt be hard  most people have tons of stuff they want to get done. But if you try to keep it all in your head it quickly gets overwhelming. The psychic pressure of having to remember all of it can make you crazy. The solution is again simple: write it down.
 
Once you have a list of all the things you want to do, you can organize it by kind. For example, my list is programming, writing, thinking, errands, reading, listening, and watching (in that order).
 
Most major projects involve a bunch of these different tasks. Writing this, for example, involves reading about other procrastination systems, thinking up new sections of the article, cleaning up sentences, emailing people with questions, and so on, all in addition to the actual work of writing the text. Each task can go under the appropriate section, so that you can do it when you have the right kind of time.
 
Once you have this list, the problem becomes remembering to look at it. And the best way to remember to look at it is to make looking at it what you would do anyway. For example, I keep a stack of books on my desk, with the ones Im currently reading on top. When I need a book to read, I just grab the top one off the stack.
 
I do the same thing with TV/movies. Whenever I hear about a movie I should watch, I put it in a special folder on my computer. Now whenever I feel like watching TV, I just open up that folder.
 
Ive also thought about some more intrusive ways of doing this. For example, a web page that pops up with a list of articles in my to read folder whenever I try to check some weblogs. Or maybe even a window that pops up with work suggestions occasionally for me to see when Im goofing off.
 
Making the best use of the time you have can only get you so far. The much more important problem is making more higher quality time for yourself. Most peoples time is eaten up by things like school and work. Obviously if you attend one of these, you should stop. But what else can you do?
 
Pretty much everyone interesting I know has some sort of pocket notebook they carry at all times. Pen and paper is immediately useful in all kinds of circumstances  if you need to write something down for somebody, take notes on something, scratch down an idea, and so on. Ive even written whole articles in the subway.1
 
(I used to do this, but now I just carry my computerphone everywhere. It doesnt let me give people information physically, but it makes up for it by giving me something to read all the time (email) and pushing my notes straight into my email inbox, where Im forced to deal with them right away.)
 
For tasks that require serious focus, you should avoid getting interrupted. One simple way is to go somewhere interrupters cant find you. Another is to set up an agreement with the people around you: dont bother me when the door is closed or IM me if I have headphones on (and then you can ignore the IMs until youre free).
 
You dont want to overdo it. Sometimes if youre really wasting time you should be distracted. Its a much better use of time to help someone else with their problem than it is to sit and read the news. Thats why setting up specific agreements is a good idea: you can be interrupted when youre not really focusing.
 
Time when youre hungry or tired or twitchy is low-quality time. Improving it is simple: eat, sleep, and exercise. Yet I somehow manage to screw up even this. I dont like going to get food, so Ill often work right through being hungry and end up so tired out that I cant bring myself to go get food.2
 
Its tempting to say to yourself, I know Im tired but I cant take a nap  I have work to do. In fact, youll be much more productive if you do take that nap, since youll improve the quality of the days remaining time and you were going to have to sleep sometime anyway.
 
I dont really exercise much so Im probably not the best person to give advice on that bit, but I do try to work it in where I can. While Im lying down reading, I do situps. And when I need to go somewhere on foot, I run.
 
Easing mental constraints is much harder. One thing that helps is having friends who are cheerful. For example, I always find myself much more inclined to work after talking to Paul Graham or Dan Connolly  they just radiate energy. Its tempting to think that you need to get away from people and shut yourself off in your room to do any real work, but this can be so demoralizing that its actually less efficient.
 
Even if your friends arent cheerful, just working on a hard problem with someone else makes it much easier. For one thing, the mental weight gets spread across both people. For another, having someone else there forces you to work instead of getting distracted.
 
But all of this is sort of dodging the issue. The real productivity problem people have is procrastination. Its something of a dirty little secret, but everyone procrastinates  severely. Its not just you. But that doesnt mean you shouldnt try to stop it.
 
What is procrastination? To the outside observer, it looks like youre just doing something fun (like playing a game or reading the news) instead of doing your actual work. (This usually causes the outside observer to think youre lazy and bad.) But the real question is: whats going on inside your head?
 
Ive spent a bunch of time trying to explore this and the best way I can describe it is that your brain puts up a sort of mental force field around a task. Ever play with two magnets? If you orient the magnets properly and try to push them towards each other, theyll repel fiercely. As you move them around, you can sort of feel out the edges of the magnetic field. And as you try to bring the magnets together, the field will push you back or off in another direction.
 
The mental block seems to work in the same way. Its not particularly solid or visible, but you can sort of feel it around the edges. And the more you try to go towards it the more it pushes you away. And so, not surprisingly, you end up going in another direction.3
 
And just as you cant get two repelling magnets to sit together just by pushing real hard  theyll fling back as soon as you stop pushing  Ive never been able to overcome this mental force field through sheer willpower. Instead, you have to be sneaky about it  you have to rotate a magnet.
 
So what causes the mental force field? There appear to be two major factors: whether the task is hard and whether its assigned.
 
The first kind of hard problem is the problem thats too big. Say you want to build a recipe organizing program. Nobody can really just sit down and build a recipe organizer. Thats a goal, not a task. A task is a specific concrete step you can take towards your goal. A good first task might be something like draw a mockup of the screen that displays a recipe. Now thats something you can do.4
 
And when you do that, the next steps become clearer. You have to decide what a recipe consists of, what kind of search features are needed, how to structure the recipe database, and so on. You build up a momentum, each task leading to the next. And as your brain gets crunching on the subject, it becomes easier to solve that subjects problems.
 
For each of my big projects, I think of all the tasks I can do next for them and add them to my categorized todo list (see above). And when I stop working on something, I add its next possible tasks to the todo list.
 
Another kind of hard problem is the one thats too complicated or audacious. Writing a book seems daunting, so start by doing an essay. If an essay is too much, start by writing a paragraph summary. The important thing is to have something done right away.
 
Once you have something, you can judge it more accurately and understand the problem better. Its also much easier to improve something that already exists than to work at a blank page. If your paragraph goes well, then maybe it can grow into an essay and then into a book, little by little, a perfectly reasonable piece of writing all the way through..
 
Often the key to solving a hard problem will be getting some piece of inspiration. If you dont know much about the field, you should obviously start by researching it  see how other people did things, get a sense of the terrain. Sit and try and understand the field fully. Do some smaller problems to see if you have a handle on it.
 
Assigned problems are problems youre told to work on. Numerous psychology experiments have found that when you try to incentivize people to do something, theyre less likely to do it and do a worse job. External incentives, like rewards and punishments, kills what psychologists call your intrinsic motivation  your natural interest in the problem. (This is one of the most thoroughly replicated findings of social psychology  over 70 studies have found that rewards undermine interest in the task.)5 Peoples heads seem to have a deep avoidance of being told what to do.6
 
The weird thing is that this phenomenon isnt just limited to other people  it even happens when you try to tell yourself what to do! If you say to yourself, I should really work on X, thats the most important thing to do right now then all of the sudden X becomes the toughest thing in the world to make yourself work on. But as soon as Y becomes the most important thing, the exact same X becomes much easier.
 
This presents a rather obvious solution: if you want to work on X, tell yourself to do Y. Unfortunately, its sort of difficult to trick yourself intentionally, because you know youre doing it.7 So youve got to be sneaky about it.
 
One way is to get someone else to assign something to you. The most famous instance of this is grad students who are required to write a dissertation, a monumentally difficult task that they need to do to graduate. And so, to avoid doing this, grad students end up doing all sorts of other hard stuff.
 
The task has to both seem important (you have to do this to graduate!) and big (hundreds of pages of your best work!) but not actually be so important that putting it off is going to be a disaster.
 
Its very tempting to say alright, I need to put all this aside, hunker down and finish this essay. Even worse is to try to bribe yourself into doing something, like saying alright, if I just finish this essay then Ill go and eat some candy. But the absolute worst of all is to get someone else to try to force you to do something.
 
All of these are very tempting  Ive done them all myself  but theyre completely counterproductive. In all three cases, youve basically assigned yourself a task. Now your brain is going to do everything it can to escape it.
 
Hard work isnt supposed to be pleasant, were told. But in fact its probably the most enjoyable thing I do. Not only does a tough problem completely absorb you while youre trying to solve it, but afterwards you feel wonderful having accomplished something so serious.
 
So the secret to getting yourself to do something is not to convince yourself you have to do it, but to convince yourself that its fun. And if it isnt, then you need to make it fun.
 
I first got serious about this when I had to write essays for college. Writing essays isnt a particularly hard task, but it sure is assigned. Who would voluntarily write a couple pages connecting the observations of two random books? So I started making the essays into my own little jokes. For one, I decided to write each paragraph in its own little style, trying my best to imitate various forms of speech. (This had the added benefit of padding things out.)8
 
Another way to make things more fun is to solve the meta-problem. Instead of building a web application, try building a web application framework with this as the example app. Not only will the task be more enjoyable, but the result will probably be more useful.
 
There are a lot of myths about productivity  that time is fungible, that focusing is good, that bribing yourself is effective, that hard work is unpleasant, that procrastinating is unnatural  but they all have a common theme: a conception of real work as something that goes against your natural inclinations.
 
And for most people, in most jobs, this may be the case. Theres no reason you should be inclined to write boring essays or file pointless memos. And if society is going to force you to do so anyway, then you need to learn to shut out the voices in your head telling you to stop.
 
But if youre trying to do something worthwhile and creative, then shutting down your brain is entirely the wrong way to go. The real secret to productivity is the reverse: to listen to your body. To eat when youre hungry, to sleep when youre tired, to take a break when youre bored, to work on projects that seem fun and interesting.
 
It seems all too simple. It doesnt involve any fancy acronyms or self-determination or personal testimonials from successful businessmen. It almost seems like common sense. But societys conception of work has pushed us in the opposite direction. If we want to be more productive, all we need to do is turn around.
 
If you want to learn more about the pscyhology of motivation, there is nothing better than Alfie Kohn. Hes written many articles on the subject and an entire book, Punished by Rewards, which I highly recommend.
 
I hope to address how to quit school in a future essay, but you should really just go out and pick up The Teenage Liberation Handbook. If youre a computer person, one way to quit your job is by applying for funding from Y Combinator. Meanwhile, Mickey Zs book The Murdering of My Years features artists and activists describing how they manage to make ends meet while still doing what they want.
 
Believe it or not, I actually have written in subways. Its easy to come up with excuses as to why youre not actually working  you dont have enough time before your next appointment, people are making noise downstairs, etc.  but I find that when the inspiration strikes me, I can actually write stuff down on a subway car, where its absurdly loud and I only have a couple minutes before I have to get out and start walking.
 
The same problem exists for sleep. Theres nothing worse than being too tired to go to bed  you just feel like a zombie.
 
Now it turns out I experience this same phenomenon in another area: shyness. I often dont want to call a stranger up on the phone or go talk to someone at a party and I have the exact same mental field pushing me off in some other direction. I suspect this might be because shyness is also a trait that results from a problematic childhood. (See Assigned problems.) Of course, this is all very speculative.
 
While the terminology I use here (next concrete step) is derived from David Allens Getting Things Done, a lot of the principles here are (perhaps even unconsciously) applied in Extreme Programming (XP). Extreme Programming is presented as this system for keeping programs organized, but I find that a lot of it is actually good advice for avoid procrastination.
 
For example, pair programming automatically spreads the mental weight of the task across two people as well as giving people something useful to do during lower-quality time. Breaking a project down into concrete steps is another key part of XP, as is getting something that works done right away and improving on it (Simplify it infra). And these are just the things that arent programming-specific.
 
For a fantastic overview of the literature, see Alfie Kohn, Punished By Rewards. This specific claim is drawn from his article Challenging Behaviorist Dogma: Myths About Money and Motivation.
 
I originally simply assumed this was somehow biological, but Paul Graham pointed out its more likely learned. When youre little, your parents try their best to manipulate you. They say do your homework and your mind tries to wriggle free and think about something else. Soon enough the wriggling becomes habit. Either way, its going to be a tough problem to fix. Ive given up trying to change this; now I try to work around it.
 
Richard Feynman tells a story about how he was trying to explore his own dreams, much the way Ive tried to explore my own procrastination. Each night, hed try to observe what happened to himself as he fell asleep:
 
Im dreaming one night as usual, making observations,  and then I realize Ive been sleeping with the back of my head against a brass rod. I put my hand behind my head and I feel that the back of my head is soft. I think, Aha! Thats why Ive been able to make all these observations in my dreams: the brass rod has disturbed my visual cortex. All I have to do is sleep with a brass rod under my head and I can make these observations any time I want. So I think Ill stop making observations on this one and go into deeper sleep.
 
When I woke up later, there was no brass rod, nor was the back of my head soft. Somehow  my brain had invented false reasons as to why I shouldnt [observe my dreams] any more. (Surely Youre Joking, Mr. Feynman!, 50)
 
Your brain is a lot more powerful than you are.
 
So, for example, instead of writing By contrast, Riis doesnt quote many people., I wrote: Riis, however, whether because of a personal deficit in the skill-based capacity required for collecting aurally-transmitted person-centered contemporaneous ethnographies into published paper-based informative accounts or simply a lack of preference for the reportage of community-located informational correspondents, demonstrates a total failure in producing a comparable result.
 
The professor, apparently seriously desensitized to bad writing, never seemed to realize I was joking (despite going over the paper with me one-on-one!).

Thanks for this nice article. I find it helpful; however, I do not agree with this statement:
 
Even worse is to try to bribe yourself into doing something
 
Personnally, I found bribing myself effective. I would find something purely entertaining that I really wanted to do but never managed to do, because I tend to procrastine about leisure as much as about work.
 
Then Id promise myself to do it in exchange for a very small task in a short time frame. This always ended up in 1) my completing the task then working some more, 2) my enjoyment of the entertaining thing, but with the desire to go back to work always on the back of my head.
 
Of course thats just me, and Ive read no studies about that, but I dont think you should dismiss the idea so easily.

Its amazing the things people will do to themselves in order to avoid sleeping when they are tired.  People would rather sit half awake in their cubes through half of the afternoon than take a 20 minute nap.  At my old job I caught a lot of flack for sneaking out to my car at lunch for a brief snooze even though it made me much more productive.

What a great distinction - highly creative work, like programming, requires you to listen to your body while uncreative work requires you to ignore it.
 
Thats a great point!

For me, one of the biggest contributors to the repellant force field around a task is that there is a component I dont know how to do.  This is made worse by the fact that I have not identified this obstacle; it has only created a wall of anxiety surrounding the task.
 
The key here is to identify that component (bring it into awareness), and decide the best way to proceed with it.  Sometimes all I need is a piece of information, and all I need to do is think about where I might find it.
 
Example:
 
Task = File village income tax form.
 
Obstacle = I dont have this form and dont know where to get it.
 
Possible solutions:  Call the village office; search the village website; ask someone who has lived in the village longer than I have; ask my accountant.
 
This is a simplistic example, but I find that even in complex projects, once the obstacle has been identified and made explicit, its usually pretty easy to brainstorm a solution.

I may be atypical, but for me the first three pieces of advice (Choose good problems, Have a bunch of them, and Make a list), which ive heard frequently given, and which i already try to do, are the source of much suffering and probably a dramatic loss of productivity.
 
Why waste life doing something dumb?  I ask myself this question all the time, and it destroys my motivation to do whatever i am doing  because no matter what i do, it is easy to think of a dozen other things that are more important (for some definition of important).  In order to  produce anything, i must constantly fight the urge to abandon what i am doing to start something more important.
 
Have a bunch of them.  Yup, i have way too many problems in my head.  I probably see three or four problems every day that i desperately want to solve.  Shutting them out is the real challenge.
 
Make a list.  Yup, i have hundreds of things to do on my list.  When i look at the list, it can be agonizing  i recall all the projects i have abandoned, or projects i really should be doing but arent, and think about how much stuff i wont have time to get done before i die.
 
Im not saying the advice is bad; its just that i have trouble, personally, when i start thinking along these lines.

Good article, thanks for writing it :) I agree with the majority of what youve written, particularly regarding the quality of time.
 
On the subject of rewards however I do find that bribing myself with rewards is often the only way I can get through really dull work. True, a lot of work is great in and of itself because it is a challenge to be solved, but there are things in every line of work which are just tedious and theres no possible way (that Ive found anyway) to make them fun.
 
For those kind of tasks I find that using a task sheet and giving myself a set amount of time to work on the task without being interrupted works well, with the added carrot on a stick at the end, eg - I have to work on these mind-numbing code corrections for one hour, and then I can go get a coffee and finish reading an article or answer some personal emails. I find this also provides much needed brain down-time, which also lets me work harder on the boring task.
 
I use the charts from http://www.to-done.com/2005/10/butterfly-stroke-productivity/ for my boring stuff, and Ive also found them useful for creative work at home too if Im feeling a bit unmotivated, eg - if I want to write music but Im scared I wont be able to get into it, I set myself a 3 hour task sheet (no reward necessary for the creative stuff) and I stick with it until the 3 hours are up because by then Ive nearly always gotten into the flow of the creative work and improved my time from being normal time to creative time.
 
Hope that makes sense. Thanks again :)

Most of the time breaking up hard tasks makes them easier to accomplish, but sometimes stepwise refinement leads to misleading conclusions.  And then there is the whole complexity theory business
One problem with wasting time writing useless memos is that at the time we often dont realize theyre useless.
Productivity improvements are all well and good, but its easy to entangle getting more done in less time with getting better things done.  Your time fungibility rebuttal is relevant here.  See Coveys book First things first where he makes these distinctions and helps us define those better things.

I believe its easier to become a top performer when youve always been pushed to reach excellence by your family

My struggle with procrastination is very similar to what is described here.  I think a lot of it boils down to a feeling of inadequacy (as someone mentioned in the comments above).  Allowing yourself the freedom to fail is very liberating.

Aaron, excellent article, although my first thought was: Why do I read it anyway? I mean, Im familiar with all the issues you point out in your article. It all seems so obvious: make a list of all the tasks you are supposed to do, avoid being interrupted, take a break when you are tired, etc., etc. But then I realized that I actually dont apply all these useful rules in my everyday life! Why dont I start working by writing down a list of assignments? Why do I study for my exams for 12 hours day after day, even though Im dead tired? Why do I always put aside all the problems which seem too difficult to deal with, instead of coping with them at once?

Hi,
 
Your article is awesome; Im really moved and inspired by everything written in the article.  I can see my productivity at different lever if I really can follow everything in this article.  One thing that I really liked in your article is interruptions.  I saw how many interruptions I tolerate, in fact every 5 minutes Ive recreated a structure that I get interrupted either from phone call or from IM or from email or from people around me.  I cant believe that Ive been wasting so much of my time tolerating my in effectiveness.  You article has given me lot of insights thanks for submitting it.

I like your advice here a great deal, but I must disagree with one of your initial assumptions, that being that watching television is a waste of time.  Of course, you go back and argue that the time you spend watching tv isnt necessarily wasted, so Im not exactly taking you to task, but I did want to offer a slightly different perspective.  Two thousand years ago, Plato was writing during the period in which writing was being invented.  Consider what it would mean to live when writing was first coming into use and how you might view it as a technological advance.  Plato had mixed feelings about it, but he often derided it as the refuge of the lazy.  In his mind, writing allowed people to keep records, which ultimately meant that they didnt have to remember.  Arguments didnt have to be worked out internally but could be set down and worked out on paper.  The point Im getting at is that all technology has met with skepticism.  And those of the past will deride it by saying it will make us lazy.  Without question these new technologies WILL change the way we behave.  But 2000 years from now, people may be hanging on to old Seinfeld episodes as classical literature and arguing that the newest gadget is rotting kids minds.

I love the idea of solving the meta problem. It makes it possible to contextualize what seems like busy work as part of a greater project (or even life work). Im not sure how I stumbled on this essay, but its still totally relevant and useful in 2011. Thanks!

You make the assertion  that time spent watching TV can just as easily be spent writing a novel. And sadly, thats just not the case.
 
Actually, you should have listened to the person who told you that, because its true. You can easily spend that time writing a novel, and nanowrimo.org helps thousands of people realize that fact every year.

Title: What Happens at the End of Infinite Jest? (or, the Infinite Jest ending explained)
 
Herb: Is there no ending to Infinite Book because there couldnt be? Or
  did you just get tired of writing it?
 
DFW: There is an ending as far as Im concerned. Certain kind of parallel lines are supposed to start converging in such a way that an end can be projected by the reader somewhere beyond the right frame. If no such convergence or projection occurred to you, then the books failed for you.
 
(Live Online with David Foster Wallace, May 17, 1996)
 
WARNING: This whole thing is one gigantic spoiler. Only read it if youve already tried to figure it out for yourself first.
 
Gately, having relived his bottom, begins to recover from his infection.
 
But at the same time, Hals condition deepens. Ever since Hal ate the mold as a child, hes been a brilliant communicator but unable to feel. (694: Hal himself hasnt had a bona fide intensity-of-interior-life-type emotion since he was tiny  in fact hes far more robotic than John Wayne.) JOI was the only one who could see it. In life, everyone thought JOI was just being crazy but in death (as a wraith) he can actually read Hals thoughts and thus confirm his view.
 
In life he created the Entertainment to draw Hal out (Hal moves outwardly but doesnt feel inside; victims of the Entertainment feelsomethinginside but dont move outwardly). After all, as he tells Gately, he was willing to resort to desperate measures: No! No! Any conversation or interchange [between father and son] is better than none at all. (839)
 
JOIs wraith is responsible for the strange disturbances around ETA  tripods in the forest, moving Orthos bed, ceiling tiles on the floor. He knocks the ceiling tiles down in an attempt to find the DMZ. Pemulis is too distracted with getting expelled to have Hal take it, so JOI needs to get it to Hal some other way.
 
JOI also created DMZ as part of an attempt to undo the effects of Hals eating mold as a child (recall: DMZ is a mold that grows on a mold). He left it along with the Entertainment (recall: ETA kids find JOIs personal effects (670: a bulky old doorless microwavea load of old TP cartridgesmostly unlabelled); the tapes and the DMZ are delivered together to the FLQ) which is about this goal (it stars a woman named Madame Psychosis (a street name for DMZ) explaining that the thing that killed you in your last life will give birth to you in the next). The DMZ and the Entertainment were meant to go together for Hal. Now that the Entertainment has escaped, he needs to get Hal the DMZ.
 
Hal never leaves leaves his toothbrush unattended (870), but thats no problem for a wraith. He places the DMZ on Hals brush and Hal brushes his teeth (860) and immediately begins experiencing symptoms: Ortho thinks Hals crying when Hal thinks hes speaking in a neutral tone (862).
 
Hals symptoms indeed begin to reverse: he is now unable to properly communicate feelings (people see him as either laughing hysterically or terribly sad) but beginning to actually feel (like Gately, he spends a lot of time lying on the floor thinking about the past  the hero of nonaction from his essay (142)). While before, everyone could hear him except JOI; now only JOI can hear him (since, as with Gately, he can hear Hals thoughts).
 
By the time of the match, his symptoms are so bad hes taken by ambulance to the hospital (16: the only other emergency room I have ever been in [was] almost exactly one year back), safely escaping the A.F.R.s assault. Like fellow student Otis P. Lord, he gets the bed next to Gately. Joelle (who is at the hospital for a meeting) visits Gately on her way out and recognizes Hal. She tells them both about the hunt for the lethal Entertainment and the resulting Continental Emergency and they all go to dig up JOIs grave. They persuade John Wayne, a spy for the A.F.R., to become a double agent and help sneak them into JOIs Quebec burial site. Wayne presumably tells the A.F.R. he is actually a triple agent  that he will steal the tape as soon as Hal digs it up. But, as with Marathe, his loyalties are ultimately even-numbered (n40). The A.F.R. finds out and brutally murders him, which is why he cant win the WhataBurger (16f).
 
As Gately forsees:
 
hes with a very sad kid and theyre in a graveyard digging some dead guys head up and its really important, like Continental-Emergency important, and Gatelys the best digger but hes wicked hungry, like irresistibly hungry, and hes eating with both hands out of huge economy-size bags of corporate snacks so he cant really dig, while it gets later and later and the sad kid is trying to scream at Gately that the important thing was buried in the guys head and to divert the Continental Emergency to start digging the guys head up before its too late, but the kid moves his mouth but nothing comes out, and Joelle van D. appears  while the sad kid holds something terrible up by the hair and makes the face of somebody shouting in panic: Too Late. (934)
 
Its too late because someone got there first and took the anti-Entertainment cartridge (126) embedded in JOIs head (31). Whoever took it is presumably the person whos made and mailed the extant copies. It couldnt be the A.F.R. or O.U.S. or they wouldnt still be searching for it. It probably wasnt the F.L.Q. because they didnt know how to read master cartridgesthey just thought they were blank tapes in their displays were blank. (483n205) It couldnt be Avril acting alone; she has problems but shes not that kind of cold-blooded killer. It had to have been Orin.1
 
Orin (who never attended his fathers funeral) went to the gravesite and dug up his father, releasing the wraith in the process. (244: After a burial, rural Papineau-region Qubecers purportedly drill a small hole down from ground level all the way down through the lid of the coffin, to let out the soul, if it wants out.) Orin, who is such a partisan of his father that he feels the need to repeatedly ruin the lives of people like his mother, has been mailing the tapes to his fathers enemies in revenge: disapproving film critics in Berkeley and the medical attach (whose affair with his mother drove Himself especially wild) in Boston. Its possible hes being influenced by the wraith in these actions.
 
After the A.F.R. releases roaches into his giant glass tumbler, Orin cuts a deal with the A.F.R. and gives them the tape in return for letting him live. (Hes apparently still alive on p. 14.) The A.F.R. uses the tape to set off some sort of intracontinental conflagaration (16: some sort of ultra-mach fighter too high overhead to hear slices the sky from south to north) which apparently topples the Gentle administration (n114: [Y.G. is] the very last year of Subsidized Time).
 
As seen in Chapter 1, Hals condition deepens until he literally cant communicate at all, but no longer feels like a robot anymore. (12: Im not a machine. I feel and believe.) The only thing he has left is tennis and he looks forward to playing Ortho Stice in the final match of the WhataBurger. But Stice is possessed by his father (in the manuscript, Stice is called the Wraithster), so the novel ends as Hal finally gets to really interface with his father  in the only way he has left.
 
Thanks to Jeff Halley and Joe Giacona for help with the part about the DMZ.
 
Recall that the padded mailer [received by the attach] is postmarked suburban Phoenix area in Arizona U.S.A. (36) Also, Orin mentions being in line in the post office even though, as Hal points out, You hate snail-mail. And you quit mailing the Moms the pseudo-form-replies two years ago. (244) Orin doesnt reply to that.
 
And: There was reason to think M. DuPlessis had received his original copies from this relative, an athlete.  [He] may have borne responsibility for the razzles and dazzles of Berkeley and Boston, U.S.A. (723) The other appearances of the Entertainment are New Iberia LA (Orin played football in New Orleans LA) and Tempe AZ (Orin lives in Phoenix AZ). (Thanks to Greg Carlisle, p. 477, for catching these.)

Well said and eminently plausible.  Someone else pointed out that Stices connection to objects moving strangely includes his match with Hal, but Ive never considered that Ortho could be somehow a conduit or connection to Himself.
 
One small correction - Orin is not drafted by the NFL after YDAU.  He has already been in the NFL for at least two seasons, in New Orleans and Phoenix.  The mention of Orin on p.14 just confirms that he survives into the Year of Glad.

Alas, Hal is in Arizona and Gately in Massachusetts at the time of their hospitalizations, so the meet-up around which this theory pivots doesnt happen. Its still plausible that Gately and Hal meet up after the Whataburger, of course, but youll need to shift your timeline a little.

Daryl, what makes you think Hals first hospitalization was in AZ?  He narrates: At the only other emergency room I have ever been in, almost exactly one year back, the psychiatric stretcher was wheeled in and then parked beside the waiting-room chairs.
 
Nothing about it being in AZ, and in fact he implies that it was not the same emergency room.

BTW, one thread thats building near the end of the book that you dont mention involves law enforcement.  Namely, the ADA who has staked out Gatelys hospital room, and the Middlesex County Sheriffs car seen in front of Ennet House in Joelles very last scene in the book.  Perhaps this doesnt interfere much with your projected ending, but I do wonder if Wallace had them in mind playing a larger role.

Yeah but Hal gets put in the room with Gately who then does what, rises from his deathbed with one arm and goes into the concavity kicking ass and taking names? Clearly Gately dies of an infection at the end so it could be his ghost who is accompanying Hal to dig up the master.

i have a few questions. hopefully this is still being viewed/updated.
 
does Gately die? Does he survive the infection or is it his ghost that helps dig up Himself with Hal? I feel that he ends up taking the meds and may or may not become addicted again Gatelys the best digger but hes wicked hungry, like irresistibly hungry (934). Briefly after in the novel he talks about his addiction to the pain meds earlier in his life and talks about how hungry for sweets he and his fellow addicts are.
 
whos the figure on 867 sitting in the bleachers getting buried by snow?

1) Gately recovers. See:
From the Year of Glad: I think of John N.R. Wayne, who would have won this years WhataBurger, standing watch in a mask as Donald Gately and I dig up my fathers head. (16-17)
 
Also, my little contribution about Lyle:
B. Loach, even w/o an official B.A., being given an Asst. Trainers job at E.T.A., a job he was promoted from just months later when the then-Head Trainer suffered the terrible accident that resulted in all locks being taken off E.T.A. saunas doors and the saunas maximum temperature being hard-wired down to no more than 50C.
(971)
 
Lyle is the ex-Head Trainer who died horribly in the sauna and now haunts the ETA grounds, helping anyone who is willing to give him a taste of their sweat (envision a parched man at sea)

I think this reading gets really close but I think there is more going on with the DMZ/Entertainment relationship.
 
I dont know how to lay this out in a straightforward way so Ill just put the whole jumble out there.
 
The kids find a bag of cartridges next to a doorless microwave while on a tunnel clean up.
 
Ennet House staff are known to rummage through the trash at ETA.
 
The FLQ shop buys the cartridges and DMZ pills together as part of the same package from some raggedy character.
 
These three facts together imply that the DMZ and master copies of the entertainment were trashed together with several doses of DMZ at ETA maybe along with other personal effects of JOI.
 
ok next thing to consider:
 
The entertainments them was how the woman who murdered you in your last life will give birth to you in your next life.
 
The mother in the entertainment was played by Madame Pyschosis.
 
DMZs street name is also madame psychosis.
 
DMZ was synthesized by chemically altering the mold that Hal ate as a child.
 
Something similar to DMZ thus murdered a part hal.
 
This fact supports Warfs hypothesis that the entertainment was intended to counteract the effects of the mold.
 
Since JOI must have viewed the film in order to edit it, make copies etc.  he must have had some means of making himself immune to the films effects.
 
JOI had in possession copies of the film and several doses of DMZ.
 
When taken together these two facts suggest that DMZ might counteract the effects of the film.
 
Alternatively, JOI may have simulated Hals condition by taking DMZ then determining how effective his entertainments were at reversing the effects of the drug.
 
DMZ is synthesized from a mold that grows on mold not an extract from the mold.
 
LSD is synthesized from a chemical in the fungus ergot.
 
The chemical modifications of the natural ergot chemical makes the chemical much more potent and psychoactive.
 
DMZ is likely much more psychoactive than the chemicals in the mold.
 
Thus DMZ is likely to have more profound side effects than the natural mold.  Hal ate the natural mold so his side effects would be less severe than a DMZ user.
 
JOI made the entertainment strong enough to counteract the effects of DMZ.
 
DMZs effects are much stronger than the mold
that hal ate.
 
Thus JOI probably realized that the entertainment would be overkill as a treatment for Hals mold related side effects.
 
Joi probably realized that the entertainment would drive Hal insane, and this is why JOI never showed Hal the entertainment.
 
JOIs constant use of mild altering substances and entertainments could have precipitated his suicide (Although I wonder if JOIs death was suicide given all of the rampant Hamlet allusions and the relationship between CT and AI).
 
With this view of the DMZ/Entertainment relationship in mind consider the following scenario of what may have prompted Hals breakdown.
 
JOIs wraith help Ortho improve his game.  This leads to Ortho almost beating Hal.  This puts Hal in an extremely stressful state.  Maybe JOI hopes this will get Hal to feel something.
 
Even after his near defeat by Ortho, Hal still doesnt seem to change. He just chalks his near failure up to Marijuana withdrawl. He even strongly considers taking Pemulis DMZ.
 
Since this is the exact opposite of what JOI wants he steals the DMZ and invents a new entertainment that is weaker than the IJ cartridge but still strong enough to make Hal have an interior life.
 
We know that the wraithe can stick things to walls.  I think he sticks Orthos face to the glass so that Hal can find him.  Hals unconscious and uncontrollable grin that is noticed by the janitors shows that he finds his fathers new entertainment very, though not fatally, amusing.
 
I think it is likely that the effects of Stices stretching face account for Hals symptoms in the first section of the book.  When Hal is lying on the floor and looking at his cup he has a hard time remembering the word to describe the opening in the cup looking smaller from his point of view.  I think it could be the case that this just got worse and worse for a while.
 
For what its worth I also think that there is evidence that JOI created posthumous entertainments.  In the description of his funeral Hal talks about how a bird poops on CT and then a fly enters his mouth.

Perfect. Exactly what I concluded. Plus a few things I hadnt thought of but sound exactly right.
 
Joelle is of course the link between Hal and Gately. I have been reading and reading trying to find someone else who thought that.
 
Which is nice because she is one of the few remotely real and likable female characters, Pat M. and Kate Gompert being the other two.
 
Thanks.

By far the most carefully considered and thorough accounts Ive come acrossthanks!  But Im hoping somebody can help flesh out the connection made here between the anti-Entertainment (126) and whatever it is JOI has put into his head (31)  the description of the latter seems to connect more obviously with JOIs erection anxiety (mentioned elsewhere a few times), and if the priapistic entertainment cartridge and mis-en-scene appropriation card, etc., dont suggest pornography specifically, they otherwise and at least sound sort of like gibberish.  And if anything, wouldnt it be the master that JOI puts in his head to begin with?

I am stuck on the fact that JOI blew up his head in a microwave and yet Hal remembers digging up his fathers head. Keeping in mind that many recollections by many characters throughout the book are intentionally or unintentionally dubious, I am not sure how to treat this statement by Hal (the only two references to this event are during the opening scene in which Hal is apparently on the verge of some kind of total mental breakdown, and during one of Dons fever dreams which are obviously a mix of real and imagined/subconscious-slipscreen stuff, as well a mix of past, present and future stuff). In short: what business does JOIs head have showing up after his suicide at all?

To some of the above questions regarding who is at the stadium that night Ortho is stuck to the window (867), I was thinking it might be Lenz. When we last see lenz, he is in a bright jacket, and sombrero (maybe?), and Hal says regarding the figure on court as wearing what seemed puffy and bright enough to be a coat. I also wonder if it could have been Poor Tony, who as mentioned once before, had been used in a Quebecois scheme earlier where he gained his bright coat.
 
This makes sense Lenz and Poor Tonys characters both exited relatively early, 100s of pages before the end, and are not mentioned again.
 
It does however refer to how the person was sitting, leaning back with its elbows on one level and and feet on the next stretched out below. While a longshot, this reminds me of the girl sitting beside Steeply at the Hal - Stice match. Poutrincourt. Who is described as wearing a violetish ski capshe wore white sneakers and a Donnay Warmup of deep glowing neutron blue. (p. 674). It describes her sitting as long arms akimbo
 
My next issue is that Poutrincourt is described as a woman having mannish qualities in the interview with Steeply (~674). Could Thierry have been a disguise? Can anyone weigh in on this? Obviously she has Quebecois heritage. Steeply is intrigued repeatedly by Poutrincourts jawline, a translucent mole on it.
 
Now this is really far out, but dont quote me on this. I havent researched this at all. What is the possibility that Avril IS Poutrincourt? It would explain why Avril rarely left the school grounds. THere is the Quebecois connection,  her Quebecois life Avril would never really discuss with Orin or Hal. An observation made by another person on another forum : Random other detail that is neither here nor there, but interesting: Orins impression of Avril, note 269, page 1052, sounds awfully reminiscent of the Cult of the Endless Kiss. Maybe Avril is more involved than originally suggested?
 
Another question I have is at the end when Orin is captured, in the gian t tumbler, he says do it to her! do it to her! (972) referencing someone outside the tumbler. Another far out thought: could Avril be Mlle Luria P? Why else would Orin say this?
 
And I find it hard to believe the ghost/ spectre idea in terms of JOI. I feel like, when reading it, that the concept of there being a ghost is supposed to be questioned. Perhaps, I mean lets just entertain the notion, that JOI isnt dead I know its hard but it explains the things being moved at ETA, how Don Gately saw JOI, and it reduces this kind of fairy-taleish ghost story to something more PHYSICALLY possible, albeit JOI as a sort of Iago/ manipulative genius / mastermind of sorts. JOI, having somehow mastered the creation of hallucination via entertainment, could have induced some of Gatelys hallucinations. Gatelys having words placed into his brain, however, contradicts this.
 
IS it possible that the Entertainment was actually designed to save Avril, who was entertwined with the Quebecois movement of her past, and provide a sort of weapon to insure her safety?
 
Those bizarre accusations made aside, I have more straightforward questions:
 
Who is it that warned Joelle that she was in Danger at the end of the book? They are referenced as having a large head (934). THis leads me to believe it was a CT relative, or perhaps CTs mother who married Avrils father. However, CTs mother was short, as referneced (???), which is negated by the woman being called huge (934). Gately also has a huge head, which means it could possibly be Gatelys mother? I dunno. These are wild, unbacked, claims.
 
What was the police car doing at Enfield when Joelle arrived back (958)? Could it be that someone finally opened the Entertainment donated from ETA and played at the Enfield House?

Im pretty sure the wraith tells Gately that wraiths cant directly interact with physical objects, so it cant be J.O.I.s ghost directly moving objects and causing disturbances at E.T.A. However, its said that Lyle can lift an object hes sitting on, so I think it most be J.O.I.s ghost telling his old friend Lyle to telekinetically move the objects.

John Wayne would be Fils de Montcalme or FLQ, not AFR since they admit to having no one in position in ETA (hence the need to infiltrate via the Quebec Jr. team) and the description of Waynes complete control over his body (autonomic as well as voluntary nervous systems, note 382) is in line with the Eternal Kiss tradition rather than the Prochaine Train.

Title: Because We Can
 
When I first started studying the First Amendment  nearly a decade
ago; yikes, this is a very overdue blog post  I read about the
different theories trying to make sense of it. Some scholars argued
the First Amendments goal was to create a robust marketplace of
ideas: if everyone could share their opinion, the truth could come out
through robust debate. Others concluded the First Amendment was a sort
of logical safeguard: by protecting speech and assembly and petitions
for redress of grievances, it guaranteed people the right to work
against laws they disapprove of, kind of the way the Second Amendment
is said to be a bulwark against totalitarianism.
 
These arent just theoretical debates; the theories have practical
consequences for how one interprets that key amendment. If you believe
its for a marketplace of ideas, then you will support regulation
aimed at correcting market failures by suppressing certain kinds of
problematic speech. If you believe its a political safeguard, then
you will not be too worried about speech regulation aimed at clearly
nonpolitical speech.
 
Now, Im not quite sure why such a theory is needed. The First
Amendment always struck me as perfectly clear: Congress shall make no
law. No law meant no law (at least with regard to content; Im more
lenient when it comes to regulating other aspects). But if one has to
have a theory, it struck me the right one was something completely
different: Because We Can.
 
The Framers were very skeptical of government. The system they
designed was full of checks and fetters, of which the First Amendment
is probably the most extreme (unless you believe in a libertarian
conception of the Tenth). They saw government as a necessary evil;
they were willing to accept it, but they wanted to constrain it where
they could.
 
And speech is a very obvious way to constrain it. A government needs
to be able to stop violence and make war and so on or its people will
get very badly hurt. But theres no reason it has to stop speech. As
the old saying goes, sticks and stones may break my bones but words
will never hurt me. Words do hurt, of course, but theirs is a
tolerable pain. People, and society, march on even in the face of
grievous insults. And so the Framers decided to exclude this class of
regulation from the governments ambit. Not because speech is
particularly good, but because its not particularly bad. Because its
one thing they could safely exclude. Because we can.
 
The implications of this theory for interpretation are obvious: they
lead to the most expansive conception of the First Amendment
compatible with the other goals of government: a stable democratic
body to promote the general welfare, and so on. Thats certainly
further than any court heretofore has gone and probably a bit further
than Id personally prefer, but isnt that what fetters are for?

Title: Cmo contrato programadores
 
English
 
traducido por iPodizados
 
Hay tres preguntas cuando ests contratando a un programador (o a cualquier otro trabajador, para el caso): Es inteligente? Puede sacar el trabajo adelante? Puedo trabajar con l? Alguien que sea inteligente pero que no saca el trabajo adelante debera ser tu amigo, no tu empleado. Puedes hablar sobre tus problemas mientras procastinan (posponer conscientemente un trabajo que sabemos que tenemos que hacer) con su trabajo real. Alguien que saca adelante el trabajo pero que no es inteligente, es ineficiente: los que no son inteligentes sacan el trabajo adelante usando el camino ms difcil y trabajar con ellos es lento y frustran. Por ltimo, alguien con quien no puedes trabajar bueno, pues no puedes trabajar con l.
 
El proceso tradicional de contratacin de programadores consiste en: a) leer un curriculum, b) realizar algunas preguntas difciles en una conversacin telefnica, y c) darles un problema de programacin en persona. Creo que es un sistema horrible para contratar a alguien. Se puede aprender muy poco de un curriculum y la gente se pone nerviosa cuando les haces preguntas complejas en una entrevista. Programar no es el tpico trabajo que se hace bajo presin, as que ver cmo se comporta alguien cuando est nervioso es bastante intil. Y las preguntas de la entrevista que normalmente se formulan parecen escogidas simplemente para que sean crueles. Creo que soy un programador bastante bueno, pero nunca he superado una de esas entrevistas y dudo que nunca lo pueda hacer.
 
As que cuando tengo que contratar gente, intento responder a las tres preguntas [que planteaba al principio]. Para saber si pueden sacar el trabajo adelante, les pregunto qu han hecho. Si de verdad hacen su trabajo, a estas alturas deberan tener algo ya hecho. Es difcil ser buen programador sin algn tipo de experiencia previa y en estos das todo el mundo puede obtener experiencia colaborando en algn proyecto de software libre. As que les pido una muestra del cdigo y una demostracin y miro a ver si me gusta. Aprendes un montn rpidamente, porque no les ests mirando mientras responden a una compleja pregunta de entrevista, sino que ests viendo el cdigo real que han producido. Es conciso? Claro? Elegante? Usable? Es algo que querras en tu producto?
 
Para saber si alguien es inteligente, tengo una conversacin informal con ellos. Hago todo lo posible por eliminar la presin: me encuentro con la persona en un caf, les digo claramente que no es una entrevista, hago todo lo que puedo por ser informal y amigable. Bajo ningn pretexto les hago preguntas estndar de entrevista. Simplemente hablo con ellos como lo hara con alguien que conozco en una fiesta. (Si le pides a la gente que conoces en una fiesta que enumeren sus puntos fuertes y dbiles o que estimen el nmero de afinadores de piano que hay en Madrid, tienes problemas ms importantes). Creo que es bastante sencillo saber si alguien es inteligente mientras sostienes una conversacin informal con l. Constantemente hago juicios sobre si la gente que estoy conociendo es inteligente, de la misma forma que constantemente estoy evaluando si la gente que veo me parece atractiva.
 
Pero si tuviera que escribir qu es lo que hace que alguien me parezca inteligente, pondra el nfasis en tres cosas. La primera tienen conocimientos? Pregntales en qu han estado pensado y comprueba su nivel de conocimiento sobre ello. Parecen comprenderlo al detalle? Pueden explicarlo claramente? (explicaciones claras son un signo de que realmente conocen la materia). Saben cosas sobre ese tema que t no sabes?
 
Segunda, son curiosos? Responden hacindote preguntas sobre ti? Estn genuinamente interesados o simplemente estn siendo educados? Realizan preguntas sobre lo que ests diciendo? Te hacen pensar sus preguntas?
 
Tercero, Aprenden? En algn punto de la conversacin, probablemente acabars explicndole algo. Lo entienden de verdad o simplemente asienten y sonren? Hay gente que sabe cosas sobre alguna pequea rea, pero no tienen curiosidad con respecto a otras. Y hay gente que es curiosa pero no aprende, realizan muchas preguntas pero en realidad no estn escuchando. Y yo quiero alguien que cumpla las tres cosas [escuchar+preguntar+aprender].
 
Finalmente, concluyo si puedo trabajar con alguien pasando algn tiempo con esa persona. Mucha gente brillante puede parecer agradable en una conversacin de una hora, pero sus excentricidades se hacen patentes despus de un par de horas. As que, una vez que hayas acabado la charla, invtale a comer con el resto del equipo o a jugar a algo en la oficina. Por supuesto, mantengo las cosas tan informales como sea posible. El objetivo es, precisamente, ver si te ponen de los nervios.
 
Si todo parece correcto y ya me siento preparado para contratar a alguien, hago una pequea comprobacin final de seguridad para confirmar que no me la han dado con queso: les pido que hagan una parte del trabajo. Normalmente, esto supone escoger una parte del proyecto suficientemente independiente y pedir que la escriban (si realmente necesitas ver a alguien trabajando bajo presin, ponles una fecha de entrega). Si es necesario, puedes ofrecer pagarles por el trabajo, pero a la mayora de los programadores que me he encontrado no les importa que les encargues una tarea pequea como esta siempre y cuando puedan publicar el cdigo de su trabajo cuando est acabado. Esta prueba no funciona por ella misma, pero si alguien ha pasado las primeras tres partes, debera ser suficiente para probar que no te han engaado, y que realmente pueden sacar adelante el trabajo.
 
(He conocido gente que me dice Perfecto, por qu no probamos a contratarte un mes y vemos cmo sale? Esto no parece funcionar. Si no puedes hacerte una idea despus de encargarle un pequeo trabajo, tambin podra pasarte que un mes despus tampoco tuvieras una opinin clara y has acabado contratando gente que no son suficientemente buenos. Mejor decir directamente no y equivocarse por el lado de intentar conseguir a los ms indicados [que acabar con alguien que no da la talla].
 
Estoy bastante contento con este mtodo. Cuando me he saltado algunas partes, he acabado con contrataciones fallidas que finalmente he tenido que deshacer. Pero cuando las he seguido, he conseguido gente que me gusta tanto que me siento mal si tengo que dejar de trabajar con ellos.
 
Me sorprende que en vez de esta perspectiva, haya tantas empresas que utilicen unas tcnicas tan estpidas para contratar.

====================================================
Date: April 18, 2012
 
Title: y the power of exponents, just five levels of councils, each consisting of only fifty people, is enough to cover over three hundred million people.?
 
The government of a republic, James Madison wrote in Federalist No.39 (Conformity of the Plan to Republican Principles, 1788), must ?be derived from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic.?
 
Looking at our government today?a House of professional politicians, a Senate filled with multimillionaires, a string of presidential family dynasties?it seems hard to maintain that our officials are in fact ?derived from the great body of the society? and not ?a favored class? merely posing as representatives of the people.
 
Unless politics is a tradition in your family, your odds of getting elected to federal office are slim. And unless you?re a white male lawyer, you rarely get to vote for someone like yourself in a national race. Nor, in reality, do we have an opportunity to choose policy positions: no major candidates support important proposals that most voters agree with, like single-payer health care.
 
Instead, national elections have been boiled down to simple binary choices, which advertising men and public relations teams reduce to pure emotions: Fear. (A bear prowls through the woods.) Hope. (The sun rises over a hill.) Vote Smith. Or maybe Jones.
 
Nor does the major media elevate the level of debate. Instead of substantive discussions about policy proposals and their effects, they spend their time on horse-race coverage (who?s raised the most money? who?s polling well in Ohio?) and petty scandals (how much did that haircut cost? was someone somewhere offended by that remark?)
 
The result after all this dumbing down? In 2004, voters who said they chose a presidential candidate based on the candidate?s agendas, ideas, platforms, or goals comprised a whopping 10% of the electorate. So it?s not too surprising when political scientists find that voters? decisions can be explained by such random factors as whether they like red or blue, whether the economy is good or bad, or whether the current party has been in office for long or not.
 
Aside from the occasional telephone poll, the opinions of ?the great body of the society? have been edited out of the picture. Way back in Federalist No. 10 (The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection (continued), 1787), Madison put his finger on the reason. ?However small the republic may be,? he noted, ?the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few.? But similarly, ?however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude.?
 
The result is that the population grows while the number of representatives stays fixed, leaving each politician to represent more and more people. The first Congress had a House of 65 members representing 40,000 voters and three million citizens (they had a whopping 1.3% voter turnout back then). That?s a representative for around every 600 voters or 46,000 citizens (the size of the average baseball stadium). A baseball stadium may be a bit of an unruly mob, but it?s not unimaginably large.
 
Today, by contrast, we have 435 representatives and 300 million citizens?one for roughly every 700,000 citizens. There isn?t a stadium in the world big enough to hold that many people. It?s a number more akin to a television audience (it?s about how many people tune in to watch Keith Olbermann each night).
 
Which is exactly what the modern constituency has become: the TV audience following along at home. Even if you wanted to, you can?t have a real conversation with a TV audience. It is too big to convey a sense of what each individual is thinking. Instead of a group to represent, it?s a mob to be managed.
 
I agree with Madison that there is roughly a right size for a group of representatives ?on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and national objects.?
 
But what Madison missed is that there is no similar limit on the number of such groups. To take a technological analogy, the Internet is, at bottom, an enormous collection of wires. Yet nobody would ever think of it this way. Instead, we group the wires into chips and the chips into computers and the computers into networks and the networks into the Internet. And people only deal with things at each level: when the computer breaks, we can?t identify which wire failed; we take the whole thing into the shop.
 
One of the most compelling visions for rebooting democracy adopts this system of abstraction for politics. Parpolity, developed by the political scientist Stephen Shalom, would build a legislature out of a hierarchical series of nested councils. Agreeing with Madison, he says each council should be small enough that everyone can engage in face-to-face discussion but large enough that there is a diversity of opinion and the number of councils is minimized. He estimates the right size is 25 to 50 people.
 
So, to begin with, let us imagine a council of you and your 40 closest neighbors?perhaps the other people in your apartment building or on your block. You get together every so often to discuss the issues that concern you and your neighborhood. And you may vote to set policy for the area which the council covers.
 
But your council has another function: it selects one of its own to send as a representative to the next council up. There the process repeats itself: the representative from your block and its 40 closest neighbors meet every so often to discuss the political issues that concern the area. And, of course, your representative reports back to the group, gets your recommendations on difficult questions, and takes suggestions for issues to raise at the next area council meeting.
 
By the power of exponents, just five levels of councils, each consisting of only fifty people, is enough to cover over three hundred million people. But?and this is the truly clever bit?at the area council the whole process repeats itself. Just as each block council nominates a representative to the area council, each area council nominates a representative to the city council, and each city council to the state council, each state council to the national council, and so on.
 
Shalom discusses a number of further details?provisions for voting, recalls, and delegation?but it?s the idea of nesting that?s key. Under such a system, there are only four representatives who stand between you and the people setting national policy, each of whom is forced to account to their constituents in regular, small face-to-face meetings. Politicians in such a system could not be elected through empty appeals to mass emotions. Instead, they would have to sit down, face-to-face, with a council of their peers and persuade them that they are best suited to represent their interests and positions.
 
There is something rather old-fashioned about this notion of sitting down with one?s fellow citizens and rationally discussing the issues of the day. But there is also something exciting and new about it. In the same way that blogs have given everyone a chance to be a publisher, Wikipedia lets everyone be an encyclopedia author, and YouTube lets anyone be a television producer, Parpolity would let everyone be a politician.
 
The Internet has shown us that the pool of people with talent far outnumbers the few with the background, connections, and wealth to get to a place in society where they can practice their talents professionally. (It also shows us that many people with those connections aren?t particularly talented.)
 
The democratic power of the Net means you don?t need connections to succeed. In a world where kids can be television stars just by finding a video camera and an Internet connection, citizens may begin to wonder why getting into politics is so much harder.
 
For many years, politicians had a ready excuse: politics was a difficult job, which required carefully weighing and evaluating evidence and making difficult decisions. Only a select few could be trusted to perform it; the vast majority of the population was woefully underqualified.
 
And perhaps in the era of a cozy relationship between politicians and the press, this illusion could be sustained. But as netroots activists and blogs push our national conversation ever closer to the real world, this excuse is becoming laughable. After all, these men and women of supposedly sober judgment voted overwhelmingly for disasters like the Iraq War. ?No one could have ever predicted this,? TV?s talking heads all insist. No one, that is, except the great body of society, whose insistence that Iraq did not pose a threat and that an occupation would be long and brutal went ignored.
 
New online tools for interaction and collaboration have let people come together across space and time to build amazing things. As the Internet breaks down the last justifications for a professional class of politicians, it also builds up the tools for replacing them. For the most part, their efforts have so far been focused on education and entertainment, but it?s only a matter of time before they turn to politics. And when they do, professional politicians beware!
