Simple crawler that I wrote (in Python) to get all the blog entries from Aaron Swartz's weblog. (http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/). It contains all of the 449 entries.  The output was written into .txt files which I converted to .PDF. The PDF file can be downloaded. 


This program is written in haste and rather crudely. As a result, all the bugs haven't been entirely resolved. The crawler crashed at the links whose corresponding pages didn't exist. It had to be manually restarted from these points. 

Some portions of the text may have some encoding related issues too. I hope to resolve these in further updates to the code.
