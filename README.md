### In memory of Aaron Swartz ###

Python web crawler to get all the blog entries from [Aaron Swartz's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) [weblog](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/). It contains all of the 449 entries.  The output was written into .txt files which I then converted to PDF. The PDF file can be downloaded separately [here](https://github.com/rohitsm/aaronsw_RawThought/tree/master/PDF). 

![alt text](https://github.com/rohitsm/aaronsw_RawThought/blob/master/images/Aaron_Swartz.png "Aaron Swartz (1986 - 2013)")

This program was written in haste and rather crudely. As a result, all the bugs haven't been entirely resolved. The crawler crashed at the links whose corresponding pages didn't exist. It had to be manually restarted from these points. 

Some portions of the text may have some encoding related issues too. I hope to resolve these in further updates to the code. 

**UPDATE 2** 

Some of my code from this repository got featured in the 2014 documentary "The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz". I humblebragged about this [here](http://oldblog.rohitsm.com/2014/11/humblebrag-this-blog-got-featured-in.html)

**UPDATE 1** 

A detailed rationale behind this project can be found [here](http://oldblog.rohitsm.com/2013/01/remembering-aaron-swartz-raw-thought.html).
