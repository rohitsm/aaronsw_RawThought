Title: The Percentage Fallacy
 
Theres one bit of irrationality that seems like it ought to be in behavioral economics introduction but mysteriously isnt. For lack of a better term, lets call it the percentage fallacy. The idea is simple:
 
One day I find I need a blender. I see a particularly nice one at the store for $40, so I purchase it and head home. But on the way home, I see the exact same blender on sale at a different store for $20. Now I feel ripped off, so I drive back to the first store, return the blender, drive back to the second store, and buy it for $20.
 
The next day I find I need a laptop. I see a particularly nice one at the store for $2500, so I purchase it and head home. But on the way home, I see the exact same laptop for $2480. Pff, well, its only $20, I say, and continue home with the original laptop.
 
Im sure all of you have done something similar  maybe the issue wasnt having to return something, but spending more time looking for a cheaper model, or fiddling with coupons and rebates, or buying something of inferior quality. But the basic point is consistent: well do things to save 50% that wed never do to save 1%.
 
At first this almost seems rational  of course were going to do more to save more money! But you arent saving more money. With both the blender and the laptop, you have the chance to save $20. Either way, youre going to have another twenty in your pocket, which you can spend on exactly the same things later on. Yet we behave differently depending on whether we got that twenty by skimping on a small purchase or skimping on a big one. Rationally, if driving back to the store isnt worth $20 when youre buying a laptop, it isnt worth $20 when youre buying a blender.
 
On the other hand, dont those small savings tend to add up after a while? If you start blowing $20 every time you buy a trinket, youre soon going to be out of disposable income. Meanwhile, spending several thousand dollars is much rarer, so isnt it OK to slack off a bit on such occasions?
 
If we work to save 50% on everything, big or small, thats the equivalent of saving 50% of our money altogether. Whereas if we only try to save fixed amounts on every purchase, how much we save is dependent on how many things we buy.
 
So which is the real irrationality? Im not entirely sure of the answer.

This is covered in behavioural economics. For example, see Predictably Irrational (http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/006135323X/ or http://openlibrary.org/b/OL9952510M) where Dan Ariely calls it the problem of relativity using an example about pens and suits (p. 19-20).

Im not sure that the kind of person who will spend $2500 on a laptop is the same as the kind of person who would return the $40 blender.
 
Im sure there are other analogies which point out this behavior, but I dont think the blender one is realistic.

Isnt there another angle to this? Assuming that the market rate should fairly be the point of best compromise between the lowest a seller will accept and the highest a buyer is prepared to spend, its perceived as important not to support someone charging 200% of the market rate, but significantly less important that someone charging less than 1% above the market rate gets away with it. How dare they charge me $40 for a $20 blender? bears no real comparison to So they charged me $2500 for a $2480 laptop? Wooo. Again, if its a question of principle then the response in one sense should be the same - thats unfair, Im going to sort it out - but this way round, the percentage does seem to matter, whether its $20 or $2000.

I think the driving force is the need to not look/feel like an idiot. Buying something at twice the normal price leaves people with the same amount of feeling ripped off, almost regardless of the amount of money that they lost.
 
It then varies how much emphasis people put on not looking like fools vs. saving actual money.  Those whore poor probably think more about the dollars.

Maybe people dont return the laptop because buying or returning a laptop usually involves a bit more paperwork/time, since it is a big ticket item.  Also, if you accidentally drop the blender on the way into the store, youre out $40, while if you drop the laptop, youre out $2500.

I personally when doing financial computation put everything into dollars/year. In the above example, both would appear as $20, and I would act accordingly. The reasons for the year, is for comparing reoccurring bills such as cell phones. Add all the costs up, then divide it by the terms of the contract. This way, Im always comparing in like terms.

You might also consider the long term.  A 1% variation of prices between stores is to be expect, but a 50% variation is not, regardless of the price of the item.  One cant put a dollar amount on the variation of prices between goods at different stores for any arbitrary goods; if blenders vary by $20 in price in a town, its unreasonable to expect laptops or cars to vary by the same amount.
 
So if you think in macroscopic terms, we would like a strategy to execute consistently over our lifetimes, for all goods.  If we hit 5 stores on the way home, we cant keep exchanging the item every time we see a 1% variation in the price of a good.  A 50% variation, since its so uncommon, would be worth the effort, since its unlikely to be repeated.
 
I agree with your reasoning in general, Im just thinking of a possible explanation for why people behave this way.

There are hidden qualities to the place you purchase an item.  For instance, people typically find (or at least imagine) that higher-priced stores give better service, are more trustworthy, etc.  A higher quality store might be worth 10% of the purchase price.  So, if you spend $22 vs $20 on the blender, you can at least imagine its a wash.  But 100% markup is more than you can ignore.  So then you decide if the effort is worth $20.  For a laptop you might need $2750 vs $2500 before you consider whether the effort is worth the money.
 
Of course there isnt a specific cutoff, so its a bit more vague than this.  And of course higher prices dont always mean a better quality (where quality is customer service, the chance of fraud, the ability to return the item in the future, etc).

Isnt the rational thing to do to judge how long it takes to return the item against the value of your time (judged by the next-best alternative), and if you come out ahead, then to do it, regardless of percentages?
 
I try to think this way, but its hard to fight that feeling of being ripped off when you see a large percentage difference.
 
I also think that when you make a high value purchase, youre in a different thinking mode.
When Im purchasing things in the sub $50 range, Im thinking in terms of how many coffees or books Im giving up. When Im purchasing things in the 1000+ plus range, Im thinking in terms of computers or cars.
 
$20 in the first sense feels like two weeks worth of coffee. $20 in the second sense feels like just some nominal percent of a laptop, so it holds less value until I change purchasing modes.

Umm Late to the party here, but I dont get it. If we assume one buys $40 items every week, but buys $2,500 items only once or twice a year, its pretty obvious why it would be a bad idea to get into the habit of letting oneself get ripped off $20 on a $40 item - youll go broke in a hurry.
 
An analogy: Most people will splurge on (dinner, tickets) when on vacation, but not when not. Why? Because their budgets can tolerate a small deviation. But if they begin out-of-budget splurging every week of the year, their budgets will crumble.
 
Its not a fallacy at all. Its about forming good habits. Its a good habit to demand a refund on a 50% overpayment, and probably a bad habit to start haggling over 1% differences.

Title: Capital and its Complements: A Summary
 
The following is a non-technical summary of Brad DeLongs May 2008 paper Capital and Its Complements.
 
Adam Smith explained that in all countries with security of property and tolerable administration of justice citizens would spend all their money (capital), either on consumption or investment, causing the countrys economy to grow. After some contention, later economic studies tended to bare this out: a shortage of capital wasnt always the bottleneck, but when it was, removing it could lead to extraordinarily rapid growth.
 
The problem for poor countries is that, because of high mortality rates (which require more children to have some survive) and low educational levels (which mean those children can find productive employment quickly), they have high population growth and thus low capital-to-labor ratios. Worse, trade allows you to spend your money buying manufactured goods from overseas, for which you have only your very cheap labor to provide in return. The result is that it requires an enormous amount of domestic investment to improve capital-to-labor ratios.
 
And so rich country economists made the neoliberal bet on behalf of poor countries: they hoped that loosening restrictions on international capital flows would send capital rushing in to poor countries and build their economies, the same way that Great Britains massive investment in a young United States (in 1913 Britains foreign assets equaled 60% of its domestic capital stock) built up that country.
 
But what ended up happening was exactly the opposite. Yes, NAFTA led US companies to invest the $20 to $30 billion a year on manufacturing in Mexico that its boosters predicted, but that investment was more than outweighed by the $30 to $40 billion a year fleeing the country from Mexicos wealthy wanting to invest it in the United States. Why? In part because the US was more politically stable, and thus a safer investment climate. And in part because the US treats its own workers so poorly  with productivity rising 35% since 2000 while real wages remain flat  it provides an excellent investment opportunity.
 
But meanwhile, all this investment in the US was dwarfed by the Chinese acquisition of our debt (and thus the political risk it represents). China needed to do this, since US purchase of their exports is the only thing funding the manufacturing-led industrialization of a massive portion of their economy; there would be massive dislocation if that funding dried up.
 
Recognition of these facts came slowly. First, Larry Summers said it was our unsustainable current account deficit. (That was the 1990s; today that deficit is four times as large.) Later, economists thought it must have been our large budget deficits. Then they began thinking it was the run-up in housing prices. But that, it is now clear to most economists, was the result of a bubble. And yet the flow of capital to the US continues. But, perhaps even more frighteningly, it could stop at any moment.

Title: Last Goodbyes
 
Its minutes to midnight and Im hurriedly packing. Early tomorrow morning I catch a flight to Boston and start my new life. I havent really gotten much of a chance to pack until now, because Ive spent the past few days in a rush of meetings, getting in my last goodbyes for everyone I know in San Francisco.
 
Its been great seeing everyone, but like most locals, theyre all puzzled as to why Im leaving. Ive been struggling to explain why. When I say the weather, everyone just laughs. When I say San Francisco is too loud, they start arguing. When I say its the people, they tell me to find a better group of friends.
 
And the thing is, theyre right. Its none of these. Ive been spectacularly unable to articulate it, but the real answer is simpler and more prosaic. And now, after great thought and struggle, I realize the answer is simply this: Cambridge is the only place thats ever felt like home. Its that simple. And when you put it that way, its clear why I have to go.
 
So goodbye Stanford, goodbye Palo Alto; goodbye south bay, goodbye peninsula; goodbye Change Congress, goodbye Creative Commons; goodbye Mission, goodbye SOMA; goodbye friends, goodbye loved ones; goodbye San Francisco, home to everyone Ive ever loved. Youll always have my heart.

Title: Scenes
 
God, Im so sick of this stuff. Cant we just go home? she wines. Jesus, I say, would it kill you to go one more place? Its been a long hot day in strange, busy New York City, and were not exactly at our best. In fact, the combination of heat and exhaustion has turned our love bitter, brought on the darkness and recriminations. Its at moments like these, the dark depths of a relationship, that you wonder how things could ever work. As we walk down the steps we hear a subway car approach. We accelerate, running to catch it. Its doors open. Were moving faster now, pushing our way through the bustle of Manhattanites to make it. The bell sounds and I jump inside and hear the doors whoosh closed behind me. I spin around only to see her trapped on the other side of the glass. I put my hand up to it, but the train accelerates and shes left standing there, just another face in the crowd.
 
Hey, want to see the game? Want a ticket to the Giants game? I do not, in fact, want to see the game  this or any other game. I hate sports. Yet the scalpers, apparently unaware of this, insist on trying to sell me one. Thats what I get for walking near the ballpark, I guess. As I curse my choice of scenery, a cop pulls up. He lowers his window and leans out toward the scalper. The scalper hands him a ticket and the cop speeds off. But he didnt pay! a man in a suit walking by complains. Cops get a special deal, explain the scalper. The man in the suit laughs and marvels at the scene.
 
Its weird being back at Stanford in the summer. Everythings so empty, nobodys around. Well, not nobody  there seems to be some action near the main quad. There are drum kits spread around and golf carts and purple uniforms lying about. But most of all, there are people  a bunch of students just standing around awkwardly. Im about to ask one of them whats going on when a bell rings and a voice shouts Background! Suddenly all the students snap to attention, begin walking in perfect lines with bookbags slung over their shoulder, bicycles ridden in perfect formation. These arent students at all, I realize with a lurch  theyre extras. Its disconcerting. A police guard is at the side, keeping kids from running over the camera crew. I ask her what theyre filming. Disneys High School Musical, she says quickly, trying to keep a student from cycling over the directors cart.

Title: Moving On
 
In November 2006, I moved to San Francisco because I had to: my company got acquired and us moving out was a condition of the agreement. It was the first time Id ever actually lived in San Francisco, as opposed to just visiting, and I quickly realized that although it was a fun place to visit, I couldnt stand living here.
 
Even after all this time, I cant really put my finger on what it is I dont like  in fact, I suspect its probably harder for me now to explain it than it was when I first came here. The first thing that comes to mind is how loud the city is. I want a place where I can live quietly and focus on my work; but San Francisco is filled with distractions. There are always crews tearing up the street, trains that are delayed, buses that have broken down, homeless people begging, friends having parties, and so on. Its impossible to concentrate and without my concentration, I feel less like me.
 
The other big problem is that San Francisco is fairly shallow. When I go to coffee shops or restaurants I cant avoid people talking about load balancers or databases. The conversations are boring and obsessed with technical trivia, or worse, business antics. I dont see people reading books  even at the library, all the people are in line for the computer terminals or the DVD rack  and people at parties seem uninterested in intellectual conversation.
 
And so Im moving back to Cambridge, Massachusetts  Harvard Square in particular, the one place Ive ever been to that brings a special delight to my eyes, that warms my heart just to see. Surrounded by Harvard and MIT and Tufts and BC and BU and on and on its a city of thinking and of books, of quiet contemplation and peaceful concentration. And it has actual weather, with real snow and seasons and everything, not this time-stands-still sun that San Francisco insists upon.
 
I miss Boston; Im excited to go back.
 
But Im also sad to leave my responsibilities in San Francisco. One of which Id particularly like your help with. Ive been honored and overjoyed to help Lawrence Lessig get his Change Congress project off the ground. If you havent heard, hes trying to build a national movement to get the corruption out of Congress; to pass public financing of public elections, earmark reform, and other pressing concerns.
 
But they need a full-time day-to-day tech organizer. Someone who knows how to blog and who the bloggers are and can keep them in touch with the community. Someone who knows enough about technology to know the tools that can be built and should be. And someone with enough drive and talent to make sure those things get built. Its a dreamy job and I hope theres someone out there who will take it from me. A more formal write-up is on the Change Congress blog.
 
Thanks for everything.

Congrats on your move. I was just in Harvard Square a few days ago and enjoyed my short time walking around the area.
 
I will say, though, that while I was there, my ride on the T was delayed, some street musicians were playing loud Bob Dylan covers and, yes, I even witnessed some homeless people begging. I guess some things about city life are the same wherever you go.

Aaronno offense, but lighten up, man! Cities everywhere, even Cambridge, are loud and annoying and have beggars; people will always, even in Cambridge, disappoint and be lower-brow than you wish. I find aspects of San Francisco a bit tedious myself, but your analysis is superficial. Holing yourself up in an academic cocoon is just as selfish and self-enthralled as the database load balancers you mock. Cant you see the contradiction in your engagement through Change Congress and your, frankly, whiny rejectionism? And in your yearning for the real seasons of Boston while at the same time seeking some notion urban purity?

You & I established within 5 minutes of meeting that we have opposite city preferences. You were interested in Philly and I hated every minute there, and I even hated the parts that you liked. Im happily in SF, and you were not so.
 
I am pretty sure, in retrospect, that my problem with Philly was that I didnt figure it out. That is not to say that I should have stayed in Philly & figured it out. If I had, I may have loved it there. But leaving was a much quicker route to the things I wanted.

Interesting post, Aaron. Ive lived in both places, San Francisco now for almost 5 years, and Cambridge (in various places around Harvard Square) for several years previously. I do miss Cambridge a little bitand can relate to your experiences in both places. That being said, though, I do have some thoughts
 
I think that you can surround yourself with the things you like to be around wherever you live-well, at least specifically in these two places. It can more or less difficult in some areas, but it can be done. Its taken me a long time to find my niche in SF- people I can relate to, and friends-rather than acquaintances. I think I fell into the trap of passively looking for the things I craved, instead of proactively finding them & taking a leap of faith every now and then.
 
I think SF is full of a lot of people that are searching for this niche, in fact, I think thats part of the attraction-you can find whatever youre looking for here. But, it can sometimes take some time. Its not a college town, like Cambridge/Boston-its a post college playpen.
 
And-no comment on the weather.

Welcome back to Cambridge. I definitely understand the contrast between San Francisco and Cambridge; I find it really hard to explain to my fellow students that I actually enjoy New England and that I cant stand spending long periods of time in California.
 
With your move back to Cambridge, what are you going to be focusing your energy on? Im curious to hear about the latest-and-greatest that you have planned, though Im sure it will be documented here on your blog in due time.
 
I dont know if you remember, but we sat down for lunch back in the summer of 2005 in Cambridge - perhaps it would be interesting to have lunch together again now, 3 years and two cities later?

Hey Aaron!  Too bad to hear that youre leaving San Francisco.. I hear your criticism though, and I grew up in this city.  I think SF can be very shallow, but it depends on who you know and where you spend your time.  The male dominated, startup-filled cafes in the Mission are definitely annoying at times.. its ironic that this incredible place with such diverse projects and brilliance living within it can produce such a predictable overall, wonky culture sometimes.

I have also lived in both Cambridge (Porter Sq Harvard Sq was too loud ;) and the Bay Area. I find that there are certainly pros and cons:
 
Boston:
 
I liked the history, and the ability to get to places like Maine in an hour. and NYC in 3+. I liked the crazy road system as I am from London so I felt at home. I liked the people. I did find it a pain in the arse to do simple things though, and the winter. ergh.
 
SF:
 
It feels more like a town than a city. You have to find your niche within. It has taken me awhile to get into it. Being around so much tech can start to be a drain. Sometimes I long for the time when I was living in Madison and noone had a clue what I did ;)
 
And the end of this all, I long for Boulder ;)
 
Heres to you finding your dream location.

I live in Berkeley (across the bay from SF for those who dont know the area), and I also believe that SF is kind of superficial. Berkeley has issues too, but theyre not of the same variety.
 
What I personally dont like about SF is the suffocating trendiness of all the wannabe hipsters with babies on their shoulders, attired in 70s retro-chic t-shirts with carefully made-up hair (made to look not made up) and some kind of wolf-chihuahua or shi-tzu-lhasa-apso flavor-of-the-month hybrid dog in tow.
 
Lots of good stuff comes through town in the way of music though, and the variety and quality of food (for reasonable prices) in restaurants is hard to beat.
 
People are pretty superficial everywhere though, especially the kind of people that think partying and dinner partying with a bunch of different people every week is the peak of existence.
 
I may be wrong, and it may be the case that Cambridge is actually an intellectuals Shangri La that is unlike every other city on the planet (of SF at least), but I suspect that it may be the case that Aaron found a bunch of compatible souls over a relatively long period of time (not by going to parties or quick visits to the library) and that if he went back to Cambridge with a different body and a different name, with the persona he has now (as opposed to that he had when he formed those relationships), and did the things he has talked about doing in SF (going to the library and parties) that his experience would be much the same.

Aaron, I am sorry about your decision. I myself decided to move to the Bay Area (right now I live in New Orleans, which is definitely not the geek or intellectual capital of the USA). Concerning East Coast intellectual dreams: I suggest to move to the real Cambridge, in UK, Eropes (I lived there for 3 months) and I guarantee that your high-browness will be satisfied, although you might still have issues with the weather. You are a very scarce type: a coder/engineer turned philosopher/human intellectual in the US. You have the analytical talent to be successful in philosophy and thereby help a discipline that is not too successful in giving people explanations overall. A lost battle I think. 
I myself started as a biologist, then studied analytical philosophy for 5 years and now I am finally back in science and technology (a reverse direction comparing to yours) so my advice is not advice for you.
Good luck and maybe we can meet at the SciFoo Camp again, Attila

San Francisco is well known as a hard place to relate to  despite all thats going on and all the people seeking something. No one seems to know why. I lived in the city and surrounding areas for about 15 years, then moved to Philadelphia for work. West Philadelphia is fine, except that the whole city is gentrifying, becoming considerably more expensive and driving out good people.
 
I love Harvard Square; went to college there in the 60s and will be visiting at the end of this month. Good Wi-Fi cafes have been scarce right around the Square, but they could be found. There were at least a couple in Central Square. And theres always Somerville.
 
Im working on allowing online financial accounts to actually reproduce children accounts, inherit services, and evolve autonomously through community use  in an open-source project for public benefit. Email me if youre interested. I could meet in Cambridge in the three days or so after June 28, or on a later visit.

I jumped in on this thread b/c although my partner and I live in SF, we often  discuss if another city might be better.  Interestingly, one city thats proposed as better is LA, which is stereotypically more shallow  yet not in our experience.   I think the general stereotypes dont apply and a circle of good friends creates its own microcosm effect.

Title: Is Undercover Over?
 
My latest piece for Extra! is now up:
 
Is Undercover Over?: Disguise seen as deceit by timid journalists
 
Its about the rise and fall of undercover journalism. Heres an excerpt:
 
Undercover reporting has a storied history. Nellie Bly, famous for traveling around the world in 80 days, also did a famed investigation of the conditions in insane asylums for the New York World. Bly feigned insanity for a series of physicians before being committed to a lunatic asylum. There she documented rotten and spoiled food, freezing living conditions, frigid bathwater, abusive nurses and relatively sane fellow residents. What, excepting torture, would produce insanity quicker than this treatment? she wondered. The series, later published as the book Ten Days in a Mad-House, created a sensation, and Bly was asked to join a government investigation of asylum conditions.

I liked the article and agree with the opinion that it seems to convey.
 
The question running through my head while reading it, Is it really that hard not to get sued? It seems like you can be creative in your deception and double check your allegations. Furthermore, are allegations made by undercover investigations any more likely to spur a lawsuit than those made through more conventional journalism?

Title: How to Promote Startups
 
When people talk about how government can promote startups, there seems to be a fairly standard consensus: we need more economic inequality. Lower income and capital gains taxes provide more incentive to work, looser labor laws make it easier to fire non-performers, and large private wealth funds provide investment capital.
 
But having been through a startup myself, I think theres much more you can do in the other direction: decreasing economic inequality. People love starting companies. You get to be your own boss, work on something you love, do something new and exciting, and get lots of attention. As Daniel Brook points out in The Trap, 28% of Americans have considered starting their own business. And yet only 7% actually do.
 
What holds them back? The lack of a social safety net. A friend of mine, a brilliant young technologist whos been featured everywhere from PBS to Salon, stayed in academia and the corporate world while all of her friends were starting companies and getting rich. Why? Because she couldnt afford to lose her health insurance. Between skyrocketing prices and preexisting condition exclusions, its almost impossible for anyone who isnt in perfect health to quit their job. (I only managed because I was on a government plan.)
 
Anyone with children is also straight out. Startup founders tend to be quite young, in no small part because no one can afford to support a family on a startup founders salary. But if we had universal child care, that would be much less of an issue. Parents would be free to pursue their dreams, knowing that their children were taken care of. And universal higher education could let parents spend their savings on getting a business started, instead of their childrens tuition. Plus, itd give many more kids the training and confidence they needed to start a company.
 
And those large private wealth funds that result from growing inequality? A real problem for startup founders is that theyre too large. It used to be that you could borrow a couple thousand dollars from friends and neighbors to get your business off the ground. Nowadays, theyre too busy trying to make ends meet to be able to afford anything like that. Meanwhile, those large wealth funds I mentioned are now so big they can only afford to invest in multi-million dollar chunks  much more than the average founder needs, or can even justify. And the large investments come with large amounts of scrutiny, further narrowing the recipient pool.
 
But imagine if the government provided a basic minimum income, like Richard Nixon once proposed. Instead of having to save up (increasingly difficult in a world in which the only way to survive is on credit card debt) or borrow money to stay afloat, you could live off the government-provided income as you got things started. Suddenly having to quit your job would no longer be such a huge leap  thered be a real social safety net to catch you. (Not to mention if those labor laws some people want to loosen required your old job to take you back if things didnt work out.)
 
Of course, there is some truth to the standard proposals. Some startup founders are encouraged by dreams of financial security, and high taxes can make that dream more elusive. And complex labor regulations can make it difficult to get new companies off the ground. But its not an issue of whether we should have taxes or labor laws  its an issue of how theyre targeted.
 
Estate taxes on inherited fortunes would have basically no impact on startup founders, but could go a long way to funding a social safety net. And since most startups are acquired as stock, income taxes are basically irrelevant  its really capital gains tax that gets applied. Theres no reason the government couldnt apply a lower capital gains tax to startups that get acquired than they do to the shares of publicly-traded companies that large investors trade.
 
The same is true for labor laws: preventing large companies from firing people 
at random can provide some much-needed stability to their lives, especially if theyre saving up money in the hopes of going into business themselves. But theres no reason such laws also have to be applied to small startups, where the company is more likely to go out of business than to fire you.
 
Look at social democratic Europe, where these policy prescriptions have been tried. While theres much less of a culture of entrepreneurship and only 15% of Europeans think about starting their own company, nearly all (14.7%) of them actually go ahead and do it.
 
The fact is, if governments really want to promote startups and the economic innovation they bring, they shouldnt listen to the standard refrain of cut taxes and deregulate. They need to start rebuilding the social safety net, so that their citizens know that if they go out on a limb and try something risky, someone will be there to catch them if things dont work out.
 
Thanks to Daniel Brooks book The Trap: Selling Out to Stay Afloat in Winner-Take-All America for suggesting this line of argument and providing the statistics.

I definitely would have quit my job and started my own company long ago if I had access affordable health insurance outside work. But Im not entirely sure that would have been a good decision. While I agree with everything you say here, it still feels like there are some subtle positive aspects of the current environment we may lose with a safety net, e.g. forcing better planning of startups by making them contingent on better life planning. I dont imagine those are anywhere near worth the pitfalls of the current environment, but it would be good to consider them further to ease the transition.

Good post.
As an entrepreneur in Israel, having high quality government funded healthcare has certainly helped me bootstrap my current startup. My calculations would have been very different if I had to take health insurance into account.
 
Im not sure though that your conclusion regarding Europeans (where almost all who consider starting a business actually do it) is necessarily correct. 
Maybe in a culture where entrepreneurship isnt as glamorous as it is in the US, those who profess that they consider starting a business are only the real die-hard born-to-be-entrepreneurs, essentially the same people who manage to overcome the hurdles in the US and do their own thing at all costs? 
In a place like California (or Israel for that matter), where entrepreneurship is admired, many more people consider it, or would tell you so in a survey, even though theyre not really serious. I have friends who keep talking about starting their own business, but would probably never do it - not because they lack the wherewithal, but because they havent really got it in them.
 
Moreover, starting a company in most countries of western Europe is much harder than it is in the US. It takes financial commitment up-front, as well as going through a lot of bureaucracy. The state, while it provides the social safety net, puts serious hurdles in the would-be business owners way, and you could argue that these are just as bad as the lack of a safety net.

+1, Aaron.
 
Im a parent of 2, and its frustrating as all hell that I cant work out a way to start a startup without putting my family at risk.
 
Its fairly well established that no angel or VC investor will want to look at you until youve at the very least finished a prototype, more likely not until youve finished the product, and even more likely not until youve shown traction by attracting a decent number of users.  In the meantime, that probably means a good year of going without income in order to get to that point.  Whos got the kind of money to keep a family afloat during that time?!?!?!?  Some of us werent born with rich family or friends.
 
I havent figured a way out of this conundrum yet, but Im damn well going to because I refuse to go my whole life working for someone else.  (Most likely in order to fund this Ill have to sell my home, and rent in a cheaper location for a while.)
 
But it sure is good to hear someone going against the conventional wisdom (aka bullshit) on this issue and telling it like it is, Aaron.
 
Meritocracy, my ass!  The startup world is a plutocracy, pure and simple.  If you dont have someone with big bucks behind you, youre shut out.  The only people whose merit matters are the ones who are able to pony up the ante.

And I know so many people who are waiting for their life to be settled and stable before they begin. This is one of the main social influences repressing our potential founders.

How many of these policies would you support even if they had zero impact on startups?  I ask because all your suggestions that are particular to startups actually involve the standard refrain of cut taxes and deregulate
 
Things that are good for everyone are good for everyone but I cant but help notice that your more socialist suggestions are about people not like you (help families and older people, stick it to big business, etc) and your more free market suggestions apply to areas where you have local experience.

Is this satire? Because I really dont see how it could be anything else, except perhaps insanity.
 
The problem with providing these sorts of benefits to everyone is that it removes nearly all extrinsic motivations for work. Unfortunately, I believe that youll find that the fraction of the human population that is intrinsically motivated to work is by no means large enough to support the entire populationand if this is the case, then the reforms you propose would eventually cause the collapse of civilization (assuming that someone did not eventually stop the madness).

I agree with some of your arguments, particularly the one about health insurance. I mean, survive you must, and fear of dying doesnt help startup founders to be bold.
 
But I also know how incredibly hard it is in many european countries to get your own business started, and to a large degree it is hard because of the safety net that others enjoy.
 
That famous european safety net has one salient characteristic. Its much better for those groups who are better organised and who have a long tradition of being close to the government and the political parties. Pensioners, workers in well unionised sectors, farmers, civil servants, railway workers, medical doctors, teachers, etc.
 
As a startup founder, almost by definition, you dont belong to any of those groups. When I started my first business, I had to pay hugely more social security contributions and taxes than any 9 to 5 worker (relative to my meagre income). Effectively, I had to pay for their safety net, a safety net that partly excludes entrepreneurs. If I couldve just kept my own money, pay nothing and get nothing, I wouldve been better off.
 
I agree that a basic safety net that catches you when you fall is a good thing. But that european safety net catches like 80% of the people, costs almost 50% of our income and fails many of those who actually need it. I wonder if that is an automatic consequence of democratically organised redistribution.

Your intro paragraph infers it all: we need more economic inequality. Lower income and capital gains taxes provide more incentive to work, looser labor laws make it easier to fire non-performers, and large private wealth funds provide investment capital. <br/>
This statement is not economic theory: not that you state it is, but rather that mainstream business and politics tell us it is.  This construct is barely even economic hypothesis; not even well founded wishful thinking. Rather wolfish greed wrapped in lambskin. <br/>
I have been an IT entrepreneur for 20 years and never consider those economic principals when making my start-up decisions.  I have only accomplished my most recent startup, ShellShadow because I am living in China now and have economic leverage to do so on a tight budget.<br/>
The theory that people create due to economic inequality is pure bunk.  People can get very rich due to economic inequality but it has little to do with creativity or a desire to create.

The safety net is a good pointyou are right, it was previously friends and family, but today most are tapped out.
 
However, instead of the government stepping in, what if friends, family, spouses, and want-to-be entrepenuers stopped promising away their entire current and future income (via mortgages and loans) so that they could go back to being the social safety net that they once were?
 
My grandparents at several times lived with other family, and several times had other family live with them, while starting out. And so while they used mortgages and loans, it wasnt so early and so leveraged that they could no longer be a safety net for others.
 
Granted, their lifestyle was not what most people likely expect these daysbut that is a trade off everyone is free to make, lower your lifestyle today and have more choices, or raise your lifestyle today and have less choices.
 
(Basically, DAG is righthe should sell the house he can only afford on a 30-year corporate salary and rent in a cheaper location. That is economic tradeoffs and it works much better when individuals make these decisions for themselves instead of the government deciding for the whole citizenship that it knows best.)
 
I also wonder how much the lack of a safety net is real or just perceived due to our individualistic, self-reliant culture.
 
Granted, I admire your goals, but good goals doesnt mean that, once in place, a program will automatically acheive those goals. Goals vs. incentives is discussed nicely in Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell.

Title: The False Consciousness Falsehood
 
American intellectual life has a large number of ways of responding to an argument without actually addressing its substance  namecalling in other words. You can say that someone is blaming the victim or spinning a conspiracy theory or assuming people are stupid or that theyre subject to false consciousness.
 
Most of these are kind of transparently silly, but even otherwise smart people seem to think the false consciousness charge has some heft to it. The argument is never fully spelled-out, but the argument seems to be that to think that people are systematically mistaken about their own interests is the kind of crazy idea that only vulgar Marxists would believe and, furthermore, it requires assuming that people are stupid and explaining how youve been able to see past the illusion.
 
Well, Im personally not under any illusion that providing a rational explanation is going to stop people from leveling this charge, but I figure one ought to, if only to set the record straight.
 
Lets begin with a parable  a simplified case that will at least establish whether some of these arguments are logically true. Imagine a new regime comes to power that decides to imprison everyone with red hair. They insist that there is nothing amiss about this  they were elected democratically, and furthermore, everyone imprisoned is still allowed to vote. But inside the prisons, they only permit limited contact with the outside world. Most prisoners only watch the one prison-provided news station which is systematically biased, constantly suggesting that the Purple Party is in favor of additional rights for red-haired people while their opponents, the Yellow Party, just used the red-haired issue for pandering. (Anyone whos watched, say, Fox News discuss black issues will know how this is possible.) The result is that when election time rolls around, the majority of red-haired prisoners vote for the Purple Party candidate who gets into power and provides no new rights for them.
 
Call it false consciousness or not, I think its perfectly reasonable to look at this situation and say while the red-haired prisoners are not stupid, they are systematically mistaken, which is leading them to act against their own interests. If they knew the truth they would vote for the Yellow Party, the party which wants to take steps to get them out of prison, instead. Furthermore, its possible to imagine that there are some prisoners who, through one means or another, have learned this and thus are able to see this situation while the other prisoners do not. (They try to tell the other prisoners whats going on, but they keep getting labeled conspiracy theorists.)
 
Now obviously vast portions of America are not imprisoned. But most people do get their news from a small number of sources and I think everyone would agree that, in one way or another, these sources are systematically biased. (You can argue about which way theyre biased or whether it makes a difference, but I think its pretty clear that all the major news sources share a general conception of what is news and what isnt.) So why is it so implausible that something similar is going on?
 
The major difference between the two scenarios is that in the first, people were basically forced to watch the biased news, while in the real world they have lots of other alternatives. But Im not sure this matters as much as it might seem at first.
 
First, most people have busy lives that dont revolve around the news or politics and thus are going to get the news in the most convenient form they can. For most people, this is typically television or the newspaper. But starting a new television station or newspaper is very expensive, especially if you want it to have wide reach, and the only projects that can get funding and advertising are those that buy into at least some of the systematic biases. So for most people, there simply isnt a better alternative when it comes to the formats they want.
 
Second, even if someone gets their news from the Internet or another source where getting started is less expensive, they may not know about the alternatives. If you grew up with your parents reading the New York Times you may simply live your life checking in on nytimes.com, without ever stopping to wonder whether the news you were getting was systematically biased and whether there was some more preferable alternative.
 
Again, just as there was no way for the prisoners to know they were being lied to, its not really reasonable for the average person to figure out that theyre getting biased news if the only news they read comes from biased sources.
 
Now Im not arguing here that this idea is true (that would require more real-world evidence), merely that its possible. The fact is that we live in a world where most people get their information about whats going on from a very small number of sources which tend to report largely the same things in the same way. This seems like a rather important fact of life and I think we ought to stop dismissing suggestions that it might have some negative effects on people out of hand.

I think one major reluctance to accepting conspiracy theories on a large level is that, to reference a previous post, people dont believe that the mechanism exists.  If there was media bias of a malevolent sort, then there must be a conspiracy to construct and enforce that bias.  Editors punish their subordinates.  Editors themselves must be informed of what the accepted lines of thought are.  People have proposed mechanisms for this, have documented actual processes.  But its not clear that those form the bias, because for everyplace that has such hints of conspiracy there is a large number of places that clearly have no conspiracy (often just for lack of interestingness).
 
Another aspect is none of this seems new.  Its not like the media was crazy progressive and then this darn media consolidation came along and ruined it.  Is this the product of a long line of conspiracies?  The masons?
 
Im more apt to see this as a phenomena than a conspiracy.  That is, accepting that people can have false beliefs on a large scale doesnt require a malevolent actor.  Theres lots of cases of this that are rather obvious in retrospect.  Flat Earth  that people have at times widely believed the Earth to be flat is not a sign of wide stupidity.  Our intuitions can be reasonable while also being incorrect.  Revealing the truth does not automatically convert everyones belief.
 
The mechanisms by which we come to other beliefs is probably different than something so fact-based as the nature of the surface of the Earth.  But theres obviously more involved than simple rationality, especially because many value-based beliefs are rooted in underlying motivations that cant really be rational.

Hope all is well, and that your health has improved after that discouraging post from a few months ago.  I think what youre talking about is whats plausible rather than whats logical or rational. It would be just as valid to spin a self-serving parable demonstrating how the idea of false consciousness fails to explain events, and wed have learned as much from the exercise. I also dont understand the point of the conclusion: that its merely possible the idea of false consciousness can be valid, given an impressive stack of assumptions. And?

Reading the post again, the first couple of paragraphs strike me as confusing. The first states that saying someone is subject to false consciousness is a way of avoiding the substance of any argument hes making  namecalling in other words. The second says essentially the opposite: that criticizing this assignment of false consciousness is an invalid form of namecalling, i.e., by labeling the idea of false consciousness as crazy or Marxist. (The first paragraph only makes sense in the context of the rest of the post if it ends with something like: or assigning false consciousness to people.)
 
These opening paragraphs are amusing as well. After being told this charge constitutes namecalling, we learn it is transparently silly. Unintelligent people can of course be expected to make such a charge, but even otherwise smart people make it as well. Regardless, youre not under any illusion that providing a rational explanation is going to stop people from leveling this charge. So: silly, stupid, and irrational. Nope, no namecalling here.

Whats interesting is that you dont need a conspiracy theory to get the result of conspiracy theory.  All you need to do is look at the selection process.  Can an economics professor be fired for being wrong?  Nope.  But a professor can get more grants and power by justifying the prevailing political powers.
 
Were Bill Kristol and Tom Friedman fired for being wrong about the war in Iraq?  Bill Kristol was promoted to the NY Times editorial page!
 
If the media and educational system do not seem to be promoting or firing people based on whether they get things right and wrong, why would we expect the process to produce accurate results?

You have some truly bizarre spam just above this comment.
 
I agree with Sierra that the first couple of paragraphs are muddled.  From the rest of your essay, youre apparently claiming that the charge of false consciousness should be taken seriously in a debate.  But thats not how you start off.
 
I think it is possible for people to be systematically mistaken about this or that, and its reasonable to discuss that possibility in itself, as you start to do here.
 
But in an ordinary discussion about some other subject, accusing your opponent of false consciousness is not an argument, its a failure to argue.  Its an example of the logical fallacy poisoning the well.  Reasonable people are right to reject it in those cases.

Matts comment made me wonder what kind of criteria would make the idea of false consciousness valid. I think it would require a good deal of ignorance or physical coercion, and would be least likely in an information-saturated modern society. E.g., Ive heard many women in strict Islamic cultures express strong approval for their burkas, but its valid to assume (if theyre not lying outright) thats false consciousness resulting from the constant threat of beating or worse if they dont wear a burka, or perhaps from having no accurate information on societies where women wear whatever they want. The flip-side, to use an obvious example: In this culture, women arent beaten for being pro-choice on abortion, and they have plenty of pro-choice information available to them, so its correspondingly invalid to suggest pro-life women suffer from false consciousness. Aarons parable is unconvincing because it involves taking great pains to limit available information, which simply is not our situation. The idea that people with huge numbers of alternative media sources available to them are going to keep reading the New York Times out of blind habit is contradicted by the latters stock price, and by the sudden, spontaneous popularity of sites like YouTube, Facebook, you name it.
 
Theres an excellent book called Sick Societies, by the anthropologist Harold Edgerton. Ostensibly its a critique of the idea that primitive cultures are peaceful and harmonious, and that all sorts of horrifying (to us) practices are adaptive in the evolutionary sense. But the more interesting implication is the possibility of determining whether aspects of our own culture are objectively dysfunctional, criteria he says may be borrowed from psychology. Im skeptical how rigorous that framework would be, but its an interesting book thats relevant to the question, if you care to take a look.

Title: Tectonic Plates and Microfoundations
 
In 1915, Alfred Wegener argued that all the continents of Earth once used to fit together as one giant supercontinent, which he later named Pangea. As Wikipedia summarizes:
 
In his work, Wegener presented a large amount of circumstantial evidence in support of continental drift, but he was unable to come up with a convincing mechanism. Thus, while his ideas attracted a few early supporters  the hypothesis was generally met with skepticism. The one American edition of Wegeners work  was received so poorly that the American Association of Petroleum Geologists organized a symposium specifically in opposition.  By the 1930s, Wegeners geological work was almost universally dismissed by the scientific community and remained obscure for some thirty years.
 
Today, of course, every schoolchild knows about Pangea. But for a long time the theory was dismissed, not because it lacked evidence or predictive power  it explained why the shapes of the continents fit together, why mountain ranges and coal fields lined up, why similar fossil were found in places separated by oceans, and so on  but because Wegener had no plausible mechanism.
 
A similar problem happens in the social sciences. Paul Krugman recently noted that while Larry Bartels (in his new book Unequal Democracy) provides solid, convincing evidence that Republican presidents systematically preside over slower growth and increasing inequality, most social scientists dont believe him because we havent yet identified the mechanisms. Krugman:
 
Now, Im a big Bartels fan; Ive known about this result for quite a while. But Ive never written it up. Why? Because I cant figure out a plausible mechanism. Even though I believe that politics has a big effect on income distribution, this is just too strong  and too immediate  for me to see how it can be done. Sure, Republicans want an oligarchic society  but how can they do that?
 
Bartels, for his part, argues that providing the mechanisms isnt his job  his goal is to highlight the phenomena and encourage many others to research the mechanisms:
 
How do presidents produce these substantial effects?
 
One of my aims in writing Unequal Democracy was to prod economists and policy analysts to devote more attention to precisely that question. Douglas Hibbs did important work along these lines  He found that Democrats favored expansionary policies  while Republicans endured and sometimes prolonged recessions in order to keep inflation in check. (Not coincidentally, unemployment mostly affects income growth among relatively poor people, while inflation mostly affects income growth among relatively affluent people.) In recent decades taxes and transfers have probably been more important. Social spending. Business regulation or lack thereof. And dont forget the minimum wage. Over the past 60 years, the real value of the minimum wage has increased by 16 cents per year under Democratic presidents and declined by 6 cents per year under Republican presidents; thats a 3% difference in average income growth for minimum wage workers, with ramifications for many more workers higher up the wage scale. So, while I dont pretend to understand all the ways in which presidents policy choices shape the income distribution, I see little reason to doubt that the effects are real and substantial.
 
When it comes to addressing such arguments more generally, the most famous commentator is Jon Elster. In his classic article Marxism, Functionalism, and Game Theory, he insists:
 
Without a firm knowledge about the mechanisms that operate at the individual level, the grand Marxist claims about macrostructures and long-term change are condemned to remain at the level of speculation.
 
(To be fair, Elster doesnt make this as a general argument, but his vehemence has led some of his followers to suggest that it is.)
 
To be clear, I think discovering mechanisms is important work. All Im arguing is that it shouldnt be a necessity for believing in a theory. Instead, I believe its an irrational side-effect of an emotional distaste for gaps in knowledge.
 
As evidence, let me note that such demands for mechanisms never go more than one level deep. Nobody has ever said, Well, your theory that people are motivated by greed is all very nice, but I just cant believe it until you can explain how greed is manifested in the brain. Neuroscience is obviously the microfoundation of psychology, but psychological theories are regularly accepted without neuroscientific microfoundations.
 
In general, it seems like such commentators support a double-standard. Theories with mechanisms should be judged by their fit with the evidence and predictive power. Theories without mechanisms should be judged by the evidence and predictive power and whether you can think of any plausible mechanisms. I dont see how this can be justified. Theres no reason mechanism should be privileged in the assessment of knowledge; things are true or false, even if we dont know why they are true or false.
 
Indeed, it we typically only investigate the causes of phenomena once were convinced that they exist. (Elster admits as much in Explaining Social Behavior, noting that establishing a phenomenas existence is the first step towards explaining it.) So lets stop making the mistake of not believing things are true because we dont know how they happen.

Without a mechanism, how can we distinguish between cause and effect?  Perhaps people turn to Republicans because of other actually causal phenomena.  And frankly, in any social situation, causality just wont be there  too many feedback loops and too many independent actors.
 
If all someone is arguing for is correlation, then thats a rather boring thing to argue about.  Causation is the thing that is exciting.
 
Even causation can be a little boring.  Causation that can be effected and changed, now that is interesting.
 
The scientific approach then would be to empirically determine what can cause change.  What are electrons, or protons, or quarks?  Eh, who knows, but we know how we can manipulate things with them, how we can see the side effects.  Social theory often seems more interested in what these things are, as though there is some value to the thing itself, and not so interested in what can be done.

You seem to believe that not having a mechanism limits you to making claims about correlation, not causation. Thats not true at all. Imagine someone gave you a red button and pressing it caused a man to shout yap! You can clearly establish a causal connection  do double-blind tests if you have to  even if you have no idea how it makes the man say that.

I would say its sometimes not an easy task to figure out whats true but unexplained, what seems to be true but is a thinking error, whats lies that are just widely repeated, whats correlation but not causation, whats finding spurious coincidences, etc.
 
Yes, things are true or false - but you dont know which is which beforehand.
 
Politics can be especially hard, since there are people who have as their jobs making the false seem true, and the true seem false.

Interesting post, which I generally agree with.  But this In general, it seems like such commentators support a double-standard is incorrect.
 
Theres one standard: Theories should be judged by the evidence and predictive power and whether you can think of any plausible mechanisms.  It just happens that for theories with mechanisms you can, in fact, think of plausible mechanisms.
 
Otherwise its like arguing  a double-standard. Theories without evidence are to be judged by their predictive power and whether you can think of any evidence.  Theories with evidence are to be judged by their predictive power alone.

I agree that this is an interesting correlation, and in general that we should look for mechanisms
 
But at the same time we should always worry that the effect might not exist. For this one I know of three objections:
 
It needs a one-year lag between president and income. Thats not implasible but its one more parameter.
 
It uses pre-tax family income, from income tax I think? This is somewhat succeptible to adjustments to minimise tax paid. Higher taxes can scare the rich into sheltering income somehow. (I think this is the same data that leads to an underestimate of inequality in the 70s, for this reason.)
 
Werent the republicans supposed to be the party of fiscal prudence, earlier in this data set? In other words the categories shift over time.

Shame on you, Aaron. You should know better than to look for awkward correlations between enormous generalizations.
 
I dont know enough to argue, but even if there is a correlation between Dems and progress, we should be careful what you do with such correlations.
 
Consider one of those old hand-powered water pumps. Observing someone operating the pump would lead you to conclude that there is a clear correlation between pushing down on the handle and water coming out. Surely, we would be tempted to conclude, there is no point to lifting the handle at all. To maximize the amount of water we get, we should just sit on the handle.
 
Our economic and political systems are much more complicated than we have so far been able to comprehend, and looking for correlations between changing political labels and imprecise economic measurements is silly.

People weigh a lot of factors when deciding whether a theory is plausible.  If you have a demonstrated mechanism, that makes a theory more plausible than if youve just imagined up a possible mechanism.
 
Its not irrational to include it in the factors weighed, even if it would be irrational to make it a be-all-and-end-all criterion for plausibility.

Maybe a concrete example would help.  If my computer crashes while Im depressed, I dont even seriously consider the possibility that it did so because Im depressed.  If it does so 10 times, and none when Im cheerful, then I start to wonder, but again, suspect that Im missing something else thats actually causing it.  If it happens 1000 times, and none when Im cheerful, and I cant find any more plausible causes, then I start to accept that its caused by my depression, even though it seems unlikely, i.e. despite the lack of plausible mechanism.

I write about medical research. Here, people are more likely to believe a drug works if a plausible mechanism is known. But this is almost entirely because a plausible mechanism gives a boost to difficult decision-making under uncertainty. If there is clear empirical evidence, then people will use an important drug whether any mechanism is available or not.
 
Thanks for letting me know about Unequal Democracy, and the strong evidence of a Democratic/Republican difference. Clearly presidents can do a lot to mess up the country. If they can do it in part by changing widespread public attitudes and assumptions (as seems plausible), then the time frame to make actual changes could be a day or less. Of course the economic statistics will need some time to catch up.

Title: Simplistic Sociological Functionalism
 
(I thought I should talk about the other form of functionalism for a change.)
 
Often sociologists notice a pattern in which certain attributes of a social system fits well with a particular social structure. To take an example I have at hand, Rosabeth Moss Kanter notes that because a secretary has access to facts that could embarrass her boss, its convenient for the boss that the secretary is entirely dependent upon him for wages and status.
 
Unfortunately, these claims are often phrased as saying X causes Y. Heres how Kanter does it:
 
The possibilities for blackmail inherent in [a secretarys] access  to the real story behind the bosss secrets  made it important that she identify her interest as running with, rather than against, his. Thus, forces were generated for the maintenance of a system in which the secretary  was to find her status and reward level dependent on the status and, hence, success of her boss. (Men and Women of the Corporation, 82)
 
Note that, although she is unusually careful to hedge her comments (made it important, forces were generated, maintenance of a system) Kanter is making a particular historical claim here: the secretary could blackmail, which pushed the boss to tighten control. But this is not the type of claim that Kanter, whos research consisted mostly of direct observation of present-day offices, is likely to have any real evidence for.
 
Making such claims is problematic, both because most sociologists dont really know whether they are strictly true, and because they lead Jon Elster to show up at your house and yell at you for hours. But both problems can be easily avoided: simply rephrase such comments to describe the phenomena as effects rather than causes.
 
Instead of saying a secretarys ability to blackmail leads bosses to tighten their grip, simply note that the bosss tight grip has the effect of weakening the secretarys ability to blackmail. You get all the same points across and nobody gets hurt. See? Easy.

Title: How to Fix the News
 
Newspaper circulation continues to decline. The top-selling paper in the country, USA Today, distributes only 2 million copies a day (half, no doubt, placed outside hotel room doors). Around the same number, with an average age of 71, watch The OReilly Factor nightly, with the number decreasing as the audience dies off. Everyone quietly concedes the news industry is dying. Its the Internets fault, they all assure us.
 
But what if it wasnt? The other day I heard a news program that was so good that I wanted to listen to it again. And Im not alone  all my friends have been talking about it as well. And while I dont have exact numbers, it seems as popular as any one of those other news outlets. That show? The This American Life episode on The Global Pool of Money  a comprehensive explanation of the housing mess.
 
There were three things about the show that made it stand out from the rest of the news pack:
 
It believed in the intelligence of its audience. It didnt try to pander with sex or disasters or quick cuts. It took a serious news story and investigated it thoroughly for a full hour, with only one break. And it didnt try and dumb any of it down  it explained the whole thing, from top to bottom.
 
It didnt assume you already knew the subject. Most news stories on important topics are incomprehensible to the average person who doesnt know much about their topic. Heres a quote from a random news story about the housing crisis: They said financial institutions have been unwilling to expose themselves to the mortgage market, and lenders are hesitant to lend to risky borrowers in a declining house price market after the subprime meltdown. Unless youve been following the story (like the reporter, presumably) do you really know what that means? TAL instead assumed you knew nothing and explained every component and term so that you actually had a picture of what was going on.
 
It was done in an entertaining and conversational tone. It didnt treat the news as some important series of facts that had to be seriously conveyed to you. It treated it as something interesting they wanted to tell you about, a story that involved real peoples lives (who you got to hear from at length) and was full of genuinely interesting pieces. Look at that news quote above one more time. Can you really imagine someone sitting down and saying that with a straight face?
 
At first these things may seem contradictory  how can you believe in the intelligence of your audience while assuming they dont know anything? how can you be entertaining and yet still explain a subject?  but the more you think about them you see how well they fit together. Being intelligent doesnt mean youre knowledgeable; it means youre curious. Which means you want to hear the whole story from beginning to end and which means you might actually find it entertaining. And being conversational prevents you from assuming the mask that lets you talk down to your audience while pretending they only need to hear the handful of new facts that youre providing.
 
In every other field, that kind of formality has been dropped. Even banks run advertisements these days about how their associates will be your friend. And yet the news chugs along with its arrogant formality, watching its audience get older and older, and wondering why its circulation is declining.
 
Together, these three points seem like the recipe for a genuine news show: intelligent, comprehensive, and entertaining. And yet, I cant think of a single thing that follows them. Surely in an era of desperation and experimentation, the wacky idea of actually respecting your audience has to be worth a try by someone. Anyone want to give it a shot?

I agree that the TAL piece was excellent, but I wouldnt say that the Guardian pieces conveys far less information.  Perhaps the Guardian didnt touch on the relaxation of regulations for US mortgage applications prior to the crunch, but the general story and main issues (viz. nature of CDOs and rating agency mistakes) are still there.
 
Unfortunately many (most?) things are inherently complex and require more than a 2 minute segment in a news programme to allow viewers/readers to gain a thorough understanding.   My view is that the news media merely point out a subset of stories  usually relevant to only them and or their publishers/owners  and leave it to us to find out more.
 
I dont think there is enough time in the day to allow one hour programmes examining each and every pressing issue arising in the world.

MSNBCs research claims that the median age for Mr. OReillys audience is 71, while Mr. Olbermanns is 59. (Fox and CNN both report that the only figures they get for median age of shows with older audiences is 65 plus, and that Mr. OReillys audience falls into that category.)
 
So however you want to put it, its clearly the senior citizens.

Hi Aaron,
 
Great article on an important. I can understand your thoughts on why news seem indecipherable to so many. However, I would agree with some of the other commentators here to say that:
1) this is not a model that can be replicated enmass.
2) this is not the reason why newspaper/print media companies are performing poorly.
 
1) As others have stated above, everyday news is only able to provide daily developments in current issues. They are not able to reiterate the entire history everyday. When I was in highschool and first began reading the newspaper, I had a lot of difficulty since the type of information given is not conducive to the understanding by a first time reader. However, now, since I have a stronger knowledge base to reference from, I find I can last a week between newspaper reading the paper but still completely understand most current events. For the purposes of ongoing and protracted issues, daily developments can only be published piecemeal. However, I agree that a pervasive and complex event could be better explained by a Special report that speaks to the publics intelligence and background knowledge.
(Note: If you enjoy this type of reporting, may I recommend BBC News channel- up to the date news reports punctuated by indepth analyses of specific issues)
 
2) Print media, like many industries, underwent a giant transformation due to the advent of the internet. But content isnt the reason why companies suffered- Delivery was. Companies like Wall Street Journal and the one newspaper Buffet invested in (Chicago based I think) adapted to the internet quite well. It can further be said that Print Media companies had full advantage in using the internet. They were well capitalized, had the infrastructure and network, and many other barriers to entry to be first movers in this space. However, management was incapable of seizing this opportunity.
 
I conclude by saying that i agree with you in that our core audiences needs have changed. However, I would not surmise to think that more exhaustive content is a solution to the print media woes of today. What are your thoughts? Is there room for agreement between our views?

Title: Science or Philosophy?: Jon Elster and John Searle
 
As the name suggests, the social sciences have often seen themselves as an analogue or extension of the natural sciences and have from the beginning aspired to their successes. Like many who want to duplicate success they do not understand, social sciences has been obsessed with duplicating the form of the natural sciences and not its motivations. Just as rival music player manufacturers have tried to copy the look of the iPod without understanding why it takes that look, the social sciences have copied the structure of the natural sciences without understanding why they take that structure.
 
The greatest success of the natural sciences is undoubtedly the laws of physics. Here, an handful of simple equations can accurately predict the motion of a vast variety of everyday objects under common actions. Seeing this, social scientists have aspired to derive similar laws that predict the behavior of whole societies. (Others, meanwhile insist the entire project is impossible because the society will respond to the creation of the law, making the law invalid  reflexivity.)
 
But reflection upon the history of the natural sciences will see that this notion is insane. Physics did not develop thru attempts to discover the laws that explained all of motion. Instead, various kinds of motion (like falling objects) were described, rules for their behavior deduced, and commonalities in those rules discovered. Eventually it was the case that the commonalities were so great and the rules so few that a handful of laws could explain most of the phenomena, but this assumption was not made a priori.
 
Jon Elster argues that the social sciences should proceed in a similar way: various social phenomena should be described, the mechanisms that give rise to them explained, and the commonalities among mechanisms discovered. Most of his work consists of practicing social science in this way, with a few attempts at laying out a toolbox of these common mechanisms.
 
Modern social science is so split between attempts at grand law-like theories and modest essays of careful description that Elsters third way seems alien and hard to comprehend. But there is a clear model that social scientists can look to: analytical philosophy.
 
Analytical philosophers do not take as their task grand law-like explanations for the world. Instead, they set upon a particular piece of conception  language, free will, ethics  and try to discover its logical structure. In doing so they often develop tools they shared in common with other philosophical projects.
 
This similarity can perhaps be best seen in the work of the man who is Jon Elsters closest equivalent in the world of analytical philosophy, John Searle. In his career, Searle has addressed a number of topics: language, intentionality, consciousness, social reality, and rationality. Throughout he has taken has his task providing a clear description of the phenomena and explaining the pieces it consists of. And in explaining those pieces, he frequently develops tools that he reuses in his other explanations.
 
Take the notion of direction of fit. Searle argues that all statements have a direction of fit, which can be either up, down, both, or null. If we imagine (by convention) that statements float above the world pointing down at the things they represent, then statements like John and Jill are married, in which it is the job of the statement to change to accurately represent the world, have a downward direction of fit. By contrast, statements like I want to marry him, in which it is the world must change to match the statement, have an upward direction of fit.
 
This notion, which Searle and Austin developed for describing language, Searle later reused for describing mental states. Love, for example, has an upward direction of fit, belief downward, and joy null. And in my own everyday life, I have found the same tool useful in thinking about various phenomena Ive encountered.
 
Social scientists dont seem to read much philosophy. I suspect most of them see it as an alien culture consisting of, as Paul Graham put it, either highly technical stuff that doesnt matter much, or vague concatenations of abstractions their own authors didnt fully understand. But perhaps they should, because even if the technical stuff lacks interest (and considering some of the topics involved, Im skeptical that this is always the case), the tools, and the way theyre wielded, should be a lesson.

Title: The Toolbox Does Not Shrink
 

 
For the past forty years, Jon Elster has attempted to explain things ranging from the emotions to technological change. The result is dozens of books (and even more papers) in three languages across four universities. And throughout, his work has not just been exemplary social science, but has always struggled with the question of what social science should be  what kinds of explanations are legitimate, which techniques should be used, and so on.
 
As he reaches his late sixties, it is understandable if he begins to think of his legacy. That certainly would help explain his latest book, Explaining Social Behavior: More Nuts and Bolts for the Social Sciences (Cambridge University Press, 2007), a 500-page masterpiece that I expect will be seen as the summation of a brilliant career.
 
Its a book unlike any other and, as a result, unless read from start to finish can seem bizarre, if only because one has little sense of what the book is trying to do. It is not a guidebook, or a textbook, or a piece of social science in itself. In short, it is nothing less than an attempt to summarize an idealized vision of the whole of social science in simple language.
 
The books foundational assumption (as implied by its title) is that the goal of social science is to discover explanations for social phenomena. It begins by describing what explanations are and discussing their different forms. But the bulk of the book consists of tools that can be used in explanations: emotions, norms, time discounting, weakness of will, magical thinking, cognitive dissonance, heuristics and biases, rationality, irrationality, neuroscience, evolution, externalities, game theory, pluralistic ignorance, informational cascades, collective action, cyclical preferences, institutions, etc.  in short, the entire toolkit of the social sciences.
 
Just as amazing as the breadth topics is the way in which theyre covered. Elster explains each phenomenon clearly and concisely, so that any educated reader can understand them with little effort, without ever sacrificing intellectual depth. His explanations are peppered with examples from an amazing variety of sources: ancient history, recent history, personal experience, the classics of social science (e.g. Tocqueville), the great philosophers (Montaigne, Pascal, Mill), and classic novelists (e.g. Proust). The result is a book which not just introduces readers to the discoveries of the social sciences but to the intellectual world as a whole. Bibliographical notes following each chapter as well as the conclusion provide a rich guide for further exploration.
 
And yet its not simply a compendium of interesting results in the social sciences, but attempts to defend a particular conception of what the social sciences should be. In the conclusion, Elster defends his notion of social science as the attempt to discover particular explanations for particular phenomena against the soft obscurantism of the literary theorists and the hard obscurantism of the economists. As part of this, he turns his back on the notion of rational-choice models being an explanation in themselves, noting that their many assumptions are in desperate need of empirical defense.
 
In response to an earlier draft of this review, Elster wrote Im glad you appreciate the details in my book, but youre missing the big picture, which is that there isnt any. Instead of trying to build a Grand Theory which explains all of social life, we should try to build explanations of particular phenomena from the nuts and bolts we have lying around. And even if a dominant explanation of a given event or episode is discarded and then resurrected, the building blocks or mechanisms at work in the discarding and resurrection remain. The repertory, or the size of the toolbox, does not shrink.
 
For anyone who cares about social science, Elster has done an amazing service in clearly describing the toolboxs contents and defending its importance.

Title: Money and Control
 
I never give money to those people, she said. Theyre only going to spend it on drugs, anyway. And whats so wrong with that?, I wondered. I can see why one might want to discourage Harvard students from spending all their time getting stoned (although, I have to say, I dont see anyone doing that), but if your life is spent sitting outside, hungry, cold, and miserable, drugs seem like a pretty decent use of the money.
 
But, more importantly, since when is that your call to make? That you live in a nice house with a bulging wallet and he lives on the street is due to an enormous number of random factors that could just as easily have been reversed. And even if youre arrogant enough to believe youre a better person in some way  smarter, harder-working, more ambitious  since when does being better give you the right to tell other people how to live their lives? Is Tiger Woods allowed to just come along and take the chocolate out of your shopping cart at the supermarket?
 
It is a sad fact of reality that you have money and he has none and that, as a result, he needs the money to buy material goods. But no moral consequences can be derived from this. Just because history has given you the power to choose whether this person can acquire certain material goods doesnt give you the right to make that call.
 
Now its true, you dont have to give him money at all. Most dont. But if you feel that other people deserve to live a life without privation, at least let them choose how to live that life.
 
Perhaps an example closer to home will help. Remember when your father offered to help you buy a house if only you went back to school? That was the same thing  trying to use the fact that he had money and you didnt in order to get you to do what he wanted. For years, hed been trying to get you to go back to school; and you didnt, because it was your decision and you didnt want to. But then he realized he could use the money to control you. Remember how that chafed?
 
At the time you brushed it off as his money, his call. But dont you see how thats not true? Whether you go to school or not was never his call. And while its certainly within his rights to help you buy a house, using that to try to and control you was wrong. You deserve to make your own choices about your life  we all do.
 
Including that man there.

Hi Aaron,
 
While I struggle with the practical implications of your thoughts here, I cant argue much with the logic behind them.
 
I wonder, who is talking about the relationship between the logic of our actions regarding society, and the effects of those action? Perhaps Im getting at this question: on what basis should we evaluate our actions re: society? Logic? Emotion? Pragmatism? Social Darwinism?
 
Thanks for sharing your Thoughts

If Im paying for the material goods, I feel like I should have a certain amount of power over what goods are purchased.  I have a moral opposition to drugs, and so therefore I wont dispense money unless I know for certain it wont be used for drugs.  Subsequently, I dont give money to bums that are likely to use it for drugs.
 
When you ask other people for money without giving something in return, you necessarily give up some of your rights to privacy and the usage of that money.  See: Food stamps, etc.  The person giving the money isnt trying to control the person receiving it, theyre just trying to make the most effective (morally and economically) usage of their money.

And even if youre arrogant enough to believe youre a better person in some way  smarter, harder-working, more ambitious  since when does being better give you the right to tell other people how to live their lives?
 
But thats not really true.  What you seem to be saying is that in effect people are not responsible for their actions.  Sure, there are a whole bunch of random inheritances I got from my family, including both genes, prenatal health, etc. as well as cultural endowments like being taught to elevate certain behaviors over others, reading, learning, etc. as well as social endowments by being upper middle class.  In so far as any success I have as a direct relationship to these things without any reflection upon my choices and behaviors what you say is true.  But while these things help, they are clearly not the only thing that matters.
 
My mom came to this country when she was in her teens not speaking the language from a small down which didnt have schooling past 5th grade and became a doctor at a time when Women Werent Doctors.  There is a moral difference between doing that and coming from a similar place and not doing that.  One is better than the other, and the reason that it is so is because of the effort and the choices that someone made.  If my mom didnt fight to achieve then it wouldnt have happened.  If she wasnt as smart as she was or had a different temperament or different genes or different parents than it wouldnt happen.   If she was a paranoid schizophrenic then it wouldnt happen.
 
But there still is very clearly a difference.  Somethings are in your control, and you are responsible.  There is a moral dimension, especially when things are more-or-less equal.  If your homeless man is a mentally healthy individual who came from opportunities than, frankly, hes an asshole.  But this example is contrived, because most of the homeless I see (I live in NYC so thats at least 5 before i get to the office every morning) basically should be in an institution where they are fed and sheltered because they are sick, either mental illness or PTSD or something which we are being heartless by letting them suffer on their own.
 
Not everything is in your control; but quite a lot is.  History is not what gives people power, it is a combination of their circumstances and what they do with those circumstances, and thats where some people are better than others.  And by better, I mean better at playing the hands that they were dealt.  And to push the cards analogy further, you see the same faces at the last table of the poker tournaments.  So even if the hands are random, as they are in the games, the way and the skilled with which they are player dominates the results.  Not any sort of random acts of history.
 
So you have proved that you are better at living your live as someone else.  Ok, what gives you the right to tell anyone else?  Well, thats not really the situation.  The other person is asking for money, which means that the other person is not in fact acting independently.  The right of control is given when the person asks.  If they didnt ask for anything, then there is no right.  The right basically stems from the fact that the person who has the money or is giving something away is obligated to act morally; they are responsible for their actions.  And if giving you money encourages you to do something immoral or wrong, like say killing yourself with drugs (I actually dont care about drugs but when you are in a liquor store watching a homeless guy buy thunderbird in nickels and dimes and the guy behind the counter says something about needing to have their medicine you wonder who those assholes are who enable them to wallow in the street rather than say housing and feeding them), well, you cant shirk the responsibilities of your action having consequences.  And thats where the control imperative comes from.

I guess the point is: until I give it away, it is still my money. So if I am going to invest in a human, Id prefer to do it in a way that doesnt lead to more self destruction. I give money to things like the local food bank, and other local city projects that. If folks are really hungry, they know where to go.
 
Another way to look at it: a friend is in need of some money. Lets say health problems took their toll, and he or she is in the middle of rebuilding their life. While, I would support them in getting some improved quality of life over just simply surviving, I would not gift them money if they could barely pay their rent, and they are out buying the latest and greatest iPhone and skipping off to LA.
 
Ill gladly give me money away to help folks survive, but otherwise my extra money is for MY luxury, not theirs. So, I guess it is a pecking order. Someone elses survival, should be more important than my luxury, but your luxury will rarely, if ever, trump mine.

Are you really helping someone by feeding their habit?
 
Heres an idea: if theres a restaurant or food shop not too far from where you are, ask the person if theyre hungry and offer to buy them lunch / dinner. If its cold outside a soup and sandwich, or a meatball sub, can help.

i think there are few things at play here:
 
there will always be poor people.
 
there is a difference between being broke and being poor.
 
i agree with aaron that we should help other people because they are people.
 
being a person, however, does not mean that you deserve anyones help. if anything, its the other way around: being a person means you have a responsibility to help other people.
 
helping other people does NOT ONLY mean giving them money.
 
therefore, i think we have a responsibility to help the poor (and occasionally the broke). how we decide to do it, however, is our freedom.
 
i have never turned down someone asking for help in my city. but then, ive never given them cash, either. i always buy them food, and sometimes will even eat a meal with them.
 
and aaron, i have to agree with Brett: your example was ill-conceived. when you are asking your dad for money, and he says you have to go back to school, he hasnt removed free will from the equation. you can refuse to go back to school, and he can refuse to give you money. he owes you nothing. and you arent actually controlled by him.
 
turn your equation around. when your son asks you for money, because hes in debt and doesnt have money for beer and prostituteswill you give it to him? and how much? and for how long? somehow it seems youd draw a line somewhere. at some point youll look at your kid and say get a job, im not supporting you anymore. is that controlling his life? or is that simply being an adult?

Can you seriously give a defense of a banking CEO giving himself a multi-million dollar salary and spending it on yachts as a sensible or good use of the time or money of any of the people involved?

Aaron,
 
I think Mr. Baker asked a straightforward question and you completely dodged it.  Id love to know about a banking CEO that giv[es] himself a multi-million dollar salary but that is off-topic.
 
Is control such a bad thing?  Imposing control on some homeless people sounds like a great idea to many people.  At least let them confront their addictions/mental issues, which are the overwhelming problems confronting the homeless, before you let them continue their negative patterns under their free will.
 
What is so horrible about control in general?  Sure, there are a number of parties I would not want controlling me.  There is nothing immoral about subsidizing an activity with some expectations or strings attached.  If you disagree, I expect you would percieve everyone as immoral which you seem to anyway.

I recently had a similar conversation with some friends.  Im kind of with Aaron on this oneI dont base my decision on what I think a beggar will use money for; I spend money on alcohol, so why shouldnt he?  My problem with beggars is that they arent producing anything valuable, so I dont think they deserve my money.
 
I dont give money to people who simply ask for money, but I will almost always drop a dollar in someones hat whos singing a good song.  I feel like hes earned it by lifting my spirit with a song.

Hmm.  I quite felt my dad was correct to say that sort of thing, while I feel differently about people who ask me for money around the courthouse.
 
I guess I felt my dad had some responsibility which meant some right to attempt to use moral suasion, and I trusted my dad.
 
I dont expect a guy who is asking me for money to trust me and I dont feel that responsible for him.
 
Ill have to think more.  Am I enabling or not?  I hope not, but I think about it.  Cant help myself though.  There is the hope it will help if I give money, just as when Ive donated time at shelters to serve food.  One hopes.

what would be the best gift to give to these folks?
 
Why not give them all the gifts you can? Im not sure what day-to-day part-of-your-job interactions programmers have with the poor, I suspect its not much. As an officer in the Navy, many of my sailors families qualified for food stamps. They are a hardy bunch but often at risk of loosing their housing. They didnt have good role models, in fact they often were surrounded by horrible role models. Molestors, drunks, abandoners. Quitters, jailhouse thugs, and the mentally disabled. The mentally disabled may be good people, but theyre bad role models if for no other reason than they are simply not emotionally consistent, reliable, predictable.
 
As a medical student, Ive seen the poor at their lowest. The mentally disabled at their worst: lying, seductive, violent, desperate, confused, fractured  floridly psychotic they call it. One man gouged out his sisters eye for talking back to him while he was raving in the street. Hes schizoaffective. He didnt know. He sells himself as a male prostitute to get money, a trade he learned in jail. But his sister is now also traumatized for life, and her children will no doubt be scarred emotionally, desperately wary of men, mental illness, or both. Ive seen a 40-year-old man come in to the ER to look over his 73-year-old mother whos somnolent and bleeding internally from dead bowel, the arteries clamped off for hours by the vasoconstrictive effect of cocaine. Ive seen a former Senate staffer turned schizoaffective. Why? Chance. Dormant genetics. Not her fault. Struck down from the seat of power at 35.
 
The ones that break my heart are the vets. Id like to know how many scruffy middle-aged men on street corners with cardboard vet signs are actually vets. I suspect most of them are. These were perfectly healthy and intelligent people before something devastated them, mentally, physically, spiritually. Many are travellers: emotionally disturbed, never treated, they wore out their families and were abandoned by the ones they loved. Their wives abandoned them to care for their children and they simply couldnt care for an apparently permanently broken husband as well. They roam from bed to bed, city to city. They favor the grain cars on trains: the long bucket-like cars have welded reinforcements at the ends where the bucket wedges inward at the bottom. The reinforcements form a cave-like structure with a little porch.
 
But before they wandered, before they were abandoned, theyre wrecked psyches made them terrible role models for those children. Who then either sort it out or dont. The outcome probably depends most on the length of exposure.
 
Other vets were never abandoned by their families. They had no families. Unfit for duty, they were discharged and walked across the blue line on the curb, bag in hand. Too embarrassed or unable to go home, they wander.
 
Heroin is an opiate. It relieves pain. Its a favored drug of the poor. Cocaine and meth give the user a feeling of strength, power. The power to meet their fathers expectations. The power to turn the next trick so at least theyll make the rent. Until the money gets spent on the next hit. Alcohol, its a little liquid courage to make a bold step and talk to the girl. We all experience a degree of pleasure in overcoming that little challenge. Unfortunately, it seems a number of alcoholics may actually derive too much pleasure, too much dopamine. They can experience pleasure an order of magnitude greater than most of us. They dont know that. You dont know that. But they quickly associate the liquid courage with the intense pleasurable dopamine payoff, and take to it like fish, with all the expected terrible other consequences.
 
Somewhere in society there is a shift from goods begetting goods to problems begetting problems. The people have so many problems, theres no point in fixing the first one, like a car with too many dents to fix. Children who are born into these broken homes and escape are in a very real way lucky: the random events in their lives added up to shape their decision-making process and early actions in such a way that they accidentally fall across the divide and begin to be net contributors. It is little wonder some of them are revolted by their past and rail against poverty and the poor work ethic of the poor. But its hard to appreciate the flip-side: that theyre the one car that got out of the wrecker derby unscathed. The rest are too dented.
 
Keep in mind, people dont generally live on the street for years. Not truly on the street. Those who run out their welcome at every half-way house, every shelter, they die.
 
On the flip side, there is also a significant value to each of us taking action. In time, money, quantity, quality, adding something to these peoples lives. People turn themselves around. They do. Believe it or not, beggars may be on their way up. These are people who, through mental illness, lack of education, lack of mental capacity, or their own past poor choices are likely living moment to moment. Theyve been forced to admit, probably in the last minute, and maybe 60 times in the last hour, that they have nothing and no way of bootstrapping themselves to even the faintest of goals without some minimum amount of money. At that moment, the moment you are before them, theyre not getting high enough to do the next deed. Theyre not sleeping in the alley. Theyre not beating their kids (those are probably long gone). They might be resigned, they might have been playing trumpet yesterday until they woke up this morning and found their trumpet stolen. In that moment, Ill just about garuntee their plan is not to buy drugs or alcohol or anything except a cab to their sons house to apologize, or to the ER to get paracentesis for their hepatitis. Or food. But they probably are practical and with it enough to realize that you might have cash, but you probably dont have a can of Campbells in your car. And they really dont want anyone throwing a can of Campbell at them. The coins and their feet hurt plenty enough. They might be asking for money, but in truth theyre asking for something. Anything. Please.
 
What value system seriously argues against charity?
 
Give to poor. There but for the grace of chance go you.

And not just that one illiterate person you passed this morning  you (personally) have to teach all of them, because they all need it.

I usually dont give money to anyone that I dont know.  I dont give money to charities.  Through my life I usually havent had a lot of money to give money to help street beggars, although sometimes it tugs your heart strings to see them.  And from the statistics, most people a NOT mentally handicapped or drugged up.  What they are is mothers with little children, veterans, people like you and I who were doing just fine one day and the next they lost the job, their marriage, their health, their house.  What I do, if someone is in distress, is to lend a hand.  I usually help someone (even a stranger) who is stranded with a flat tire.  I have, several times, given a ride to a hitch hiker.  I usually open the door for the person behind me.  If a someone is depressed or has lost loved one, I linger a little to see if they need someone to listen.  If a person is been overwhelmed, I have babysat for an afternoon or helped clean their house.  If someone is beaten from a spouse, I listen to them and offer some counsel, or a place to stay if they seem they need that.  One time a coworker was in fear of his job, so I went to the boss to try to keep his job (didnt work).  Another person, who was in pain, needed me to drive her to the doctor.  I payed for the doctors bill because he wouldnt see her without payment.  So far, the people that I have known, most of them didnt seem to want handouts, they just want some kindly and thoughtful advice, a job, someone to talk to, a way to make it, a little respect.  Everything you do has an effect on someone else.

Title: Money and Worth
 
The streets of San Francisco are lined with poor people looking for a
little spare change. Many different strategies are tried  some just
shake a jar, others call for help, some make specific small requests,
and a fellow I saw today just kept sunnily repeating a nickel and a
smile will last a long while in an endearing tone. Others, however, try
to earn their keep  playing music, doing tricks, selling special
papers like Spare Change.
 
I have a strong urge to help out the first group, those who simply ask,
but helping the second has always struck me as odd. People tell me that
its better if the poor receive their money by doing work, because it
lets them retain some dignity, but Ive never quite bought that. After
all, how much dignity do you get when your income comes from people
patronizingly pretending to buy a newspaper specially created for this
ruse?
 
But theres a much more serious problem with only giving the poor money
for doing things. It encourages them to think their worth as a person is
defined by their success in the capitalist economy.
 
Now there is a grain of truth to this delusion. There are many useful
jobs for which society can compensate you. (Although even that, frankly,
requires a level of non-useful skill at fitting into the general
capitalist system.) But thats about it. There are many useful jobs that
society doesnt compensate well. There are many useful people who cant
do any of those jobs because society never trained them or gave them the
opportunities required. And even if, perchance, there existed someone
who cannot and even with training and opportunity could not do anything
useful, it seems clear to me that their simple existence as a human
being endows them with some inalienable value. (If human beings didnt
have value, then we would have no one to do useful things for.)
 
People on the street dont deserve our money because they can pretend to
do certain menial jobs. Nor should their sense of dignity be bound up in 
doing them. Instead they, like everyone else, deserve our money because
they are people and if we cannot care for other people, then we have
precious little else.

I completely agree that the Street Spirit / Spare Change delusion doesnt really help anyone, and that it is simply better to help a fellow denizen out of the goodness of the act.
 
Lets not throw this  upon the capitalist pyre just yet.  Having a reason to get up in the morning and a way to contribute to society, whether for financial, social or personal gain, to feel that you matter in some way, to some one,  is all weve really got, so the real question is how to you provide baseline subsistence so people dont have to make the motions of contribution and not require, but rather encourage a rich, active, not necessarily capitalist life.
 
Ive got no answers.

People dont deserve our money. Human beings, however, do deserve our respect as human beings. Equating respect with giving them money is, if I am reading this entry correctly, your mistake.
 
I think the direction your thoughts take on this sound very much what I understand co-dependence to be. Most peoples situations are of their own making. If you insist that there is now way you can know what they have been through, I would half agree with you, but I would also point out that assuming that they have no control over their lives is condescending and says how little you think of them.
 
They deserve a chance, they deserve a break, they deserve opportunity, they deserve real hope that can actually bear(bare?) success. Unfortunately, if handouts to someone in your home-town compares to the global handouts to places like Africa, I think the current zeitgeist is that we are learning that handouts of any sort tend to be destructive.

heres the problem:
 
weve made this a moral discussion.
 
it is well within your moral rights to simply donate money to people on the street without expecting anything in return.
 
and it is certainly a moral thing to recognize the innate value in every human being.
 
but it is impractical to start assuming that just because the action is moral, means that you have to do it all the time.
 
if you made it mandatory for yourself to walk through the city each evening and gave $20 to every beggar you saw, youd be making a moral decision. and a positive one at that.
 
but how long do you think youd survive on what you had left? my guess is youd end up begging on the street yourself before too long. how does that help them, really?
 
i think giving money to the poor is good. but i think there are other things that can be done that are even better: where i live, i sometimes help out RIFA, a charity that offers free computer classes, job placement services, a food bank, temporary lodging, and a host of other services aimed directly at helping people lift themselves out of poverty.
 
maybe thats fanatically capitalistic of them.
 
or maybe theres more to helping the poor than tossing cash at them.

Aaron, you write like someone who has been much loved in his life.
 
This is, sadly, more the exception than the rule.
 
if we cannot care for other people, then we have precious little else.
 
Thats a laudable sentiment, but it doesnt pay the rent, buy food, get medical care, etc.
 
Its also unconvincing to anyone who isnt already convinced (to a good approximation).

I recently spent some time in San Francisco.  I was amazed at the number of people giving money to beggars.  I even saw a man give his daughter a dollar bill to take to the panhandler to put in his hat.
 
In London this is much less common.  Although it does still happen (otherwise we wouldnt have beggars).
 
Westminster City Council and The Big Issue (our very successful equivalent of Spare Change) recently ran a large advertising campaign asking Londoners not to give money to homeless people begging on the street 
 
Are you killing with kindness?  The money you give to those who beg may actually keep them on the streets. In some cases you may be helping them buy drugs that could kill them.  http://www.killingwithkindness.com/
 
I think the idea of the Big Issue (and Spare Change?) is that they vet sellers of the paper in some way so that you can be a lot more sure that your contribution is  constructive (as long as you make sure you are buying from a badged vendor).
 
On a personal note I havent given any money to beggars since I gave five pounds to a young man with a convincing line about needing to get into a hostel for the night whom I saw shooting up later the same night.

Equating respect with giving them money is, if I am reading this entry correctly, your mistake.
 
Thats pretty much what I was thinking.
 
Id say another mistake is thinking theres anything simple about asking for money. It takes a lot of persuasive skill to convince people to give. Whether its asking or singing, youre rewarding a performance either way. The former group is just so talented at performing that it looks effortless to you.

I think that simply giving money to people on the street is not the best use of resources.  Gifts and other sporadic donations to homeless/jobless folks, regardless of need, doesnt seem to address the structural issues that put them on the street in the first place.  As mentioned, the sporadic and completely undependable frequency/quantity doesnt leave much room for Tomorrow, only Now.
What concerns me is that if we enable these individuals to remain on the street, how do we move them from the street to a self-sufficient/supported lifestyle?
 
That isnt to say, Epic Fail because they havent succeeded in the capilatlist economy and therefore should be ignored, or allowed to freeze in the street [I suppose that isnt such a problem in San Fran as Toronto?].
 
Resources, which are most likely hard to find, or already stretched to the limit, are, in my opinion, a better use of the money which may otherwise end up in the hands of street beggars; food programs, accessible housing, out of the cold [or the equiv. for you tropical folk], job search/creation services, and many more.

I agree though while structural solutions are absent, I see nothing wrong with sporadic giving - even if the receiver sometimes puts the gift to unproductive use.

Chad: Does anyone actually say Hmm, I could give some spare change to this fellow, or I could donate it to a nonprofit working to solve the structural problems that cause homelessness? I doubt it. I think most people could easily do both.
 
That said, Id love to hear recommendations for San Francisco and Boston groups addressing structual causes of homelessness to donate to.

Title: Slaves of Some Dead Sociologist
 
Imagine you were suddenly put in charge of Google. What would you spend your time doing? Branding? The Google brand is pretty important, but its not really something you can control directly; its more of a side-effect of the other decisions you make. (If your legal team decides to give up the names of Chinese dissidents to the secret police, thats going to hurt your brand.) Product design? Clearly this is also important, but at a company the size of Google its too big a job for one person  most of Googles innovative new products are designed by rank-and-file engineers. Strategy? This is a good one, and probably what Googles current rulers spend most of their time on, but Im skeptical as to how good anyone can really be at long-term strategy with such a huge company. Hiring? Obviously hiring is pretty important, but even the greatest group of people arent going to save your company if they waste their time once their inside.
 
No, I think the most important thing a person in charge of a large company can work on is sociology  designing the social structure of the company. Its the sociology that determines who gets hired, what their life is like, how much freedom they have, what sorts of things they work on, etc. Clearly these structures determine an enormous amount about the corporation. And yet, strikingly, Ive never heard of a single corporation that has a high-level group devoted to studying and improving them.
 
Practical men, Keynes famously wrote at the end of his General Theory,  who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. And sociology seems to have worked out much the same way. Chandler claims that the modern command-and-control corporation was worked out just about identically by several different people around the same time and its military methods have been with us ever since.
 
Despite enormous changes in the kinds of things big companies do as well as in the way that they do them, the actual structure of the large corporation (with very few exceptions) has hardly changed at all. Its gotten to the point where even tinkering with the cubicle seems radical.
 
Since such questions are so alien, let me give a sense of the questions I mean. For example, how do you hire? Right now, it appears that at Google each team gets to hire people for its projects and then once youre inside Google you get to switch to another project if you like. Why not have a team dedicated to hiring which tries to find the best way to pick the best people as well as making sure they match a particular company culture?
 
Also, how do projects get picked? Do you have a command-and-control structure deciding what things need to get worked on from the top? Do you let everybody work on what they like? Do you let the company vote on what its priorities should be?
 
What do you do with people who dont work out? Do you have performance reviews? Bonus pay? Three-strikes firing offenses? Or do all these systems just make working more frightening and problematic?
 
It seems to me any reasonable company ought to have a whole department dedicated to working on these issues, studying the systems that are in place, studying the kinds of things that others have tried, and doing their own experiments to see if they can do things better. And yet, to my knowledge, no one does. Even the handful of companies that do something innovative with their corporate structure did it as a one-off  they have no team dedicated to coming up with and trying new such innovations.
 
Now normally when you discover that everyone else is doing something wrong, theres an opportunity for you to get ahead by doing it right. But thats much more difficult here, because these questions only really make sense for large organizations and very few of us find ourselves in charge of large organizations. For example, its arguable that Fog Creek has done some things along these lines, but its pretty difficult to tell since theyve never had more than a couple dozen people.
 
Instead, the real innovation hasnt come from companies, but the online peer-production projects, like GNU/Linux, that take contributions from a distributed set of volunteer contributors. But such groups solve the problem largely through eliminating it  they dont have to worry about who to hire and how to treat them because they dont hire anyone.
 
Instead, most of the people who work on GNU/Linux are hired by other companies where they must contend with the antiquated social structures that those companies provide. And since those are the brutal facts that most humans must contend with, it would be nice if more people were thinking about alternatives.

This probably gets lumped into the strategy category a lot.
 
There is a lot of variety in corporate structure. Goldman Sachs is a (recently and historically successful) example, their organization does not have many levels of management, Usually there have been no more than two layers to the top from http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?pid=411146&tab=25&agid=2
 
Another strategy is Napoleon style decentralization, which is not new obviously, Walmart got a lot of praise for its hurricane Katrina response, compared to FEMA which is organized more conventionally.
 
A major demotivator is risk. The more risk a company takes the more expensive capital is, so the more money they have to make to stay afloat. I think there are a lot of people out there that are happy just to have a decent job that pays the bills.

aaron,
 
most people who get to in charge of large organizations are very focused and have lots of energy, and have spent their whole lives proving it. Then they get those first couple of really big jobs  dean, president, whatever, and their same I-will-be-the-one-to-fix-it attitude cant let them believe they cant change the culture of the place. A year or two later, most of them admit they failed to change the culture of the institution and they try to recover and make some small, focused changes. I have seen it happen again and again. Most often the ones who do manage to make a change tend verge on luck: the right ambition in the right job at the right time. The bottom line is, no matter how important the CEO is, hes not very important compared to 10,000 other people. Hes just not. The best ones, I think, have been the ones who dug in and made changes at the funding level, but I have also seen such folks taken down by bitter infighting.
 
As for the experimentation: what do you think the Human Resources department does? The popularized employee interface with HR as an employee is the interface a rat has with the scientist: youre in the experiment. The HR senior management, especially in larger organizations, is in the role of scientist. Ive run the data on some of those experiments.
 
As for alternatives, check out Chris Algyris and some of the industrial efficiency experts. These people were driven by data and I think youll find that their best insights have been overlooked by the easy-to-understand ideas that got popularized, much to their authors chagrin.

Ive also been thinking quite a lot recently about what it takes to build a great/lasting company.  I sort of got stuck on the hiring good people part, because to me even that is a quite difficult task.  Everyone is motivated and excited by different things, and the best people are harder to motivate and excite than others, so finding and keeping them is a daunting task.
 
Having a team of people asking the questions you discuss here is a brilliant idea.

Title: Welcome, watchdog.net
 
As youve probably noticed, its political insanity season in the US. I can hardly go outside these days without running into someone complaining about the latest piece of campaign gossip. Ive mostly tried to keep it off this blog, but its hard to not get swept up in the fever. As someone who wants to make a difference in the world, Ive long wondered whether there was an effective way for a programmer to get involved in politics, but Ive never been able to quite figure it out.
 
Well, recent events and Larry Lessig got me thinking about it again and Ive spent the past few months working with and talking to some amazing people about the problem. Ive learned a lot and must have gone through a dozen different project ideas, but I finally think Ive found something. Its not so much a finished solution as a direction, where I hope to figure more of it along the way.
 
So the site is called watchdog.net and the plan has three parts. First, pull in data sources from all over  district demographics, votes, lobbying records, campaign finance reports, etc.  and let people explore them in one elegant, unified interface. I want this to be one of the most powerful, compelling interfaces for exploring a large data set out there.
 
But just giving people information isnt enough; unless you give them an opportunity to do something about it, it will just make them more apathetic. So the second part of the site is building tools to let people take action: write or call your representative, send a note to local papers, post a story about something interesting youve found, generate a scorecard for the next election.
 
And tying these two pieces together will be a collaborative database of political causes. So on the page about global warming, youll be able to learn more about the problem and proposed solutions, research the donors and votes on the issue, and see or start a letter-writing campaign.
 
All of it, of course, is free software and free data. And its all got a dozen different APIs to make it easy for others to build on what weve done in their own work. The goal is to be a hub, connecting citizens, activists, organizations, politicians, programmers, and everybody else whos interested in politics.
 
The hope is to make it as interesting and easy as possible to pull people into politics. Its an ambitious goal with many pieces and possibilities, but with all the excitement right now we want to get something up as fast as possible. So well be developing live on watchdog.net, releasing pieces as soon as we finish them. Our first goal is to put up data about every representative and a way to write them.
 
Ive managed to find an amazing group of people willing to help out with building it so far. And the Sunlight Network has encouraged me and graciously agreed to fund it. But we still need many more hands, especially programmers. If youre interested in working on it, whether as a volunteer or for pay, please send me an email  me@aaronsw.com  telling me what youd like to help with.
 
We only officially started work yesterday, so theres not much up yet, but hopefully itll give you a sense of where were going:

If youre looking for a possibly useful idea:
 
At one point I was trying to determine what the current set of laws were. Unfortunately, I couldnt find an up to date version of say the constitution - because politicians approve bills that perform changes like:
 
take word 4 of the constitution section A, and change it to thee
 
It might be useful to turn these bills into DIFFs, and treat these documents are initial versions - that way youd be able to see the growth of federal documents.

I always thought it would be useful to have a site track promises (and forecasts) made by politicians.
 
If someone makes a promise or boldly asserts something, it would be nice to make an entry into a website which was attached to a timer event, so that at the designated point in the future, the event surfaces up to anyone interested enough to subscribe to the data stream for that politician or topic.
 
From there, some sort of voting system could make the more interesting ones bubble to the front page.
 
There are a lot of reasons why this would be useful, but Ill keep this post short: you want to keep politicians honest, and you want to give the populace a better long term memory. Maybe this will cause politicians to stop optimizing for the short-term.

It might help to have the right expectations going in. Maybe all Aaron should focus on is extracting and presenting data, at least to start.
 
I think any software that makes political action easier should be on a different site. Even if its heavily linked into watchdog.net via widgets or an API. It just seems a bit disjoint to be the same website whats next, a social network? Its too much for one site, and they should be spread out.
 
It also means that if the programmers of this political action site fall to cynicism, the main data representation site is unscathed.

Title: Banff
 

 
When you step off the plane in Calgary, there are, rather improbably, men in cowboy hats. Albertans consistently refer to their province as the Texas of Canada and apparently its largest city has taken the notion to heart.
 
I take a ride with a man who appears to have spent his life preparing to be the consummate businessman. His handshake is firm, his knowledge of geopolitics impeccable. He is a master of the telling anecdote, the commanding voice, the comprehensive but guarded answer. He has built planes, been in bands, managed corporate strategy, and now he is on assignment in Mexico, where he must staff up a factory to build planes for a Canadian business that is wary of such offshoring.
 
He has gone, he explains, from a life in which he researches technicalities for position papers on corporate strategy to one life in which he gets up every morning, drives to a factory, locks the doors (to punish latecomers), walks the line, and tries to figure out how to get airplanes built and delivered.
 
As we drive, he demonstrates his radio contact to the folks back home in Mexico. Right now they are trying to figure out how to get a plane body they have built from Mexico to Canada in time for additional construction to begin on Monday morning without breaking any laws in the complicated patchwork of trucking regulations.
 
I feel endlessly inferior to this confident man of business, until I discover he knows very little about technology or copyright law. He does understand, however, that Google must be very popular, as he visits it at least two or three times a day. I try to contribute something back by attempting to explain some things about the subject, although I talk too fast and dont explain enough, so Im not sure much was clear.
 
It is a long drive past a short skyline to Banff, a city that literally resides inside a national park, one which requires a permit to enter and in which no new construction is permitted.
 
Tourism most certainly is, however, and the city is dotted with hotels and conference centers nestled into the sides of imposing mountains, with glorious vistas in all directions. The hotel I am staying at is almost comically opulent, with a Roaring 20s theme of sparkling black gowns amidst weak white art deco lights. My room is huge.
 

 
At check in I am given my badge and binder and hat and vest. There is a party that night at the bar. I want to soak up the discussions, to see how the elite live and what they discuss, but I am too shy to barge into any of the conversations. It is just like any other party: I sit against the wall and try to remain inconspicuous.
 
The next morning I am scheduled to give a brief talk to this self-described group of young leaders of Canada. Taking the stage after the platitudes of a high-ranking Albertan government official, I find myself on a panel on the Internet and Mass Collaboration (the one technology panel at the conference) and am asked to give five minutes of provocative thoughts. In a bright red t-shirt amongst a sea of suits, I approach the podium:
 
I suppose Im here to be the brash young person from San Francisco. Ill try my best to fill that role. For years Ive been a user and a builder of these technologies. Most recently, I co-founded Reddit, a democratic news site which was purchased by the magazine publisher Cond Nast, and I am now working on Open Library, an attempt to create a Wikipedia for books. []
 
Theres a lot of talk, here and elsewhere, about how Internet collaboration is going to revolutionize business and politics. Just add some Internet collaboration, they say, and your business will suddenly start working better and smarterand cheaper, as well. But the Internet is not this magic pixie dust you can sprinkle on anything. In the States, the back of every ketchup bottle now has a notice explaining that you can now create your own advertisements for the ketchup company. In return, well, in return they might use your ad. This is magic pixie dust thinking at work: people are not going to suddenly start designing your ad campaigns for you just because you asked them to.
 
We have to remember that these things are done by real people, not magical abstractions. The rhetoric often suggests that some magical force of peer production or mass collaboration has written an encyclopedia or created a video library. Such forces do not exist; instead there are only individual people, the same kind of people who drive everything else.
 
The power is that these people are collaborating. But they are collaborating because they have come together to form a community. And a community works because it has shared values. But heres the thing: these shared values are profoundly anti-business. [Laughs from the audience.] I mean, look at Wikipedia. This is a group who wakes up every day and tries to put the encyclopedia publishers out of business by providing a collection of world knowledge they can give away to everyone for free.
 
If you want someone to do your companys work for you, finding a well-organized online community with strong anti-business values seems like a bad idea. [Laughs.]
 
So what do you do? I have a friend who is even more brash than I am and when anyone asks her for business advice she tells them simply: Well, in the future, your servants are going to rise up and eat you. So, invest in toothpicks.
 
I quickly scurry back to my seat, afraid this crowd will rise up and eat me for such brazen aggressiveness. But instead, I am cheered with laughter and applause. Nobody ever addresses my toothpicks comment. For the next hour, me and the rest of the panel answer questions from the audience, and I comfortably talk about everything from the gender gap in technology (which, I assure them, is worse than in any other field and a result of the most disgusting discrimination and misogyny) to the future of news (freelancers and aggregators, not institutions).
 
Afterward, and for the next few days, dozens of people come up to compliment me on my talk. So you do this sort of thing a lot then? they all say. I receive three more speaking invitations before lunch and people repeatedly request to sit next to me at meals.
 

 
I spend a great deal of time with Michael Geist and his family. Geist is invariably referred to as the Lawrence Lessig of Canada. A law professor in the countrys capital, he writes a weekly column and gives frequent speeches on technology policy (copyright law, net neutrality, open spectrum, etc.). But unlike Lessig, who has an otherworldly aura of fame about him, Geist is entirely down-to-earth, continually expressing genuine shock at how boneheaded and awful his opponents in industry and government are. While I spend most of the rest of the time explaining things to people, I have to work hard to avoid doing that with Geist  he either knows intimately or has actually worked on every relevant thing I can think to mention.
 
After our panel is a panel on work-life balance, mostly dominated by James Milway, director of the Institute for Competiveness and Prosperity. There are two other women on the panel to balance him, but Milway speaks with such booming confidence and authority that the other panelists comments seem to just disappear. Milway says everything youd expect a right-wing economist to say: Canadians arent working hard enough, theyre not working long enough, they keep spending time doing silly things like increasing the minimum wage and engaging in rent control which are just obviously wrong. Increasing vacation time will just lead to fewer workers getting hired. This is all clear in our regressions. Europes economies are dying; workers there are far unhappier. And so on.
 
Afterwards I go up to him to argue with his economics. Youre using the standard economic assumption that the demand curve for labor slopes downard, I say. (This is economese for the concept that as you raise the cost of hiring someone, people hire less.) But every study on this subject  from Card and Krueger to Michael Manning  finds that this simply isnt the case. Mannings monsopony model, in which you take into account that there are significant costs to changing jobs, finds that all of your results no longer follow.
 
Milway is a fast speaker and has boundless energy and he tries to talk right over me. Everyeveryhold on thereeveryalmost alltheres a strong consensus in economics that raising the minimum wage is a bad idea, he finally gets out. Sure, I say, but theyre wrong  when you actually look at the studies thats just not true. No, theres a strong body of studieseven in our regressions we find that. We argue for a while about the validity of the Card and Krueger work and he finally asks, Whats the argument for the opposite case? Why would employers do that? I try to explain the Manning model but halfway through realize I dont fully understand it. So I switch tacks.
 
Look at what Card found when he was doing his research  employers were happy to raise non-wage benefits to get employees but just refused to raise wages, even when more employees would have made them more money. They werent being economically rational. Well, there you go, he says, as if hes won the argument. If you dont think people behave rationally then were done.
 
But of course people dont behave rationally! I squealed. Look at all the research in behavioral economics  its blatantly obvious people dont behave rationally. Well then, you might as well throw away the whole field of economics! he shouted. Precisely. Im glad you agree  economics is bogus. He just laughed and stormed off, but not before giving me a working paper from his institute.
 
We ended up sitting near each other at lunch. He was explaining that his institute was completely funded by the Ontario government but remained strictly independent. So howd you get the government to fund a right-wing think tank? I asked. He laughed. Well, normally Id say were more middle-of-the-road, but I guess youre right, we are pretty right-wing. I dont know. Harris [the previous major premier of Ontario] started us but [the current one] loves us too.
 

 
That night there was a talk by Rory Stewart, the other person I got to know and enjoy at the conference. Stewart is an amazing fellow. An incredibly handsome man, with a perfect British accent and the most well-tailored suits, he nonetheless has the look of something otherworldly about him. His face is pulled back and marked as if hes seen things no one in a suit that nice was meant to see. I adored him from the first.
 
He somehow got it in his head to walk across Afghanistan and his talk consisted of photos and descriptions of this incredible journey. he begun in a major city and walked for years, depending almost entirely on the hospitality of strangers in each town to keep him alive and moving. He walked every day, through deserts and snowstorms, with company and without. And what he found was an incredibly kind people, living in terribly poor conditions in autonomous villages, with a passionate faith in their religion (including such rules as keeping women out of site).
 
Stewart now runs an NGO in Kabul, which is doing the work that the coalition forces in the country found too low-priority to do: clear seven feet of garbage from the streets, build thriving businesses and shops in the downtown district, and prepare commercial products for import and export. Stewart spoke bluntly about the military mission and the government, suggesting it was unlikely to do much good.
 
It was 11pm by the time the discussion was over, so I went straight to bed.
 
The next morning was dedicated to addressing the most pressing issue in foreign policy, perhaps overall: whether we should bring the troops home instead of continuing to lose their lives maintaining an increasingly violent occupation in a country we originally invaded under the guise of fighting terrorism but in which we now remain because we fear it will fall apart if we will leave. This being Canada, that country is Afghanistan.
 
The day started with a passionate speech by the Afghanistan Minister for Education, who pleaded for us to let the country take control of its own affairs and to ensure its greedy neighbors (widely agreed to be a euphemism for Pakistan) didnt destroy it.
 

 
Then there was a star-studded panel, including Rory Stewart, an Afghani PR officer, an Afghani citizen, the head of the entire Canadian Army, the ambassador from Afghanistan, and the head of a Canadian government development agency. (I dont have the list in front of me, but I believe thats correct.) It was pretty impressive to see the head of the Canadian Army and he was a pretty impressive fellow, equally fluent in literature and philosophy as politics and warfare. But he steadfastly refused to take a position on whether the army should remain in Afghanistan, insisting that was a question for the population through their government. Stewart cleverly began the panel by saying that everyone in it had vested interests, including him, and that we should work hard to try to derive the truth from their statements.
 
At lunch we hear the most amazing presentation. Its a pitch for, I am not making this up Development-In-A-Box(TM)  a system that (again, I am not making this up), uses preconfigured solutions  embedded in business processes  automating compliance  [with] fully automated  wireframes. (And thats just the part I managed to record  the rest of it was far worse.) The presentation was complete with completely absurd PowerPoint clip art: a cargo crate flying to world hotspots, a hammer and sickle flying over a tank riding over an AK-47 pointed at a pile of Chinese-made goods, all above a 3D banner reading Less Clausewitz, More Sun-Tzu.
 
Adding to the sense of unreality, the speaker sounded like a broken animatronic Abe Lincoln, placing bizarre emphasis on random words and constantly speaking in a faux-upbeat tone.
 
The gist of the proposal was this: come up with a bunch of computer programs and simple rules that can be followed in any country, no matter how badly destroyed, to get its economy up and running so that investors can come in and start taking advantage of it. It was a reasonable idea, he explained, to get the economy started before a democratic government was because that was how history had usually proceeded  after all, the US only let everyone vote like fifty years ago.
 
I swear, I would have been convinced the talk was given by the Yes Men if it wasnt quite so bad. Even so, we were half-convinced it was some kind of prank. At least now I understand why businessmen kept falling for the Yes Mens pranks. (To be fair, there was a bunch of pushback. Not the least of which came from Rory Stewart, who pointed out that entering a wide variety of countries with pre-written rules might not be spectacularly effective.)
 
There was also a group photo in the mountains and some scheduled trips around town, but I neglected to bring a jacket so I mostly stayed inside the hotel, luxuriating in my oversized room and using my overpriced Internet connection. But soon enough it was time to catch the bus back to Calgary, and then to gritty, working-class San Francisco and the literal view from the ground, not the metaphorical one they need up in the mountains.

If you want someone to do your companys work for you, finding a well-organized online community with strong anti-business values seems like a bad idea. [Laughs.]
 
It SEEMS that way. Which is why theres a whole cadre of clever men (and a few token women) who essentially sell consulting gigs on how to do exactly that, and what techniques of marketing and emotional manipulation work best towards that goal. The basic trick is running the business harnessing some sort of resentment. Like how right-wing talk-shows hosts who are corporate shills claim to be speakers for the downtrodden.

Title: Review: The New Ruthless Economy
 

 
During the boom years of the New Economy nineties, new technologies led to a boost in productivity and profits. But over the same period, compensation for actual workers stayed the same or even went down. In this book, Simon Head investigates the other side of technology: the way it keeps the average worker down.
 
Head finds that scientific management  the system that turned assembly lines into sweatshops in the 1880s  has expanded to conquer the service sector as well. Where old management consultants reorganized factories to deskill workers (by making them repeat mindless jobs over and over) and regulate behavior (by having overseers and stopwatches making sure they met their quotas), new management consultants reorganize call centers to deskill workers (by having them simply read scripts off a computer screen) and regulate behavior (by having their computers measure how long they spend on the phone and at lunch and in the bathroom).
 
But its not just call centers: Head finds the same technological reengineering of business in everything from factories to doctors offices, where HMO-enforced policies require doctors to do little more than type symptoms into a computer and prescribe the recommended treatment, with little time to investigate what might actually be wrong with the patient.
 
Heads argument is much like that of David Noble in Forces of Production: we had a choice about how to use new technology. We could use it to turn employees into ever-more-skilled craftspeople, allowing them to be more effective and creative in their jobs now that they had machines to do their dirty work. Or we could use it to turn employees into faster cogs for a machine, forcing them to follow rigidly-composed scripts carefully specifying their role.
 
We are once again choosing the second. Only this time it may hurt companies, not just employees. At least in manufacturing jobs, you can keep some kind of quality control tracking on the final product. A Toyota may not be very good, but if everyone follows the rules at least they will all be about the same. Service industry jobs require dealing with individual customers in all their messiness. And customers dont make good components in carefully reengineered machines.
 
The result is things like the infuriating 1-800 numbers were all familiar with: incompetent customer support, useless service, uninformed advice. Which means customers walk away. As management cuts costs by outsourcing their call centers  to less and less skilled employees, they also cut profits by alienating their customer base. (Head cites powerful studies by Frederick Reichheld finding that tiny increases in customer retention can lead to doublings in revenue.)
 
Head writes clearly and plainly, although the book lacks the concision of his brilliant pieces for the New York Review of Books (which this book grew out of). And while he does do some on-the-ground reporting, especially from car factories, the book has more of an eye for acronyms than for anecdotes. This is disappointing, because the techniques at the heart of the book (the automated systems for monitoring employees) would make for gripping reading, yet Head never gives us a glimpse of what they actually look like in practice.
 
For those with only a little time, the key chapter (6) is available online [PDF]. For those who want to dig deeper, I can recommend two related books from the same year: Christian Parentis The Soft Cage goes into more detail about surveillance technologies in all areas of life while his friend Doug Henwoods After the New Economy goes into more detail about the economic numbers behind such things.

What nonsense. Its more bothand than eitheror. And there arent only two alternatives.
 
The new technologies dont JUST deskill us, they also reskill/overskill us among a myriad of other things.
 
Also its one of the first fields (music/art/play aside) that welcomes participation from kids without getting too pejorative about it. It also welcomes interaction with geezers and
 
Better luck next time.

How about people skill themselves? Why is it the responsibility of employers to provide their unmotivated workforce with skills?
 
I think these new systems are being used because they work, not because it is an evil scheme to dumb down the workforce. Anybody who doesnt like it is free to pursue alternative careers, or found a business that uses a different technology.

Scientific Management has been in and out of vogue since Taylors  The Principles of
Scientific Measurement (1910).  It was low hanging fruit to many industries and in some cases still is.  For instance this current article on farming in Africawhere planting crops in rows is a radical innovation!
 
That micromanagement isnt an improvement in some industries is a human issue and not a political one.  Everyone tinkers at the corners and successful people are imitated by others.  Toyota was a bad choice of example on your part because the Japanese adopted more flexible assembly line methods that invented by an American and eventually reimported.  As one of my friends puts it Americans make great Japanese cars.
 
Scientific Management has the most punishing effects at the national scale.  Socialism has been a failure on everything larger than a personal size (300 Amish villagers: works, 30mil French nationals: doesnt).
 
You may think this is just because the right ideas havent got top billing.  But how do you know which ideas are right?  and how can we elevate the right people to implement those ideas?
 
In dictatorships the people who are the most ruthless rise to the top - and not the people with the best ideas.  In democracies the people who campaign best rise to the top - and not the people with the best ideas.
 
You want the people to want the best ideas - which happen to match your own.  Now weve boiled it down to a people problem and as an engineer you should know that people problems are hard.    Not insurmountable, but harder than technical problems.  The last couple PyCons solved the hardest py3k issues at the bar than during sprints because the hardest issues were people issues.

The whole tone of this seems to imply that once upon a time people had skillful jobs they loved, and that weve now lost this pastoral idyl. Are assembly line jobs worse than working on the field? And more, what proportion of people dont have to do either of these things anymore?
 
Im almost certain that (1) the very worst jobs arent as bad today as they were 100 (or 200) years ago, and (2) the median job is a lot better.
 
The result is things like the infuriating 1-800 numbers were all familiar with: incompetent customer support, useless service, uninformed advice. Which means customers walk away. 
 
I think more accurate would be to say that technology allowed companies to offer a lower level of service than had been possible before (e.g. pre-amazon, there had to be at least someone to take your money at the bookshop, and you could quiz them). So they tried this, and found it saved them money.
 
We all moan about poor airline service, but seldom enough not to fly with the airline. We reveal by doing so that the price were willing to pay for service isnt very high at all.
 
As management cuts costs by outsourcing their call centers to less and less skilled employees, they also cut profits by alienating their customer base. (Head cites powerful studies by Frederick Reichheld finding that tiny increases in customer retention can lead to doublings in revenue.)
 
This is a bit of a blanket statement. No doubt that in some industries service really pays. Thats why little fasion botiques have such attentive (and attractive) staff. But always and everywhere? The gas station off the interstate knows youre never coming back, and behaves accordingly.

Title: The Visible Hand: A Summary
 
What follows is my summary of The Visible Hand by Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.
 
Its difficult today to imagine what American companies were like before the 1840s. They were small concerns, owned and operated by the same person in one location, and focusing on a particular type of product (cotton, provisions, wheat, dry goods, hardware, drugs) and one piece of the distribution chain (retailing, wholesaling, importing, exporting). Their corporate structure (the partnership), accounting techniques (double-entry bookkeeping), and financial instruments (letters of credit) were essentially unchanged from those used by the Italians in the 1390s.
 
Bigger projects were pursued through personal relationships between small firms: family farms had their slaves grow crops, which they sold to the local merchant, who shipped it to his son or nephew in London, who sold it to the local merchants there, and thence to the customers. (At the same time, credit headed the other direction.) As time went on, the number of intermediaries only increased: factors and jobbers and brokers and dealers and commission agents. Coordination was handled through the market.
 
(The one exception was the Bank of the United States, which had branches in many locations and thus could coordinate on something of a national scale. But it was politically unpopular and both the First and Second banks were allowed to expire by Congress.)
 
There was incredible inefficiency, but it mattered little since the technology of the time did not allow for great speed or volume. Canal boats were still pulled by animals, for whom four miles an hour was an impressive speed, and most products (clothing, furniture, clocks, nails) were produced by hand in peoples homes through the putting-out system. There were a handful of textile factories, but since they depended on water-power there was only room for a few of them.
 
All this changed with the railroads, a technological improvement which allowed business to move their products vastly faster. Careful coordination was essential (one didnt want trains crashing into each other), market entry expensive (constructing a railroad line cost a great deal of money), and network effects powerful (a railroad was much more valuable if it could move things all the way across the country).
 
As a result, the railroads built big enterprises, with professional managers to operate them. The businesses were the first to be structured along largely modern lines (the line-and-staff system): a board of directors appointed a professional manager as president, who oversaw a series of vice presidents supervising various company-wide topics (finance, traffic, legal) as well as a general manager. The general manager oversaw a number of divisions, each with departmental managers with profit and loss responsibility and a staff of their own. Each department sent statistics back to headquarters, allowing senior management to improve overall efficiency.
 
In addition to consolidating various different roles into a single organization, the railroads consolidated different organizations into a cartel with a few large players who coordinated pricing schemes and extracted the maximum each merchant was able to pay. The quintessential player in this era of empire-building was the speculator Jay Gould and his nemesis Cornelius Vanderbilt.
 
Gould got his start in 1868 when Vanderbilt attempted to seize control of the Erie railroad, the nearest competitor to his New York Central. Gould succeeded in stopping him and became the Eries largest stockholder and president. He then leased two additional lines and purchased shareholder proxies for two more lines, which he used to vote new directors into power, who then agreed to sell the lines to the Erie. (The courts and legislature quickly moved to stop him and the Pennsylvania seized control of the lines.) He merged with additional lines in Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan, before attempting to corner the market on gold, leading to a stock market crash. The crash forced other lines to sell, but Vanderbilt had more funds and bought them up.
 
Gould had more success in the telegraph industry, where consolidation came even more rapidly. Goulds railroads had contracts with Western Union allowing it to operate telegraph lines along the road. He canceled the contracts and signed agreements to partner with the lines attached to several other railroads. After he bought ocean lines to Latin America, Western Union was scared enough to purchase the competitor. (Gould sealed the deal by offering Vanderbilt, Western Unions largest stockholder, a controlling stake in one of his railroads if he persuaded the board to go through with the purchase.) After the sale, Gould started a new company with the telegraph lines of his remaining railroads, signed several additional deals, and announced plans to build a transatlantic cable. Western Union stock plummeted and Gould bought it up, becoming his competitors largest shareholder. He used this position to persuade Western Union to purchase his competitor at an inflated price and become the controlling member of Western Unions board, a position he used to fend off any future competitors.
 
Theodore Vail played a similar role at AT&T, while local utilities (power, light, heat) ended up being operated by regulated natural monopolies. Soon the nations infrastructure was entirely owned by either public (e.g. the post office) or private (AT&T) monopolies. In each case, it was operated by professional managers who planned and controlled the entire system.
 
The new national infrastructure (railroads, telegraph, steamships, post office) allowed for new national distributors (wholesalers, department stores, mail-order houses, chains) which were themselves organized and managed in the same ways. Department stores, for example, had a manager in charge of each department, with only things like janitors and delivery people shared across the entire store.
 
Such big stores moved to also take the place of wholesalers by building their own distribution networks and, in time, take control of manufacturing as well. Large mail-order houses like Sears Roebuck began building systems of conveyer belts and pneumatic tubes for ensuring orders got assembled promptly  along with systems for punishing those who held the line up. And the geographically-distributed chain stores organized themselves under regional managers who kept tabs on local performance with a team of inspectors.
 
Geographic centralization, automation, and employee monitoring allowed such national concerns to move goods faster, which made them more efficient than the numerous local stores they put out of business. It was economies of speed, not of scale.
 
A similar speeding-up happened in production. The opening of the coal mines provided cheap power for new factories with mass-production machines while railroads provided a market their output. The factories were set up as simple assembly lines operating continuous-process machines, like those built to cut wheat, solder cans, and roll cigarettes. Henry Ford extended this system into assembly with his moving assembly line in which continuous conveyor belts moved parts past the workers. In each factory, managers personally oversaw the line foremen who oversaw each part of the process. By the 1880 census, 80% of manufacturing employees worked in factories, with the putting-out system remaining only for clothing.
 
Fredrick W. Taylor encouraged factories to speed up even further by following his system of scientific management. He proposed a companys lines be run by a planning department which would conduct careful time-and-motions studies to discover the optimal way to carry out each part of the process. Line-level managers would then be responsible for ensuring that individual employees kept producing at the optimal rate. Few followed Taylors recommendations exactly, especially his suggestion to place the planning department in charge of the lines, but many companies adopted his ideas to accelerate their factories.
 
The new speeds, in turn, produced so many products that the national stores couldnt sell them all, leading the manufacturers into distribution and marketing of their own. They began building a regional sales staff, doing national ad campaigns, and buying up competitors. The result was national brands like American Tobacco, Diamond Match, Quaker Oats, Pillsbury Flour, Campbell Soup, Heinz, Borden, Carnation, Libby, Procter & Gamble, and Kodak  most of which remain leaders today.
 
Why did these few leaders achieve such domination? It was not thru their superior technology  they leased the machines they use for assembly. Nor was it their marketing acumen  they all hired professional marketers for the job. And it could not be the power of their brands, for they all invented these brands from scratch. Instead, it was their superior organization that provided the main barrier to entry. Anyone who wanted to compete would have to build their own national network of managers, buyers, and salesmen.
 
And even this was made more difficult for competitors. The first-mover was able to start small, use profits to fund growth, and use the resulting economies of scale to lower prices while expanding nationally. But any competitor would have to start out by competing against this national, low-price network. They would either have much higher per-item costs since they were producing so much less or they would have to borrow enormous amounts of capital to build a high-volume network from the beginning. And who would want to fund such a risky endeavor? Newcomers did appear (Kellogg, Postum, Colgate, Babbitt) but they were rare and the industries remain oligopolies.
 
Industrial products (lumber, petroleum, metal, etc.) also began forming national oligopolies. It started with industry-wide trade associates, which quickly became cartels that conspired to fix prices. However, the incentive to cheat on the cartels by secretly lowering prices was too great and, since cartels were illegal, there was no legal way to prevent it. So companies moved to form trusts, in which one firm would hold in trust the shares of the other firms in exchange for shares of itself. When the Sherman Antitrust Act outlawed trusts, New Jersey stepped in to allow the creation of holding companies  easy-to-establish corporations which simply held the stock of other corporations. But in the early 1900s the courts ruled that even this form violated the law and the companies moved to merge outright, forming a single corporation.
 
But such horizontal integration was rarely very profitable. The real success always came from vertical integration: taking control of suppliers and distribution.
 
Managers who oversaw the factories carefully measured their efficiency. They wanted to maximize the use of the expensive equipment they had purchased, so the repeatedly pushed to speed up the lines and use them more efficiency. This increased efficiency resulted in increased production which resulted in corporate growth which naturally required more lines.
 
At the same time corporations continued this within-industry expansion, higher-level managers saw the generic processes at work and pushed for between-industry expansion: reusing the same management structures and same tools to grow the company and brand into new businesses.
 
And thus, managerial capitalism  the corporate form in which professional managers ran large, national corporation whose owners had at most veto power over their efforts  spread across the country. Their administrative coordination allowed for greater productivity and lower costs, but required a managerial hierarchy which could carry out more functions. The managers also allowed them to increase volume, but also allowed the managers to ensure a permanent place for themselves. The task of management became more technical and specialized and management became separated from ownership. As a result, managers were able to direct the company in ways that favored stability over profits, and the resulting huge enterprises changed the shape of the economy.

Title: Very Good Introductions
 
Oxford University Press has a wonderful series they call Very Short Introductions. The books are small, short, colorful paperbacks with titles like The Brain, Political Philosophy or The Tudors. For each one, the editors find an expert in the field, have them write a brief overview of all the relevant areas of study (thus the book on Globalization covers economics, politics, culture, environment, ideology, and the opposition movement) and edits them to be clear and concise.
 
The result is a very good series of books, and Ive enjoyed them immensely, but its not quite what I want. For one thing, the shortness of the books (theyre usually about a hundred half-size pages) makes them unfulfilling. Its impossible to get a real understanding of a big topic in fifty pages, especially when many of them are taken up summarizing related concerns. (Perhaps you could provide a nice overview of economic globalization in fifty pages, but covering economic, political, cultural, environmental, and ideological globalization in that space is absurd.)
 
And the other is that, however great the editors at OUP, it seems impossible that they would be able to commission the best exposition of every topic for one series. Many of the greatest writers are not going to accept a particular commission, do not approve of some piece of the series style, or perhaps want credit or attention for themselves rather than being just another book in a huge OUP series.
 
So thats why Id like us to put together our own series  not of very short introductions, but of very good ones. These are books which a) try to explain a whole subject with b) clarity and even joy while making c) no strong assumptions of prior knowledge and d) not dumbing the subject down. Its an extremely rare combination  there are many books on subjects that are good but unreadable by the average person, while theres a whole industry churning out pop sci pageturners that communicate little actual knowledge of a subject. But the rare book that actually achieves all four of these goals is a true gem, and ought to be promoted more widely.
 
Please post your suggestions in the comments and Ill try to assemble a list of them next week. Ill go first:
 
Law 101: Everything You Need to Know about the American Legal System by Jay M. Feinman
 
This delightful book goes over the key points of constitutional law, civil procedure, torts, contracts, property, criminal law, etc. with wit, style, and lots of great examples. Sit down not knowing anything about the subject and come away with a clear enough understanding of torts, contracts, and crimes to apply the ideas in your daily life.
 
OK, your turn.

The Story of Philosophy - Will Durant
 
That being said a recommendation that Bryan Magee makes and Ill pass along with philosophy there are between 12 and 22 or so great philosophers and I think youre much better served reading one of their books than reading any commentary on their works.  Many of them are notoriously misunderstood because a secondary text becomes the orthodox reading and then this incorrect interpretation becomes the more powerful meme.  I also find that a lot of introductions to particular philosophers actually make it more difficult instead of less so.  Only when you cant grasp the work of philosopher directly is it really helpful to go to a secondary source and then only in order to get you back to the primary source as soon as you can.
 
So not every realm of inquiry is going to lend itself well to abbreviation.
 
I pretty much avoid intros now except when its a large subject and I dont plan to get very deep in it later.  If I do plan on going deep I just jump right in.

Title: Election Slate: February 2008
 
Being a newly-minted California voter, Ive been looking forward to my opportunity to exercise a little direct democracy tomorrow. (Im not taking a position on whether direct democracy is a good idea, but surely if its there one might as well take advantage of it.) I encourage you to vote as well; indeed, I encourage you to vote the same way I do:
 
Presidential Candidate for the Democratic Party: Barack Obama. Between Mike Gravels inability to get more attention than a passing mention from Wikipedia and everybody else dropping out, the choice is apparently down to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Hillary is the kind of sellout DLC centrist who cozies up to Rupert Murdoch; Barack Obama can hardly be worse. Still, hes sold out too and I vote for him under the illusion that hell somehow revert to his community organizing, Iraq War-opposing, progressive old pre-sellout self sometime before becoming President. False hope springs eternal.
 
Proposition 91: No. So bad, even its supporters are asking you to vote against it.
 
Proposition 92: Yes. Community college is important and previous propositions have been screwing it over for years.
 
Proposition 93: Yes. Progressives seem to oppose term limits, on the grounds that they shift[] more power to the governor and ensur[e] that the State Assembly and the State Senate will be filled with people who lack the experience and institutional history to fight the Sacramento lobbyists (who, of course, have no term limits) (SFBG). Im not so sure, but this seems like a fairly modest proposal which seems to strike a reasonable balance.
 
Propositions 94-97: No. The only people in favor of expanding the casinos while reducing their oversight seem to be their lobbyists.
 
Proposition A: Yes. Parks are nice.
 
Proposition B: Yes. Everyone seems to support this and if police officers want to work three more years, who am I to say no?
 
Proposition C: Yes. I know rationally this is an absurd proposal, but when youre there, in the privacy of the voting booth, looking at whether a geodesic dome should be built on Alcatraz Island, whos going to stop you from voting yes?
 
You should follow me on twitter here.
 
February  4, 2008
 
Dem. Pres.: Obama.  I sure hope he makes it.
 
92: No.  Community colleges are awesome, and need funding, but the way to do this is not by initiative.  All the stupid initiative funding mandates tie the hands of the legislature, and make CAs budget an insolvent inflexible mess. (Id make a longer argument about this, but it would take a few pages)
 
93: Yes.  Good god, the current term limits are stupid.  Too bad that abolishing them altogether wouldnt get the votes.
 
The rest: No.  Theyre all terrible.
 
ABC: Im not from SF, so no comment.

First off, proposition 91 isnt bad.  Its just been passed already in 2006.  Saying its so bad, even its supporters are asking you to vote against it is a complete mischaracterization.  Theres just no point in voting for prop 91 anymore.
 
Regarding Proposition 93, Im not so sure that its is good.  First off, it grants significant extensions to currently serving members of the state assembly and senate.  Second of all, we already have a way of kicking out representatives: its called voting them out.  Why should we punish good legislators by forcing them to leave their jobs for someone wholl be worse?  If we want certain representatives out, vote them out!  Its as simple as that.
 
As for the Obama suggestion, wow do your opinions of him completely mirror mine.  I am also considering reluctantly voting for him.

Title: A Very Speculative Theory of Free Will
 
Title:  How dumb is Swartz?
 
Previously: How Quantum Mechanics is Compatible with Free Will
 
Attention conservation notice: I am well aware that this post will get me called all sorts of silly names and insults (Penrosian apparently the worst among them). For once, I am not going to respond. I just think the theory ought to be published and if you are not inclined to believe it, then feel free to ignore it.
 
The big mystery of the mind is reconciling two things: what we know about the physical structures of the brain and what we experience from day to day as conscious people. The first tells us that our brain is made up of a series of interconnected neurons which fire in response to certain inputs. The second tells us that people have subjective unified experiences and at least the appearance of free will. It seems hard to explain how the first can lead to the second, although theyre obviously connected somehow.
 
So, for example, if were looking at certain visual illusions, we can choose to see them one way or to see them another way. And obviously this choice has some impact on the rest of the brain, especially the part that processes vision. But nobodys been able to find the place in the brain from which such choices originate.
 
I dont know enough about the subject to vouch for it, but this article claims that neurons are small enough that we could see quantum effects in their high-level behavior:
 
The juncture between two neurons is called the synapse.  Each of the perhaps 100 billion neurons in the brain is connected to about 1,000 other neurons.  At the synapse, a firing neuron either passes a neurochemical signal to the next neuron, or it does not pass a signal, with the passing or not passing depending on the complex neurochemistry of the synapse.  If, within a millisecond, a certain number of signals are passed on to a neuron, then that neuron will fire.  Otherwise it will not fire.  Thus what happens at the various synapsessignal passed on or not passed onis the sole determinant of the firing pattern of the neurons in the brain.  The synapses are the control points for our flow of thoughts.
 
The synaptic gap, the gap between one neuron and the next, is quite small, 3.5 nanometers, which is about 35 (hydrogen) atoms.  The sizes of the adjacent parts of the synapse, where much of the neurochemistry goes on, are also small, on the order of 3,500 atoms wide.  Now one of the peculiar effects of quantum mechanics is that if the volume where an atom might be located (the place where the wave function is non-zero) is initially small, it will spread out in time.  One can use Heisenbergs uncertainty principle to show that a calcium ion, for example, will spread out to the size of the synapses (not just the synaptic gap) in about .1 milliseconds (see 8 below).  Neural processes in the brain occur on a time scale of a millisecond, ten times slower than the spread of a calcium ion over the whole synapse.
 
So heres the proposal: a series of entangled quantum particles at the synaptic level allow for coordinated firing patterns which occur in response to choices by our conscious free will. Just as my previous post reconciled free will with statistical randomness, this would seem to reconcile free will with the neuroanatomy.
 
It still seems incredible that there is some high-level coordinated process with its fingers in the quantum effects of our synapses. But we know something incredible is going on because we have subjective experience. So this doesnt seem like much of a stretch to me.

So you are saying our brain has a mechanism to choose which quantum state its in? Thats hard to believe. How could evolution (which acts on a non-quantum level) get a grasp on this process of  jumping between parallel universes?
 
IMO there is no paradox of Free Will versus the mechanics of the brain. There is no Free Will. Its an illusion.

For once Im on Aarons side:
 
For those of you call consciousness an illusion: An illusion is usually thought of as a misperception of reality by some observer.  In other words, reality is in state X, while the observer believes that it is in state Y.
 
If consciousness is an illusion, who or where is the observer that is being fooled?  If Im fooled into thinking that Im conscious, doesnt that make me de facto conscious?

On the quantum thing.
 
There is no need to treat ions and nuclei quantum mechanically in any other model of macroscopic liquid collisions or electrochemistry. Classical theories of electrical conductivity (Debye Huckel theory for example) do perfectly well.
 
In a liquid each ion is surrounded by solvent molecules - the effective container size is much smaller, and therefore the timescales much shorter. But quantum treatment of nuclear motion is not needed at all.
 
In fact, in any chemical process where the atoms involved are bigger than hydrogen, quantum effects on nuclear motions are absolutely negligible. You do need to consider them to get realistic treatments of hydrogen bonding (a H atom bounces back and forth between two O atoms) but nothing bigger than that unless you are looking at very high resolution experiments.
 
The uncertainty principle calculation is a red herring. 1ms is a very very long time, and the Calcium ion will undergo many many collisions in that time, so any spreading of the wavepacket (implicitly, of an isolated ion) is swamped by the effect of collisions. Its just not significant.

I dont know why some people can agree with applying occams razor to almost all other phenomenon we encounter, but then when it comes to their own consciousness they suddenly decide to agree with elaborate theories of quantum entangled microtubules within our brain when its clearly the least probable theory.  The brain is EXTREMELY complex as it is, with MASSIVE feedback throughout, and doesnt require a leap to the QM hypothesis unless you need it for your own speculative reasons.
 
I once tried entertaining this quantum consciousness hypothesis with enthusiasm because if our consciousness is somehow caused by QM effects as Penrose suggests, then that opens up a window of possibility for elevating our souls once again above just an evolved material machine and into the spooky realm of of the quantum.  I dont think that way anymore but we dont have a complete understanding of how brain creates mind yet, and so it still is a possibility, but a very very unlikely one.  Why dont you believe in intelligent design?  Its as likely as the QM consciousness hypothesis.
 
Consciousness, though I would hasten to call it an illusion, is what Minsky calls a suitcase word.  A word which doesnt have any specific definition and has come to represent one thing when in reality it is just an emergent epiphenomenon resulting from many different processes occurring at the same time.
 
What exactly does quantum entanglement add to the brain that could not otherwise be explained without it?

This idea in no way gets around the mind-body problem which has beset all dualist theories since Descartes i.e. how can there be any kind of causal contact between the mind (which must be non-physical to have free-will) and the brain (in your case entangled quantum particles at the synaptic level in Descartes the Pineal Gland)?
 
Penrose to his credit at least admitted that quantum theory was no use as random laws were just as useless as deterministic laws for free-will. What he argued therefore was that some as yet to be discovered property of quantum gravity would allow room for freewill. Francis Crick summarised this argument as follows quantum gravity is mysterious, consciousness is mysterious so one might explain the other Not very convincing is it?
 
But I think anyone who has read anything about this isssue would know most of this. Just for a change how about challenging the other side of the coin i.e. the assumption that we all experience free-will so that there is something that must be explained. Is that really your experience of everyday life? Presumably you work out, save money, have enriching hobbies, are always in a good mood with loved ones, have no bad habits etc etc? If not, why not?
 
Some people seem to think being an evolved, physical creature is a terrible fate but really most of the good things of life only make sense from this perspective. I love my little monkeys because I am a big monkey - its not rational or chosen. A free-will possessed, rational superbeing would be some kind of angel or monster.

And now I have started on the evryday experience of having freewill just use a little bit of introspection. An example I like to use is having a conversation. It is certainly not my experience that a little internal dialogue box pops up with options and I choose what to say, a freeflowing conversation happens too quick. I dont know what I am going to say. In emergencies people often describe themselves as being surprised by what they did. We do not even have very good access to what our brain is doing never mind choose options. What we do have is language to report our internal states but this is at best partial.

Consciousness is an illusion? How is that possible, since illusion presupposes consciousness?
 
Thats a good point. Sounds a bit like: I think therefore I am. It depends on your definition of consciousness (and illusion).
 
What I meant to say is that consciousness has no physical reality. Our consciousness cannot affect physical reality.  It is merely a by-product of physical processes.
 
I wont deny that there is a phenomena of consciousness that we perceive. I just think it exists in some state other than physical reality. I imagine consciousness like an image on a TV screen. Physical Reality (the brain) is the phosphor and electronics of the TV. The image is generated by patterns in the TVs physical state so it does exist in some way, but the image could never decide to be a different image and rearrange the TV atoms. Its a one-way street.

Why do you care about this so much?
 
Ive seen so many very smart people pour so much energy and effort into arguing ad infinitum about the source of consciousness which, as far I can tell, nobody has any theories about how some might prove or disprove. I dont know, and thats fine, because I cant see how either way would change any of my actions in the ways that have real effects on others.

I tend to agree with what others have said about deploying Occam. You suggest our free will modifies firing patterns through a quantum-level mechanism. If our free will is a characteristic of brain activity, surely its more likely to influence directly, at an electro-chemical level?
 
Im not sure the question of free will is a useful one anyhow, Occam again: is the existence of free will necessary for our perception of the thing we call free will? I doubt it, but that leads back into other questions of perception and consciousness.
 
I suspect there is a lot more can be usefully learned about consciousness, as some kind of emergent property at the interface between one complex system (the brain) and another (everything else).
 
I think I can summarise these points with the question: would a brain in a jar have free will?

Youve got the right idea, that its a matter of crazy huge and small scales, but youve got the wrong variables. Entangled quantum states is not a necessary construct. Way too small. Random thermal vibration of molecules, however, is a larger scale effect that can be modeled as a quantum effect (assuming our boy Gibbs has anything to do with it). I suppose youd really need to understand how quantum mechanics gives rise to the statistical mechanical model we call thermal physics.
 
Once you understand that, you need 
1) evolutionary time
2) mesoscale time
3) size of the brain
4) number of synapses in a brain (trillions)
5) number of neurons in a brain (billions)
6) various derivative things, like synapses per neuron, specialization of sets, local and disseminated sets, etc. 
7) fraction of brain not consumed with reptilian tasks
8) Number of and types of machines in neurons: R ribosomes, P protein systems, S second-messenger systems (and S and S and S, etc), nuclear signaling systems, SNRPs, etc. (probably measuring in the thousands).
 
So youve got thousands to millions of transistor-level machines inside each of billions of cells interacting in trillions-raised-to-the-trillions of combinations. Plus lots of specialization in diffuse and local patterns. Floating in a electrodynamic soup. You dont need entangled quantum states. The state of that system is thoroughly complex enough at the molecular/chemical/thermal-physics/statistical-mechanics level.
 
Some of these neurons are just wet half-adders. Some are these sensual, diffuse distributed things that monitor crazy stuff, like system temperature.
 
I think Jeff Hawkins has the right idea. The reptilian brain is sort of a motherboard type of thing and the cortex is a sort of large storage system, which can also be used for virtualization of various additional machines. I think these virtual machines would be the classical brain areas, like Wernickes area, Brocas area, that sort of thing.

You know, on the virtual machine thing  Im sure youve seen the old grids of magnetic balls suspending at the nodes of a wire grid, the first addressable storage? All those cortical neurons are members of similar, highly defined, highly systematic, structures. They dont have names, as I recall, but you could think of them sort of like disk sectors. But theyre arranged in columns. If you unwrap the wrinkled cortex and lay it out like a sheet, and inject a single cortical neuron with some dye, youll see it that dye diffuse to involve a small column (and I think its actually a hollow column, a tube, if you well) of neurons near by. One can imagine the white matter axons underlying these columns could be going to columns and the signal on the axon is designed to query that column and the column has developed through experience in such a way to respond to the stimulus by retransmitting another pattern, perhaps back the way it came, perhaps down another axon, or series of axons. And once a certain series of patterns is replicated and reinforced enough, a stimulus goes to some other extra-cortical area, like the limbic system where you might feel some fear or longing, or from the motor cortex do the basal ganglia and out to the extra-pyramidal systems (extra-pyramidal = (but not ==) extra-cortical: cortical neurons are generally pyramidal in shape).

((my english is not good enough for this - please excuse.))
 
it does not seem too amazing that the idea of free will can be reconciled with neuroanatomy - especially by investigating the process: starting after the intention behind, no matter from which perspective, quantum or magic. ;-) Neither one - free or determined thought -  would be contradictionary to the neuronal transmission, I promise ;-)
 
and the other way round: nothing we will explore on a material level will object free will.
insofar quantums are the best focus.;-)
a huge amount of liberty is still far away from freedom.
 
Randomness possibly seen as maximum of freedom may at any level be the result of/our word for explaining/observing without knowing enough, which again is very probable.
Personally i dislike the word random, as it seems more like our observation of the most effective evolvement system to me: maximum freedom, but within a system : no goal + evolvement energy + the system or ist initiation.
No goal is as close as possible to free will: we can choose (the goal) within the system. 
And now again, maximum evolvement would actually be what i would invent if i was almighty and bored/courious ;-)
(we are certainly not (yet) the observers of the whole illusion - but that is no argument against illusion.)
personally i would not call it an illusion  i would call it a possible, relational and restricted experience 
(@being lucky: this is truly a question in strong relation to ones thoughts, which are related to chemical processes too: while thoughts can go down in a spiral to depression or be depressive by birth reasons they can be enabled to be cured chemically, because of the material relation  how great.
So in general: you will always and everywhere find the relation between biology, chemistry, physics  material. Thats the relation, the restriction-and though possible freedom of our consciousness ;-)
consciousness as result of evolution (again i prefer evolvement) is still a creative power - so it seems likely that there is a creative power behind evolution - as it is ongoing creation (random or determined)  but it simply does not necessarily assume a TARGETED creator.
so THIS seems to be the question and the answer to my little brain: if there is/would be a goal - it is/would be determinism, if not - it is, restricted by birth,challenge/reaction/power,time and death: something like free will :-)
(not too free, uh? :-)) 
(nothing seems to be targeted, actually, except evolvement to higher level itself as purpose: which again, to be most effective, demands the illusion of free will for creative consciousness, which again allows to avoid too - so this IS free will (including insecure outcome) then. (not too free again, as any choice has consequences  and most humans are aware of this  without knowing the outcome for sure, they do know an individually different amount of unified relations possibilities restricted by fear of anything  but free will)
so i do personally replace free will with free choice and will based on values
if there is a creative power behind evolution we simply cant answer the question of free will, because it is the wrong question, admittedly an important one though - it is a question of what dimension we discuss.
which, in the end means that there is no free will, as free will would mean: at any dimension and free of restrictions.
but it is quite reconciling that there is free will within the finite-dimensional experience of time: the subjective one.

If a pseudo random number generator is not compatible with your definition of free will I do not understand how a (real) random number generator can make it any better. How does the free come into play if our mind draws its inputs for decisions from a stream of random numbers?

This one tortured me from the age of 15 or so (whenever I saw a Horizon documentary on AI, Searle etc) to midway through university, when I gave up on the dream. This was a huge shakeup for my worldview, and was greatly influenced by hearing Susan Blackmore talk to the philosophy dept here (1992/3 i guess). She had spent years passionately chasing evidence for the paranormal, before regretfully - and bravely - coming to the conclusion that it just wasnt there. Until I heard her speak I was chasing the same trails, and looking for a story about consciousness via quantum wierdness was (for me) a part of that. Yeah Id call them Penrosian ideas btw.
 
Subsequently Ive come to terms with being composed of inanimate matter, and with my thinking, feeling and remembering (avoiding nouns here helps; Dennett got that from Ryle fwiw) being grounded in fairly ordinary chemistry. I used to find that picture of the world somehow horrible and cold; now I find it strangely beautiful. Rather than being made of mere matter, I get to think how amazing it is that the only difference between me and my raw ingredients is the way Im arranged. Its left me with an almost pantheistic outlook

I do not understand the problem. And this solution with quantum mechanics certainly does not solve anything.
 
Lets just assume something: One really smart mind finds out the answer to the question whether there is free will. Now he tells people Hey, the solution is, there is no free will, its all deterministic.
What would happen? Nothing. Nothing would change - the world would run as it was.
So lets assume something else: He finds out that we do have free will. Wow, everyone likes to hear that somehow, but what would actually change? Nothing. Again no one would do anything different just because he knows he has free will.
Ok - so for me the conclusion is: There is no difference. Its both the same - free will or not free will, the problem does not exist.
 
Oh yeah - there is this third option - the guy finds out well, its all quantum stuff. Well first of all - I dont get why anyone would conclude that this reconciles free will. By definition it means everything is random. No will at all and no determination. (and Ive read your other article about it, I think there you pretty much agree at the end).
Now what does that solve? Nothing at all.
 
I think the question you ask is the wrong one. We do have to first find the correct question - then we can try to find the right answer.

I dont think thats quite fair. Imagine someone discovers one day that the Eiffel Tower isnt connected to the ground. In one sense, this wouldnt change much  people would still go up in the Eiffel Tower, it would still look nice in photographs, etc. But it would be very fascinating to learn how it managed to stay in one place without being connected to the ground and also why everyone thought it was connected to the ground for so many years.

Title: How Dumb is Daniel Dennett?
 
It continually amazes me how many otherwise-intelligent people I know claim to be fans of Daniel Dennett, a bitter hack philosopher who spends his days sucking up to scientists and writing personal attacks on other philosophers. As Daniel Davies put it, I used to be a rabid Dennettite [until] I started reading more widely in the subject, and found that Dennett had been pretty (no, make that very) badly behaved [] And thats when the hate developed.
 
At some point it feels unfair to keep picking on the guy, but I came across a gem that, even after looking at it for months, still manages to amaze me. Here, in full, is Daniel Dennetts argument determinism is compatible with free will.
 
(For context, this comes after pages discussing Conways game of life, in which some deterministic animated squiggles dont bounce into (avoid) other animated squiggles.)
 
It logically follows that:
 
(Gazzaniga and Steven, p. 65, summarizing Dennetts Freedom Evolves, p. 56)
 
One just has to marvel at the sheer stupidity it takes to advance such an argument, much less base a 368-page book on it. I mean surely in the course of writing such a book you would come to notice that your core argument is based around a pun. (Shame also on Gazzaniga and Steven, who also base their argument on this absurd piece of logic.)
 
Yes, Daniel Dennett is literally arguing that because in some deterministic animations depict things being avoided, determinism does not imply inevitability. (It would seem an obvious corollary that Mickey Mouse has free will.)
 
Why do people still take this man seriously?
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

I guess to be more precise, I should ask where you think the contradiction is. Explaining that more carefully will help me identify more precisely what it is you dont understand. (Your implication that Mickey Mouse cartoons are a good example suggests to me youre confused about intentionality and perspective, I guess, but I cant say for sure. Partly because the prior sentence doesnt scan.)

I thought it was fairly obvious. The flaw in the argument is line 3, at least assuming we are using inevitable in its traditional sense in such discussions.
 
Basically, the fact the fact that an object in a deterministic world is avoidable in the sense that other deterministic-world objects appear to avoid it, does not mean it is evitable, in the sense that the deterministic object could do otherwise. Running through the argument with Mickey Mouse:
 
While the cartoon wall was, in principle, avoidable, it was inevitable that the deterministic Mickey Mouse would walk into it.

Aaron,
 
Id expect you to know better than to waste time arguing about definitions with philosophers. Exactly how we define vague concepts like free will, evitability, or avoidability, doesnt really matter, since there isnt much to build on those definitions. They just dont seem to fit into a rigorous logical framework, so lets shrug, and focus on things that do.
 
Is there other work of Dennetts that frustrates you? In particular, what do you think of his theories about the Darwinian evolution of memes?
 
Cheers,
Andrey

Free will as most non-philosphers mean, is like Medival free-will. Here, agents are the pan-ultimate cause of their actions and they thus could not be predicted with a machine that knows everything about the present (arguably, then, the future is not entirely knowable).
 
Free will as compatibalist call it, is about the the will (attempt to perform actions) as being unconstrained. This is called Hobbian free-will.
 
-For the keen physicalists (where qualia are are subset of the physical, like gravity/fields and such), free willing agents dont feel constrained or oppressed. They feel how they are programmed to: if someone holds a gun to your head and takes your money, you will felt unfree, whereas if you are having fun with some freinds, even though it was determined physically a long time ago, it feels unconstrained.
-For the unkeen and foolish physicalists out there (who think robots=humans and CPU chip/AI complexity = consciousness), no coherent definition seems to be given.
 
So really, compatibalism is a misleading and confusing word. Determinism is not compatible with medival free-will, but it is compatible with Hobbian free-will.
 
Sowhat we have here are definition wars as usual ;)

Im with some of the other commentators in that Ive never really understood why people feel so strongly about free will. Given that a universe with free will is indistiguishable from one without free will, it seems to me not to matter what we call our particular one.
 
But I did think (despite disliking the whole seventies-retro-feel that the game of life thing brings to the book) that Dennett had a point in the first 50 pages of his book. Humans are open systems, and our dynamics are not determined by knowledge of any small subset of the universe.

Why would Denett bother to argue that determinism doesnt imply that everything is un-dodge-able?  Thats a claim any incompatibilist would give him.  I cant believe he would be stupid enough to then go on and claim that inevitable-as-undodgeable = inevitable-as-had-to-happen-given-the-laws-of-physics-plus-initial-conditions; 
But if he doesnt, then theres really no point to giving this argument in the first place.  Maybe G&S misunderstood whatever he actually said?

the interesting stakes in this case is that gazzaniga uses dennetts argument to show that justice and law are relevant in a world of deterministic neurobiology, because our will is the underpinning of all european law.
 
to the extent that we choose evil without coersion its our societys right and obligation to punish us. we presume our moral decisions occur outside of the context of environmental forces - anything that forces the hand of an individual, even nature, removes personal responsibility and renders the legal system irrelevant. this is why we have coercion defenses and insanity pleas.
 
the avoider language is important- its specifically about avoiding committing crime. its really troubling to see a legal scholar grasping at straws like this. i have a roomba that wanders in a random walk around my house, but avoids falling down stairs due to a sensor. dennett and gazzaniga seem to be saying by extension, because of the existence and observed behavior of my robot, robots that do fall down stair have chosen to fall. therefore if falling were a crime, they could be prosecuted for it. of course, theres no will here, theres just a sensor, which is present or not, and working or not. these men have nothing based in the science and the medicine, merely defective logic based on knowing little about cellular automata, and a kind of willful semantic ignorance of the language they are using.
 
i dont think the argument for the legal system is as weak as gazzaniga makes it, but it points to medical research being highly disruptive to societys ideas of justice in the next few decades. i hope better arguments than dennetts are put to the task.

I dont find this argument to be much dumber than Searles argument that computers cant be conscious because they arent brains (a brain, of course, being that which is conscious) - whatever the reason why you fail to see the stupidity of Searles argument, people probably fail to see the stupidity of Dennetts argument for the same (or a similar) reason.

a) yes, the pun is terrible.
b) Andreys comment about wasting time arguing about definitions with philosophers is somewhat disconcerting. That sort of thinking goes a long way toward convincing me to not buy another philosophy book outside the classics, ever.
c) You all need to go contemplate the consequences of quantum mechanics and thermal physics (especially Brownian motion) on synapses and other cellular ligand-receptor systems. You should also contemplate how neurons, or small systems of neurons, will likely prove to be Turing complete. One example of how cells could be Turing complete (1) control: the universal DNA-RNA-protein dogma, (2) program: the unique cellular machinery of each neuron, (3) data: synaptic and interstitial inputs that stimulate the machinery to do things that lead to other outputs. Also contemplate the lossy nature of this biological computer: entropy, leaky integration, thermal losses, all conspire to insert a fair amount of random data into to Turing machines.
 
Along those lines, explain why psychoactive drugs work. I guarantee a person on clozaril and haldol will have a different set of thoughts one hour after the injections that they would if they hadnt taken the injections.
 
Im pretty sure that once the dust settles, maybe in this century, well find that while the neurons, or small sets of neurons, may be turing complete, theres simply to much quantum randomness in the brain (synaptic and interstitial) to advance any simple deterministic model, yet at the same time, it will be difficult to argue that the mind transcends the physical processes that occur within. If anything, we will probably extend the entity which is the person to include the whole person. You lose your pinky toe, youll have different thoughts. You may still be able to work on high level math or debate the merits of the death penalty, but if you loose part of your pancreas, or a kidney, the chemistry of the interstitial fluid in your brain will be oh so slightly different, or will degrade more quickly over time. Something will change in your thinking.
 
In a very real way, you can manipulate your own future thoughts be manipulating your current environment. If you start buying fewer processed snack foods then youll be less likely to think about weight loss programs in 20 years. Of course, youve been manipulating your own thoughts for years. Or have you? Where did the first manipulations come from? Or were those simply the condensations of many random events that piled up over time, influenced, remember, by environmental stimuli too, environmental stimuli that have been effecting your outcomes all the way since your mothers eggs stopped reproducing while she was in utero, leading to decisions her body made about which oocyte follicles would mature, and your fathers net pH the night you were conceived, leading to a subtle shift in which spermatocytes could gain entry to the maternal oocyte, on which night, and whether or not she drank that night, which might affect, slightly, when your neural tube closed, and some weeks later, how much glucose she had on board when it was time for your heart to start beating  did it start a few minutes later, slowing the rate of division of neurons in your brain for a few moments?
 
While the whole thing may be deterministic, after allowing for quantum mechanics and initial conditions, the machines are so numerous that the system is so complex that the only functional way to get through life is to act on what we perceive to be free will. The Greens fMRI results of the trolley problem hint at this.

Aaron,
 
Its much more honest to do another post professing your love of Searle then to call Dennett dumb.  As has been pointed out, you have probably done very little to read any Dennett without an agenda going in.  Dennett has written books which do have content that is not personal attacks, e.g. many people familar with his recent work Breaking the Spell.
 
There is a temptation to suggest, and I will succomb to it, that you are embarrassed by how much you are an advocate of Searle.  Your post does not mention the name but the dsquared quote that you dug from 2002 did not finish this sentence:
 
Dennett had been pretty (no, make that very) badly behaved when it came to falsely attributing strawman positions to John Searle, and not admitting it when corrected.
 
Now someone has brought up the question of why you are so concerned about the issues of determinism and free will.  I am curious about this also.  In your article about the game you leapt rather quickly to the notion that we are so much more than machine.  What are you so worried about?  Determinism versus free will is an old concern and lots of people have moved on to more reasonable debates.  From my point of view, we know its far too hard to predict relatively simple phenomenon (on our scale length, ignore the fact that quantum mechanics is probablistic) compared with humans.  Why bash Dennett when all you want to say is that you are a real boy?

Aaron,
 
Im not surprised that you disagree with my characterization of Searles argument, but I have not been able to understand it in any other way, even after asking him personally about it when I saw him speak several months ago.
 
I asked him why a computer simulation of a brain couldnt be (or contain) consciousness, and his response, verbatim, was simulations leave something out.  If his position is that any conceivable simulation of a brain must leave something out, it is hard to imagine what the something must be if not gooey gray and white matter.  IOW, computers cant be conscious because they arent made of the same stuff as brains.
 
If Im misunderstanding Searle, do enlighten me.

Aaron,
 
That argument displays the exact circularity Im talking about.  How do the physics of consciousness know that they have to attach to a brain that is conscious, but not a brain that is not conscious?  (Such as one of a person in deep sleep, a coma, recently deceased, or, say, the brain of a mosquito).  Do you have a way for the laws of physics to detect sufficiently complicated neural activity?
 
(This is notwithstanding that there is no reason for anyone to accept the existence of qualia in the first place, though I assume that is a premise of Searles argument.)
 
By the way, I didnt accost Searle, I asked a question during the Q&A session, and it was very much in the context of what hed been talking about.

How do the laws of physics attach conscious to awake people but not to people who are knocked out? Clearly the brain must be doing something specific to cause consciousness when were awake and do it differently or fail to do it when were knocked out. This is biological naturalism. Clearly this cant be the case for simulations, since a computer can be simulated by an appropriate series of ping pong balls and flippers and it seems pretty obvious that those dont do anything special to cause consciousnes.
 
You dont have qualitative experiences? I dont believe you.

Why is it obvious that neurons do something to cause consciousness, but obvious that ping pong balls and flippers dont?  This is why I summarized Searles argument as computers cant be conscious because they arent brains.  (pretty much any time you use clearly in a philosophical argument, you are using it to mask some unfounded assumption).
 
I have qualitative experiences.  I have no evidence that they are the result of a physical substance that has attached to my brain.  That part is pure speculation, like the ether of victorian science.
 
Anyway, the point here is not for us to rehash tired arguments about consciousness.  My point was to illustrate that you are making some assumption that makes Searles arguments sensical, and Dennetts nonsensical.  I dont particularly like either of their viewpoints, but I dont attribute that to their stupidity, I attribute it to their different starting assumptions.

Its like saying A picture cant be made up of tiny little dots, because looking at each little dot, nobody can tell if its part of a picture or a just a random blob.
 
A human body cant be a bunch of atoms, because looking at an atom, nobody can tell if its part of a human body or a rock
 
Hence - A brain cant be a big computer, because looking at each circuit, nobody can tell if its part of a human mind or a video game.
 
I cant see how you can reasonably ignore all the evidence from neurology, in favor of a slippery phrased bit of pontification that should be approached with suspicion on vagueness alone.

Aaron,
 
Youre comparing apples to atoms.  Yes, its obvious people are conscious and ping pong balls arent.  But nobody is suggesting that ping pong balls (or transistors), individually, could become conscious.  The question is about large collections of them.
 
A more valid comparison for you to have made would have been Because neurons are conscious and ping pong balls arent.  Do you disagree?, to which I would have answered yes, I disagree, because I dont think an isolated neuron is (or can be) conscious, any more than I think an isolated transistor can be conscious.
 
And if you think an isolated neuron is conscious, I dont see how you can defend that position by any means other than repeated assertion, since no isolated neuron has ever been observed to displayed any sign of consciousness.

weighing into the consciousness debate
Fodor had a nice response to Searle. Imagine putting a little metal wrapper on each axon, and another one on each dendrite.  This wrapper mediates all neuron-to-neuron connections. A signal travels down a neuron, hits a wrapper, the wrapper passes neurotransmitter-simulator to the other wrapper, which interprets it and sends the corresponding signal on the next neuron.  One would think that, even if all of our neurons were wrapped this way, wed still be conscious.  Its hard to imagine why not; the same stuff is going on in our neurons; only the space between them has some mediating interaction.
 
But once we start mediating our neuronal interactions with a neurotransmitter-simulator, we can imagine replacing just about everything in our brain with simulators made of metal (or ping-pong-ball plastic or whatever you like), and as long as all these things are performing functions that are isomorphic to brain functions in the right way, wed be conscious.  So machines with such brains would also be conscious.
 
And anyway, biological naturalism doesnt necessarily follow from the Chinese Room computers-cant-be-conscious argument.  If Searles right that the Chinese Room is in fact isomorphic enough to what the computer (or any turing machine) is doing to rule out conscious computers, then maybe the brain isnt a turing machine.  Then we need to find out what it is and make a machine like it.

Doesnt the logic fail here itself? The implicit assumption that avoiders avoid harms means they are conscious of harm to avoid it.

Hi I kinda think youve missed the point of Dennetts talk of evitability.  He doesnt claim to be providing what you call Medieval free will with this example but instead to be showing that the lack of medieval free will does not mean that we lack all sorts of free will.  The point of Freedom evolves is to show that evitability or free will can exist within a deterministic world and to argue that it is these forms of free will that are the morally   important ones.

Searle responds to this in a later book. He does not think that wed still be conscious if all our neurons were wrapped this way. Assuming wed still be conscious under these circumstances is tantamount to assuming biological naturalism is false, since biological naturalism suggests theres a biological process other than pure neuronal interaction that leads to consciousness.

This applies especially when the author is someone like Daniel Dennett, and it applies especially when other smart people dont make a fuss about it (or at least no the simple-minded fuss that you make). Youre like a non-physicist who comes across Einsteins theory of relativity and exclaims: How could mass possibly be related to energy like that?

Title: Introducing theinfo.org
 
A lot of the work Ive been doing on Open Library for the past few months has to do with handling large quantities of data. Either Im writing crawlers to download them from various public web sites, or Im meeting with librarians to persuade them to give me copies, or Im evaluating algorithms for processing them, or building tools for viewing it all.
 
And while Ive been doing this for information about books, Ive noticed my friends doing similar things in other fields. Reporters try to get large data sets to write stories. Programmers get large data sets to add features to their sites. Friends are trying to make available data about the inner workings of the government.
 
And while each community has ways of talking to each other  reporters talking to other reporters, RDF people talking to other RDF people, library hackers talking to other library hackers  theres no community that cuts across these topical lines. And thats too bad, because theres a lot there we could share, from tips on how not to get caught when crawling to tools to make it easier to build big charts and maps.
 
So thats why Ive started a new community site for people who work with large data sets. Its called theinfo.org and Id really appreciate it if you joined the mailing lists and spread the word.

Great idea Aaron. Im a consultant working on international trade agreements. The availability of comprehensive data sets on trade flows, trade barriers and production/demographic data has transformed the making and analysis of international trade relations in the two or three decades that Ive been at it.
 
There are some very large data sets accessible via the Web. But in this domain they can be SO large that its difficult to access them via the web (the bandwidth problem is only the start).
 
Ill keep an eye out for developments here (thanks very much for the link to CKAN, by the way. Didnt know about that).

This year I only read 70 books, down from over 120 last year. I guess thats not too bad considering this was the Year of Other People  I still beat my general goal of 52. Once again, here are the books that struck me as completely worth reading. This year, though, Ive intermixed them with the other books I read:
 
The original Nickeled and Dimed, Orwell lives as a plonguer and a tramp in Paris and London respectively. The descriptions of such poor conditions are typically riveting and a great deal of fascinating reflection is included throughout.
 
Hugh Laurie, the British actor (Americans know him as Gregory House, M.D.), takes his first crack at writing in this comic novel. (The novel was originally sent to publishers under a pseudonym to avoid celebrity favoritism, but naturally sales forced him to publish it under his real name.) The plot is a fairly standard spy-guns thriller, although very well executed, but the books brilliance is the way it adeptly undermines its own cliched language, to hilarious effect. In that way its a lot like the British TV comedy People Like Us (itself well worth seeing). A good, fun read.
 
This book combines, in abbreviated form, the arguments in all of Searles work up to the time of its publication (which is basically everything except Rationality in Action). In doing so, it basically has all the hallmarks of Searles work, only more so: a clear exposition of complex philosophical ideas that demonstrates how to think better, useful tools to help you understand your world better, and genuine philosophical solutions that let you resolve confusions you may have had before. And all of it is done with Searles customary wit and style  almost an anti-style, like that of D. J. Bernstein, in which he simply explains things clearly and concisely. A model of public philosophy.
 
A strong, fun novel, packed with interesting ideas and characters and gimmicks, telling the story of people I love to read about: jetsetting academics. Im normally not one for novels, but I have to admit it: Lodge makes it work. My only caveat is that this is part of a trilogy and one should probably read the first book, Changing Places, first, since later books refer back.
 
Short, meaningful, and elegant. More than you could reasonably expect from such a book.
 
Including this is not quite right, because I cannot actually recommend this book without reservation. Alinsky is an anecdotalist, not a writer, and the first half of the book drags as he forces himself to come up with some general platitudes and lecture the youth of today. The second half, however, is incredibly fun and gives you an excitement and energy about accomplishing things with power politics that you just cant get anywhere else.
 
Sadly, there arent any good alternatives I can recommend. Alinskys biography, Let Them Call Me Rebel by Sanford Horwitt, is quite good but has a few serious failings. First, it drags a great deal in the middle between the beginning of Alinskys career, in which he worked for Al Capone as research for his University of Chicago sociology dissertation, and the end, when he organized the black neighborhoods of Chicago and Rochester to fight the white establishment. During these middle years, Alinsky didnt do much except watch three wives get sick and die and the book spends several hundred pages watching it happen. (Also, frustratingly, the book seems to be exhausted by the time it gets to the interesting end part and covers it in less detail than one would like.) Furthermore, the biographer apparently has come to severely disapprove of his subject, especially his habit of exaggerating or inventing stories about himself, that his disapproving tone takes all the fun out of the action.
 
Another possible alternative is Michael Gecans Going Public. Gecan is one of the top people in the Industrial Areas Foundation, the foundation Alinsky started and ran for most his life. Going Public is his attempt to go back to writing (apparently his college career) and tell the stories of the battles he fought as an IAF organizer. Gecan has much more of a flair for writing than Alinsky, but never got the chance to develop his editing skill, and the result is an uneven, sometimes overwritten, book. Also, Gecans IAF is much more watered down than Alinskys ever was and some of his tactics just seem downright silly.
 
Theres also Alinskys first book, Reveille for Radicals, but this can be dismissed as coming out during the early part of career, before some of the most fun stuff. So, because of the extreme importance it had on this year and because I have no serious alternatives, I have to recommend Rules for Radicals, along with everyone else.
 
I read this entire novel in one sitting and it touched me in a profound way. It asks what it means to dedicate your life to writing, by looking at four people who come together, each of which has taken a different position in the New York intellectual scene. Its also recently out at a film, which is a very bizarre experience to watch, because the book takes place almost entirely in the characters heads while the film will have none of that and only shows the brute actions. Im not sure other people will have the same experience I did, but as a writer I found this book very powerful. By the same token, Im looking forward to this years All the Sad Young Literary Men (and gleefully downing the new issue of n+1).

What I suggest wholeheartedly: Robert Nozick: Philosophical Explanations, Chapter 6: Philosophy and the meaning of life. or a softer version: Examined life. If you are looking for a classic: Bertrand Russell on logical atomism or on Berkeley.

Im almost ashamed of how little reading I do after reading this.  Pretty much all of my reading is done on the bus to and from school.  Thanks for the inspiration.  Maybe in a month or two I will make it my goal to read 10 books in 30 days.  (February is the RPM Challenge, and I still havent decided whether I want to participate in that.)

I suspect I read a lot more than the average person, but less than the people Im trying to imitate (social science academics).

I hadnt really thought about it that way, but I guess so.

Its hard to make such broad judgments about a reading list.

Title: 2007 Review of Projects
 
In August I noted that I had taken on an enormous number of projects and did not suspect they would all succeed. (It has since been pointed out to me that one of the secrets of successful people is that they try a lot of projects and then you only see the successes. So perhaps this is not as bad a strategy as I initially thought.) Now that the year has come to a close, I thought I would review the projects I mentioned there and see how they were doing.
 
Open Library: Moderate success. Open Library has a team of six or so people working on it. Its not progressing as quickly as I would like, but it is progressing. The demo site has launched and there are no big hurdles in our path. Personally, Ive learned an enormous amount about managing projects.
 
Memoir: Failed. At the end of last year, I planned to start this year to take a week to write a memoir of life at Reddit. The writing proceeded on schedule but towards the middle of the week I fell terribly ill, realized I would not be happy with the resulting book, and reluctantly abandoned it. Why did it fail? There were lots of mid-level reasons (Im not that interesting a subject, my memory of the period was poor, I was doing it with impure motives) but the fundamental one was that I just did not honestly believe a memoir of my time at Reddit was a book that was worth reading. I only lost a couple days, so this was not a devastating failure.
 
Psychology book: On hold. After the Reddit book, I begun researching and outlining a book about the highlights of psychology. I am still interested in this book and think about it a fair amount, but I put the project on hold after I started work on Open Library.
 
Another book: Unknown. In the other post I said I was working on three books. I cant remember what the third one is now. I think about different books a lot but I dont think Ive pursued any others very seriously.
 
Consult on Berkeley Big Ideas: Failed. I had no big ideas for helping this project and I did not follow through on finding any. I had made no strong commitments, so I do not consider this a serious failure.
 
JobBook: Intermediate. An initial site is launched but I have not spent a lot of time on it nor is it progressing rapidly. Other people are pursuing it, though, so I feel less pressure.
 
Science That Matters: Intermediate. This site has launched and a fair number of posts have been written, but it hasnt been updated in a while and nobody else has really joined seriously. But the site hasnt been officially abandoned, so its not a total failure.
 
Jottit: Moderate success. The site was finished and launched and got incredibly positive reviews but hasnt really caught fire with traffic yet. Perhaps this is because its a great product that no one wants to use or perhaps we simply havent figured out how to market it yet. (If you want to try to market it, contact me@aaronsw.com.)
 
Statful: Intermediate. This was a project I mentored for Summer of Code to allow for better web stats visualization. I was a fairly bad mentor, in retrospect. A fair amount of the coding got done for this project but I did not have a clear design in place ahead of time so the software is not especially usable. If any readers want to help work on the design for a free software web stats analyzer (you know, something that will tell you whos visiting your site) please email me@aaronsw.com. I still think the project is finishable but it certainly has languished for a while.
 
Seddit: Failure. This was the other Summer of Code project. The code got written but not tested or launched and has since languished. The schedule budgeted time for launching the project but apparently not enough. I think the lesson here is that in such projects launching should be done first and features added later, so that whatever results is usable. Also, I should be a better mentor.
 
Gmail clone: Failure. I got a couple of people started working on this project but I didnt follow through because I felt too overloaded. However, people have since pointed me to Posterity and Sup. Again, the consequences werent too bad. I wasted some peoples time, but not an enormous amount.
 
Book reader: Intermediate. I finished 70% of this but never launched it. Just never got around to it. The same was true of a number of other web projects.
 
Journalism: Success. I had two articles published for money and a third is on its way to the editor.
 
Paper: Intermediate. Plagued by difficulties, the paper has been teetering on the brink of failure for another year. I think a big problem was not having a partner who had enough time to push me about it more.
 
Novel: Intermediate. I had to stop working on the novel when I got sick but I mostly did it on time when I was OK and a shocking number of people seemed to actually read it. I will try to finish it early this year.
 
All in all, I think it was a fairly mixed year project-wise. A couple minor failures, a couple minor successes, and a couple big projects where time will tell. In truth, it may be too soon to evaluate this year. If Open Library becomes a big success, this year will have been well worthwhile. Otherwise, its legacy will be more mixed.

Hello Aaron,
 
I really wonder why you ask how to market Jottit. Did the Reddit experience taught you anything in this regard ? The answer would definitely interest me, it does not have to be some memoir !-), but it would be useful I think.

Title: Starting Out in the Morning
 
Thats how you discover a persons true nature, someone in Starting Out in the Evening thinks: by the way she wakes up in the morning.
 
For a long time, I have woken up in the morning with nothing. Recently, because I have been sick. Before that, because I was split up among many jobs. Before that, because I nominally had a real job. I miss the days when I woke up with purpose, when I lived to toil at some grand accomplishment. The feeling that all of life is in the service of some larger goal. Its fantastic.
 
I have been finally getting over my too-long illness, nursing myself back to strength by reading. When I was a kid, I used to take Saturdays to read, really read, devouring five or six books in one sitting. I havent read like that in years, but now Im doing it again  checking out stacks of books from the library and setting upon them one by one. Its fantastic.
 
And I dont just breeze thru the pages, I roll around in bed and pace the floor and sit in the bath fighting my brain around their words, knowing that theres some way it all makes sense, some way it can fit together, if only I can summon the strength to grab it. I wake up with thoughts of books in my heads, questions, anecdotes, stories. Its fantastic.
 
I feel like the books are bringing me back  back not only to health, but to the world of thought and action, the world of accomplishment, the world of doing something grand with oneself. Its fantastic.

Wanting is one reason for subjunctive and delay.
 
In a perfect world, everybody HAS a grander purpose in his or her life, based on rights and responsibilitites.
The world acts as one, composed of endless unique  evolving and passing -  to create the best future.
Beyond incompatible religions and (ego-)complexes (injuries/unsatisfied needs) and injustice anybody can go for his or her personal talents - and does so, because this makes happy.
How sad that anybody thinks a system that produces the need to fight against itself might be the right interpretation of an enlightened humans word.
Its like cancer, if you regard one for all.
Dangerous but curable.
 
A perfect world? Replace perfect: evolving healthily. Happy caring creatives.
 
All the best for the future and healing for the past, by the way!

Aprospos by the way, Aaron: You can discover a persons ACTUAL nature by the way she wakes up in the morning.
I had a big part of my childhood and sometimes have the same experience of reading - when I take the time to celebrate my addiction to reading :-)
In combination with all the other great things to experience and do. (Take care for the balance ;-))
Fantastic, yes!!
But as the morning IS so important - what I expect of my morning is an everyday is birthday feeling. Like in childhood, do some of you remember? You wake up and have to kick your legs and arms and jump out of your bed to spread all the happiness and excitement throughout your body: A bright new day, I can do whatever I want - and I immediately have a plan what exactly to go for today.

Title: The Theory of The Game
 
I have to admit, theres a part of me that gets no small enjoyment out of the fact that the first piece I wrote for a paying publication is nominally a review of a book on pick-up artists that actually ends up spending most of its time on glosses the history of American dating, discussions of foundational experiments in control of the emotions, the history of behaviorism in psychology, and the computer functionalist philosophy of mind. In other words, the typical article for Other.
 
I originally planned to post the review here to my blog, but instead I bumped into Annalee Newitz while I was writing it, she expressed interest in it so I sent her the draft I had and next thing I knew it was getting included in the next issue of the magazine. Reading back over it, Im not sure I have a more to say in its favor other than its definitely the weirdest review of The Game that will likely ever be published.
 
A couple paragraphs got removed in the print version I have and the editors added subheads to break up the flow, but heres the original piece as I sent it to them:
 
The Theory of The Game
 
For a couple of weeks, it seemed like all my friends were reading a thick black book with a leather cover and gold-edged pages. Is that The Bible? I finally asked them. It might as well be, said one. Its a guide to picking up girls, another explained. I scrunched my face. Oh, no no no, the smartest one there said. Think of it as an ethnography of a community of pick-up artists. (More)
 
If you like this kind of thing, consider picking up a copy of Other magazine, available in indie bookstores across San Francisco and thru the web site.
 
(Explanation in advance: I know fans of computer functionalism (what a weblog to have such readers!) are going to attack me for my oversimplification of their views. Well, if you want, Im happy to attack your views at length and the conclusion comes out basically the same. So bring it on.)

Well, I indeed believe your review suffers from some amount of mysticism stemming from your AI views. For example, here Id say youre in part knocking down a strawman here:
 
Instead, the AI proponents cheer loudly every time someone gets a computer to do something we think of as a human task. Aha! they proclaim. Computers can beat humans at chess. How can we deny them humanity now?
 
While there are pundits who would say that silly thing, you know serious researchers into cognition understand the difference between means and ends. To take a simple example, walking is in fact a very complicated task, and its very difficult to make a machine walk like humans do. But nobody claims walking embodies some deep aspect of the human condition which cant ever be done by a machine, and that accomplishing getting from point A to point B by driving is the same thing.
 
Anyway, its very doubtful how much the elaborate theory of the PUAs is in fact true, as opposed to mumbo-jumbo tossed on top of some very simple stuff - If you want to pick up girls in bars, sound halfway interesting and dont be a jerk (as well as some unpleasant stuff about the realities of the bar scene). Youd think, given the environment, someone would try some experiments. But there would be very little marketing incentive to report to that group that its nonsense, a kind of placebo effect.

From what youve written, I cant tell if you are asserting that computers will never be able to replicate the functioning of the human brain or rather that a computer that does so will still be missing some magic ingredient required for human being-ness. Both of these assertions are non-obvious and I personally would like to see at least a precise argument for one of them: what, for example, does the fact that Deep Blue doesnt mimic human thought processes tell us about the prospects for doing so?
 
It also seems to me that you are conflating two different research agendas when you talk about AI. One attempts to build computer systems that are good at things that humans can also do (like play chess or understand natural language) and the other attempts to replicate exactly what human brains do. The former seems to be the focus of most current AI research and the latter to my knowledge is pursued by scientists studying the brain. If you are proposing that there are fundamental limits to what either of these research programs can accomplish, it would be interesting to know what exactly those limits are and why you believe they exist.
 
Anyway, thanks for the interesting article!

The review of the PUA material was pretty much spot-on.  Very few PUAs take a step back from the material and try to understand why its working; they use it, it works, so they just keep doing it.  Really, all it does is take away your fear - fear of the unknown (script the entire conversation!) and fear of rejection (treat it as an experiment!).  Any guy whos unafraid and at least somewhat interesting will have about the same success level as a master PUA.  As far as I can tell, the whole Alpha Male mythology thats layered over the top of those basic truths has little to no scientific basis.
 
Anyone could also overcome those fears by just going to bars over and over, and it wouldnt take a smart guy very long to figure out the scene, but to most guys, thats an absolutely terrifying ordeal.

It seems to me that the author of this article is full of his own assumptions and biases which prevent him from seeing things with more nuanced goggles.
 
The pick-up artist, by following a script of interesting-sounding things to say, by bringing props that the girl can easily comment on, by basically orchestrating the entire conversation in advance, comes into this room of copycats like a breath of fresh air.
 
OK, that a fair enough statement, but then he starts to tear it down as if its especially inauthentic, manipulative and deceitful.
 
Wow, this guy is so different, you think The guy isnt especially interesting; hes just bothered to pick up a script.
 
If the girl thinks the guy is interesting, who is the author to argue that hes not? Maybe the author never gotten a reaction from a girl like that on his own, so he assumes that anyone who IS able to get strong positive feedback from a girl must be cheating. But whats unfair about improving ones game? Nearly any opening line is a canned statement. Asking a girl for a drink, asking if she comes here often, telling her shes really beautiful are all prepared statements designed to elicit a certain response. The problem with the authors analysis, as I see it, is that he assumes captivating openings which makes one stand out from the crowd are deceptive, which I think is total bunk.
 
As you might guess, a system based upon treating women as objects and works by discovering ways to deceive them doesnt really work over the long-term. But when youre picking up new girls every night, it takes a while to notice that.
 
Treating women as objects and discovering ways to deceive them? Whats especially deceptive about asking two girls if they prefer chocolate or flowers? Or if they think women lie more than men? Or if they think its OK for men to wear pink? How do you suggest we open a conversation? Maybe tell them, Ive never been with a girl and I want you to be my first. That might be honest but is it interesting and effective?
 
So the author divides people into two groups: those who treat women like objects and deceive them with prepared stories and those who dont. But not all prepared openings need to be deceptive or especially demeaning to a person. Making lewd statements, belitting someone, using intimidation, sexually harassing someonethose are ways of treating someone like an object, but The Game has nothing to do with techniques like that. So the two camps hes artifically trying to divide people into simply doesnt hold water.
 
As far as whether this material can lead to a long-term relationship, the author seems to assume that no one who uses any prepared stories or dresses in a way that attracts attention could possibly be the least bit interesting. Yet again hes dividing people into two groups: interesting vs not interesting. But why assume that guys with good game must score so much lower on the interesting person meter than anyone else in the bar? These seduction community techniques simply provide strategies and techniques to open groups and begin conversations with people in non-threatening ways so that you a least have a chance of connecting with them on a deeper level. There might certainly be more interesting guys at the bar, but if they are just sitting in the corner entertaining their buddies they dont look very interesting compared to the guy with the funny hat doing coin tricks or analyzing your handwriting.
 
The book is full of stories of nice girls being snatched away from their sweet, devoted boyfriends by the counterfeit charm of a pick-up artist.
 
Counterfeit charm? Nice. Are you sure their devoted boyfriends were devoid of all counterfeit charm when they first met, first dated, and first went to bed together? Devoted vs. not devotednice one!
 
a system based upon treating women as objects 
  You treat them like objects, you find techniques that succeed on them as objects, and then you think of them as objects. And who wants a long-term relationship with an object?
 
This idea of treatment women as objects amounts to a dumbbell theory. Dumbell theories are when you take something and divide it into two extremes, like Good vs. Bad, Conscious vs. Unconscious, Left-brain vs. Right-brain, Intellectual vs. Emotional. They provide just enough parts to tell stories of conflicts, but are rares an accurate portrayal of how things really work.
 
People do all sorts of things to attractive attention to themselves and appeal to the opposite sex. Make-up, hair dye, high heels, fashion, tatoos and jewelry to name a few. Behaviorally we tell jokes, we tell stories to make ourselves look noble or wise, we use manners and etiquette to make people feel at easy and to demonstrate good upbringing. How are opening lines and fashion tips from The Game any more deceptive than any other attempts at appealing to others?
 
The Game isnt about treating women as objects. Its not about degrading them, intimidating them, harassing them, or anything like that. Yes, some of the techniques involve teasing, but its harmless stuff like those shoes look comfortable or your teeth remind me of Bugs Bunny nothing malicious or abusive.
 
I think the writer of this article really failed to understand what The Game is all about. There are plenty of guys in the world who are very decent people. They have hobbies, stories, ideas, hopes and dreams, but when it comes to women, they are simply too shy and too unsure of themselves. They lack the confidence required to to face an attractive woman in a public place, surrounded by people who can hear and see your performence and witness painful and embarrassing rejection.
 
The seduction community attempts to arm these guys with a set of theories, ideas and techniques to help them better navigate the dating scene in a way that presents themselves in the best light. And these guys are learning that even if they arent the tallest or the most handsome guy at the bar, even if they arent wearing the most expensive clothes, they still deserve to date an attractive lady as much as the next guy. And some of these techniques, when properly applied, give them the confidence to approach women without looking like a needy dork, and sooner or later these small successes translate into geniune confidence and real social adeptness.
 
Instead, the AI proponents cheer loudly every time someone gets a computer to do something we think of as a human task. Aha! they proclaim. Computers can beat humans at chess. How can we deny them humanity now? But their computers dont play chess at all like humans do.
 
Sorry, but no one doing serious research in AI believes computers play chess exactly as humans do, and I dont believe the seduction community is full of people who believe people are devoid of subjective experience. Discerning readers will find that straw man arguments like these hurt more than help your arguments.

Aaron, I think youve made an argument against behaviouralism and put it in the shiny clothes of an argument against functionalism.
 
Functionalism allows for internal processes with unbounded complexity, subtlety and variation.  All of your argumentsare based on the simple predictability and manipulability of behaviouralism.

Top Ten Problems with Cowboys Argument (in order of appearance):
 
The problem is, the girl doesnt think the  guy is interesting. The girl thinks the role the guy is playing is interesting.
 
They are, if they arent original. Pick-up lines are ineffective, mostly because they come off as corny. They sound fake. These are just as fake, they just dont appear to be. Thats deceptive.
 
Thats exactly the authors point. To reverse your question, it may be interesting and effective, but it is honest? What do you value more  effectiveness, or honesty? If youre not being honest, youre being deceptive.
 
Sure it does. There is certainly a qualitative difference between openly devaluing women (e.g. harassment and belittlement)  and viewing women as finite state machines (e.g. run this routine -> get a phone number). But the fact is, neither of these views are of women as individual human beings.
 
The author is not making this assumption. What he is assuming is that guys who are faking good game are less interesting than strong, interesting, and naturally attractive personalities.
 
Which is, in general, a good thing; however, what youre leaving out is the fact that it is done with an ulterior motive  the men the author is talking about dont just want to connect on a deeper level with women. They want to get in their pants. It would be great if PUAs put these skills to use to be more sociable people; unfortunately, it is most often the case that sociability is only directed towards getting girls, rather than being interesting and sociable with people of both genders, in all situations.
 
Admittedly, it is a generalization. The fact remains, it is generally true, although there are nuances that are left out.
 
Because unlike with physical modifications a) a fake personality can be drastically different from a real one, and b) the distance between fake and real personalities can be far greater than between, for example, made-up and natural faces.
 
Again, you make the mistake of equating objectification with malice and abuse.
 
This is the biggest problem with the pick up scene. These men need to learn to share those stories, hopes, and dreams with people in constructive, genuine, and interesting ways, rather than using generalized, impersonal material that isnt necessarily relevant to them as individuals. The pick up scene has a lot to offer, especially in terms of inner game. Where it goes astray is in making it rote and impersonal, rather than true interaction on a deeper level.

The problem is, the girl doesnt think the guy is interesting. The girl thinks the role the guy is playing is interesting.
 
Oh dear. We are all but actors and the world is our stage.
 
[The author] assumes captivating openings which makes one stand out from the crowd are deceptive. 
  They are, if they arent original.
 
Consider these openings:
-Can I buy you a drink?
-You have a beautiful smile.
-Do you come here often?
-Hows it going?
 
Are they original? No. Are they deceptive? According to your logic, if they arent original they must be deceptive.
 
Interesting that you feel that way, but I think youre throwing logic and commonsense out the reason to make a petty point.
 
Pick-up lines are ineffective, mostly because they come off as corny. They sound fake. These are just as fake, they just dont appear to be. Thats deceptive.
 
First, The Game doesnt really have pick-up lines. They have Openings. The difference is that once you use a pick-up line, youre on your own. But Game styles openings usually have various branches that you can take, each typically designed to increase your perceived value. But you certainly dont have to stick to someone elses material. You are encourged to create your own. But the Mystery Method and other systems supply theories and guiding principles. Second, the purpose of Openings isnt to instantly woe someone into bed. They are still ways to start conversations with someone in a non-threatening way. They get your door in the door so you can start to build comfort and, if you play your game well, move to the seduction phase. Building comfort is the longest stage of the game, and the most challenging for social robots who just memorize canned stories.
 
Whats especially deceptive about asking two girls if they prefer chocolate or flowers? Or if they think women lie more than men? Or if they think its OK for men to wear pink? How do you suggest we open a conversation? Maybe tell them, Ive never been with a girl and I want you to be my first. That might be honest but is it interesting and effective? 
  Thats exactly the authors point. To reverse your question, it may be interesting and effective, but it is honest? What do you value more  effectiveness, or honesty? If youre not being honest, youre being deceptive.
 
I think youre reading way too much into this. How honest is asking somone: how you doing today? Do you really want to know all the details of their day? Trying to defraud someone out of money is deceptive. Lying to a girl about your committment to her so you can sleep with her is deceptive. Asking her if she thinks its OK for men to wear pink isnt deceptive. Its called making conversation.
 
But not all prepared openings need to be deceptive or especially demeaning to a person. Making lewd statements, belitting someone, using intimidation, sexually harassing someonethose are ways of treating someone like an object, but The Game has nothing to do with techniques like that. So the two camps hes artifically trying to divide people into simply doesnt hold water. 
  Sure it does. There is certainly a qualitative difference between openly devaluing women (e.g. harassment and belittlement) and viewing women as finite state machines (e.g. run this routine -> get a phone number). But the fact is, neither of these views are of women as individual human beings.
 
Think of it as self-marketing. All advertising and marketing is not deceptive. You can make honest, accurate statements about a products features, its effectiveness, and the benefits to the user without being deceptive or dishonest in any way. But are you treating people like objects if you try to anticipate and address their concerns in order to close the sale? Anytime we negotiate with anyone about anything arent we running routines on them? If I tell my boss that I deserve a raise because of x, y and z accomplishments and because Im being paid under market-value etc am I treating him like an finite state machine?
 
So how do you get a girls phone number or score a date with a lady? And what makes your technique so pure and innocent compared to any attempt I might make? I think you arguments amount to little more than a pathetic smear campaign.
 
Why assume that guys with good game must score so much lower on the interesting person meter than anyone else in the bar? 
  The author is not making this assumption. What he is assuming is that guys who are faking good game are less interesting than strong, interesting, and naturally attractive personalities.
 
But guess what, even Naturals can improve their game. Im a natural, and Ive slept with hundreds of ladies well before reading any books like The Game. I just heard about this whole PUA scene from a friend a few months ago, but already Ive make significant improvements to my game. Im dating super model tall Japanese ladies and I only sleep alone when I want to.
 
These seduction community techniques simply provide strategies and techniques to open groups and begin conversations with people in non-threatening ways so that you a least have a chance of connecting with them on a deeper level. 
  Which is, in general, a good thing; however, what youre leaving out is the fact that it is done with an ulterior motive  the men the author is talking about dont just want to connect on a deeper level with women. They want to get in their pants. It would be great if PUAs put these skills to use to be more sociable people; unfortunately, it is most often the case that sociability is only directed towards getting girls, rather than being interesting and sociable with people of both genders, in all situations.
 
OK, I think what you just write is the essence of your true gripe with the game. But you shouldnt assume we all just want to get laid. We might want to find a long-term relationship or just have someone to go for a walk in the park with. Watch the VH1 Pick Up Artist videos online and tell me that you think those guys have sinister motives.
 
But I also think you are holding a common but mistaken view of women. Not all women are pure, honest ideals of commitment and devotion. Some women actually enjoy sex on a non-commitment basisI know plenty of them. Women use men for fancy dinners all the time. And theyd be nice to you one moment, then ditch you as soon as you guy them a round of drinks. And guess what, women cheat too. The researchers in Liverpool found that rates of cases where fathers unknowingly raised another mans child ranged from 1% in some studies to as much as 30%. Women read magazines all the time with tips on appealing to the opposite sex i.e. make-up tips, fashion tips, skin care tips and sex tips. Why give guys such a hard time when we get together and do the same thing? Because assume our motivation are bad and their are good. But I think youre assumptions are unfairly biased.
 
How are opening lines  any more deceptive than any other attempts at appealing to others? 
  Because unlike with physical modifications a) a fake personality can be drastically different from a real one, and b) the distance between fake and real personalities can be far greater than between, for example, made-up and natural faces.
 
haha, fake vs. real personalities. another dumbell theory!
 
the sum total of high heels, eye liner, lipstick, rouge, eye shadow, false eye lashes, fake nails, dyed hair, fake boobs, makes for some pretty drastic changes. Just compare some natural

FYI: The Game isnt about finding that special person youre compatible with, its about finding a warm wet hole to cum in. Its a step up for men that will fuck mud. Admittedly, a large portion of men seem to be in the fuck mud category.
 
I kind of assume anyone in a bar looking for a woman is uninteresting. Theyd have to dig themselves out of that hole first.
 
Wow, he mentioned you in the article. Neat.
 
Oh my god. Ew. Youre in the mud category, arent you?

Another response to Cowboy:
 
Oh dear. We are all but actors and the world is our stage.
 
Maybe so. But one should still attempt to be as true to ones self as possible.
 
Consider these openings: -Can I buy you a drink? -You have a beautiful smile. -Do you come here often? -Hows it going?
Are they original? No. Are they deceptive? According to your logic, if they arent original they must be deceptive.
 
Sorry, I was unclear. If they are original, they arent deceptive. If they are designed/learned with the specific knowledge that they will make one appear interesting, they are deceptive. On the other hand, the universal opener (Hi!) isnt. deceptive. There is no problem with approaching women and being a genuinely interesting person capable of genuinely interesting, genuine interaction.
 
Game styles openings usually have various branches that you can take, each typically designed to increase your perceived value. 
 
Yes, thats my problem with it. Theyre designed. The user isnt really being himself.
 
The Mystery Method and other systems supply theories and guiding principles. 
 
Which is the authors point. The opening is the first step in the algorithm. Even if the opener, routine, line, kino, whatever is different, there is a specific algorithm. Perhaps youve heard of the DiCarlo Escalation Ladder (http://www.directnaturalgame.com/Techniques/kino-escalation-ladder.html). This is a prime example of an algorithm. Mystery even calls pickup an algorithm in his book The Mystery Method as shown in a quote from Chapter one:
 
In relationships, if someone doesnt have success and wants to get it, he or she will need to adopt the algorithm for success there. I invented that algorithm. I am your teacher and this is your guidebook to discerning the patterns in dynamic social interactions and then using them to your advantage.
 
Cowboy makes an interesting point in saying
 
How honest is asking somone: how you doing today? Do you really want to know all the details of their day?
 
and
 
Asking her if she thinks its OK for men to wear pink isnt deceptive. Its called making conversation.
 
There is a fine line. What decides the issue for me is the intent. And honestly, my biggest problem with the whole thing isnt openers  youre focusing on them, but I can live with a canned line to get a guy going as long as the conversation that follows is genuine.
 
Are you treating people like objects if you try to anticipate and address their concerns in order to close the sale? Anytime we negotiate with anyone about anything arent we running routines on them? If I tell my boss that I deserve a raise because of x, y and z accomplishments and because Im being paid under market-value etc am I treating him like an finite state machine?
 
Another interesting point. With the boss: no.  When asking for a raise, and telling him x y z, you are not presenting a front. You are not engaging in fakery. You are making a real argument. Thats fine. Most sales is like that too. The problem isnt the attractiveness, its the intent and whether the attractiveness is genuine or simply learned/imitated.
 
Even Naturals can improve their game. 
 
Thats beside the point. Anyone can appear to be something they arent. A natural can appear to be an even better natural. The problem is the fakery, not the level at which one starts out. If youre a natural, fine! If you arent, okay! Just dont 1) pretend to be something you arent, or 2) view women as objects.
 
You shouldnt assume we all just want to get laid.
 
Point conceded. Not all of those involved are in it solely for sex. In general, though, their learned social skills are put to use in a gender-specific manner; that is, they use them to dominate other men (AMOGing) and gain status with women.
 
Not all women are pure, honest ideals of commitment and devotion. Some women actually enjoy sex on a non-commitment basisI know plenty of them. 
 
I agree. I only sleep with women on a non-commitment basis.
 
Women use men for fancy dinners all the time. And theyd be nice to you one moment, then ditch you as soon as you guy them a round of drinks. And guess what, women cheat too. 
 
All of which is just as wrong as when men do it.
 
Women read magazines all the time with tips on appealing to the opposite sex i.e. make-up tips, fashion tips, skin care tips and sex tips. 
 
Again, there is a difference between adopting, to some extent, a different personality, and putting on makeup.
 
Why give guys such a hard time when we get together and do the same thing? Because assume our motivation are bad and their are good. 
 
No, I agree that womens motivations may be equally as impersonal. There is a difference between dressing up in a certain way, putting on certain scents, etc. (regardless of gender) and saying or doing a sequence of things designed to, with the knowledge that success is likely, make ones personality appear more attractive. Personality is more fundamental to a person than facial structure, breast size, or skin tone.
 
The sum total of high heels, eye liner, lipstick, rouge, eye shadow, false eye lashes, fake nails, dyed hair, fake boobs, makes for some pretty drastic changes. 
 
Again, personality is more fundamental than physical appearance, but I agree that makeup, etc. can go too far.
 
To be clear: I do not have a problem with most of the inner game stuff offered by the pickup community. Becoming more socially confident is admirable and achievable for most men. Confidence, ability to communicate, and having interesting skills, stories, hopes and dreams are all very good things. But men should become interesting people, develop their own skills, have experiences that translate into interesting stories, and have the guts to dream big on their own.
 
Men should become truly better men.

Wow, the lengths to which a PUA will go to justify his art are absolutely astounding.  I cant believe people are still spouting this being a PUA makes you a more interesting person nonsense, especially since Mystery, the godfather of the community, specifically says in his lectures the goal of the Venusian Arts is to walk up to any group and GET THE GIRL TO SLEEP WITH YOU.
 
Arguing morality is pointless.  Instead, Ill just say this: most PUAs pretty much use this stuff to get laid.  I dont really have a problem with this, as most of the art focuses on picking up scenegirls, who are pretty much out there to get laid as well.  However, a great deal of them have the illusion that itll translate into a healthy relationship.  It does for a time, because people who sleep together form very strong emotional attachments.
 
However, relationships formed on a pick-up are shaky - witness Styles latest girlfriend.  He thought he found the one, and he wrote The Game because of it.  Then, a couple years into their relationship, she dumped him because despite his foolproof game, he was still a pretty insecure and boring person.  The mPUA, the master of all master pickup artists, couldnt hold down a girlfriend for more than a couple of years.
 
The only Game worth pursuing is truly eliminating your fear and insecurity, and I cant see any way of doing that other than long sessions in therapy or massive amounts of psychoactive drugs.

Telling a story is running a routine on someone. Youre trying to get a reaction be it sympathy, or a laugh, or trying to paint yourself as the hero. But you live in a pretty sad world if you ban story telling on the grounds that its non-original (prepared statement!) and designed to make you look more interesting than you really are.
 
There is a fine line. What decides the issue for me is the intent.
 
Yup, I pretty much got that out of what you wrote. I think the crux of our difference hinges on what one defines acceptable and unacceptable intent. If a girl had a fun time with a guy she metbe it in a bar, a park, or on the trainand she felt attracted to him enough and comfortable enough to enjoy sex with him, I dont see any harm, even if that is the only thing he really wanted to do. Its a win-win. :) But I feel your views on sex are probably more Victorian than those widely held here in Japan.
 
Again, there is a difference between adopting, to some extent, a different personality, and putting on makeup.
 
One could argue that the use of make-up, heels and hair-dye is MORE deceptive than using canned material to make conversation. Take the started, Who do you think lies more, women or men? Its pretty transparent they the intent is to start a conversation that generally appeals to womens interests. And as far as whether or not the guy is an original personality or a interesting individual: hes reading books on social dynamics and doing experiments in the field, measuring the results and refining his theories. THAT makes him pretty fucking interesting in my book. Much more than the guys at the bar who spend their hours watch sports, tv sitcoms, or playing X-box.
 
My point is that you keep dividing people up into Fake vs. Real, but I dont believe ANYONE is 100% original in everything they say and do or 100% robotic in their used of scripts and prepared material. Its a bell curve and I think everyone lies somewhere in the middle: we recycle old jokes; drop lines we read in books, heard in movies and on television, and learned from our friends. We incorporate various elements of our heros and idols into our personalitysometimes from real people, sometimes from our heros in the world of fiction.
 
How much of what we say is owned more by tradition, social convention and by the language than some inner creative well-spring? Robin Williams, who I think wed agree is a pretty unique and original personality, is constantly recycling old jokes and doing improv characters like Iron Chef that he invented years and sometimes decades ago.
 
If any of our friends were completely original at every moment it would be freaking scary. Instead our friends role-play with us. We reinforce who they are and what they value in our dealings with them, and they sometimes play along and sometimes breakout of their role in order to challenge the model weve formed of them. If they were completely unpredictable were think they were crazy. Creativity is variations on a theme. There are examples of this all over the place in the world of product design, architecture, in the arts, in the world of fashion, and when that construct we call ones self makes public utterances.
 
Originality is the art of concealing your sourcesh

Im glad we were able to discuss this. Ive come to a clearer understanding of the specific problems I have with the pickup scene, and I dont think Ive been as clear in expressing these as I could have been.
 
Telling a story is running a routine on someone
 
It can be interpreted that way. My issue is that rAFCs learn to tell stories that are both a) someone elses and b) part of an algorithm, rather than developing their storytelling abilities and engaging in interesting experiences.
 
You live in a pretty sad world if you ban story telling on the grounds that its non-original.
 
True. The issue is whether it is clear that the individual is telling a story. In pickup, its not just entertainment, or trying to communicate a point. Its appearing as something else.
 
If a girl had a fun time with a guy she metbe it in a bar, a park, or on the trainand she felt attracted to him enough and comfortable enough to enjoy sex with him, I dont see any harm, even if that is the only thing he really wanted to do. Its a win-win.
 
I agree, as long as neither partner holds any illusions about the nature and intent of the other. This starts to get at the root of my objection, which Ill discuss at the end.
 
Take the started, Who do you think lies more, women or men? Its pretty transparent they the intent is to start a conversation that generally appeals to womens interests. 
 
Ok, but as I said previously, the opener is what I am least concerned about. The fact that it is an algorithm is what troubles me. You still havent addressed this concern.
 
My point is that you keep dividing people up into Fake vs. Real, but I dont believe ANYONE is 100% original in everything they say and do or 100% robotic in their used of scripts and prepared material. 
 
This is, of course, true. But the majority of PUAs are not being themselves. Style made pickup a lifestyle, devoting all his energies towards that, and he says himself that he became a totally different person.
 
It seems Ive been making several arguments.
 
Originality is not my biggest concern, although it would be nice if men could go out and become more interesting people by doing interesting things, learning interesting skills, and becoming more confident, rather than using canned stuff. The inner game part of pickup is great. Its the fakery that most men use for outer game that isnt. There are exceptions, of course.
 
The problem of the algorithm is twofold. First is that it seems unfair. This isnt an argument worth pursuing. Competition is a natural part of life (and especially mating) and fairness has nothing to do with it.
 
The second problem with algorithm (again, Mystery himself described it this way) is that in guaranteeing a specific result, it encourages men to objectify women. When you press a button on your keyboard, you know what character will appear on the screen. Once interaction with women becomes nothing more than pushing certain buttons, it is nearly impossible to perceive women as individuals.
 
Cowboy pointed out that its a win-win situation if a girl just wants to have a fun time and get laid. This is true, but in most pickup situations, the goals of each partner differ significantly. The PUA just wants to get laid (again, a generalization) and the target may or may not want more. The problem is, the individuals dont actually get to know each other. This comes back to the idea of originality.
 
I think the biggest beef I may have with pickup has nothing to do with women. Pickup encourages men in the idea that getting sex is the definitive measure of success, and the ideal to strive for. Style wrote in The Game that to be really good at pickup, it had to become a lifestyle. The fact is, women can be more than their bodies, and men can be more than their sex drive. Many pickup routines are attractive because they make it appear as though the man understand the woman; that he sees past her attractive body. But this cant be true when the point of pickup is getting laid.
 
Pickup is destructive to women, in that it encourages their objectification. But it is equally destructive of men. The message of pickup is misguided. Even if pickup didnt actively encourage the absurd gender roles we see today; that is, even if it were simply a system to allow men to get sex more often and with more attractive women, it still enables the view of women as objects and men as horn-dogs.
 
The idea of sex as all-important and the measure of a persons quality or success is backwards and harmful. Men should focus on self-improvement and self-investment.
 
Its been good writing these responses, as Ive uncovered nuances in my own beliefs. Thanks for taking the time to discuss the issue.
 
Hope your 2008 is a good one, and happy hunting ;)

Its funny to reflect on the pickup scripts as simple input-outputs in terms of language reflecting personality triggering a response. In reality, there is a lot more being expressed than simple routines, the intonation, the rise and fall, rhythm of words, excitement, anger, tension. All those things can be evoked with mere grunts and squawks. Words and ideas just add a layer of psychological icing to the cake.
 
There seems to be an assumption made by these wannabe game players that women can be manipulated using the same basic symbolic exchanges, but the reality is that masters of the pickup art would usually have to be lithe and deft gesticulators, using sensory flirting, touch, and smell just as much as language, and using the language to merge the psychological attraction with the sensual.
 
An ugly guy who is a great dancer is far more attractive than a good looking guy who is clumsy and dull. Its obvious to most women that a guy with good rhythm is going to give them a much better fuck. So I think it is a myth that looks dont matter, personality does. Looks are a part of someones personality, they cant be separated. Its just that our societal dogma of what is good looking is actually an imaginary thing, in contrast to the pheremone driven reality of flirting, conversation, power games, and rhythms.
 
I think it makes a huge difference whether you consider human beings to be bags of meat with cocks and pussies, or complex glowing singularities of energy.
 
To look at it from another perspective, it seems to me that it is usually the more artistic and creative people who place a special importance on their personality reflecting a deeper sense of who they really are and projecting that toward others. But if someone doesnt define themselves by that particular emotional need, its not really fair to judge them as being especially fake or deceptive, theyre simply being who they are and doing what they want to do.
 
If an American comic genius satirized the culture/cult of The Game in the same way as Evelyn Waugh did to the Bright Young Things of 1920s British society in Vile Bodies, that would be a book I would love to read. Or maybe the satire is actually The Game itself?

guys who are faking good game are less interesting than strong, interesting, and naturally attractive personalities.
 
The Game is two years old, and the main effect of it being released was to spur the PUA community into becoming all about people transforming into genuinely strong, interesting, and naturally attractive personalities.
 
Mystery Method always advocated using canned routines as training wheels to experiment with initially, and then using experiences from your own life and polishing your story telling skills to tell those experiences in an interesting way.
 
In the original article, Aaron mentions the way that Owen Tyler Durden Cook, founder of the RSD companm was portrayed as the antagonist of book to be a nearly sociopathic bad guy; the book was a fictionalisation of real events though, and after its release, Owen refactored his company to be all about being genuinely interesting and attractive.

Thanks, Aaron, for such a breath of fresh air. Too many of my highly intelligent friends took off their skeptic-hats when presented with Dumbos feather for picking up girls.
 
But isnt there something nice to be said about giving guys the confidence to at least have the opportunity to meet girls?

The pick-up methods WORK, feelings are only temporary. Procedures and methods are the only thing that lasts in the long run. If improving ones game is manipulative then so are commercials, makeup, and high heels. It is packaging, but packaging is the attractor, the opportunity door opener, without it the world would be a very unrealistic and boring place. Anyhow its never going to disappear from this world so you might as well accept it, its for your own good.

====================================================
Date: December 17, 2007
 
Title: No Superpowers
 
Ive been somewhat-obsessively following the recent writers strike in Hollywood. Its got a lot of attraction for me. First, its a big, bold, public labor battle  the kind you dont see much anymore. And second, its filled with people I know. (Yes, Im the dork who actually tries remember the names of the authors of the TV shows I watch.)
 
For those who havent been following, the story is something like this: Amazingly, Hollywood doesnt consist of actors on soundstages simply saying the brilliant lines that come to them in the moment. Instead, people called writers slave away in darkness to craft plots and dialogue which are then turned into scripts for the rest of the people in Hollywood to follow.
 
Despite their importance, writers havent been given much due in Hollywood. They work as employees for studios who pay them money in exchange for the copyrights to their scripts. Meanwhile, the studios then turn the scripts into TV shows and movies that go on to run for years, in reruns and syndication and on home video and DVDs and now on the Internet thru streaming and download.
 
Writers have banded together to form a union, called the Writers Guild of America, to make sure that, just like authors of songs or books, they get paid when the things they write become a success. These payments are called residuals and writers get them when their show reruns or is sold on DVD. The studios have a contract with the guild, and thus with all writers, specifying the minimum amounts they have to pay whenever something like that happens. The guild then audits the studios on behalf of the writers, makes sure they pay their fair share, and then determines which writers deserve the money and mails it out.
 
Studios are still upset about having to pay writers for their work, wishing they could keep all the profits for themselves. Writers are still upset about not having negotiated a better rate for home video residuals. Right now, when you buy a TV show on DVD, the writers get 0.3% of the price  something like six cents, usually. The studios want to pay them the same pitiful amount for online downloads and pay them nothing at all for online streaming. The writers, not surprisingly, would like to get paid a more fair amount.
 
So when the contract between the studios and the guild expired weeks ago, the two sides couldnt agree on a replacement. The studios basically refused to seriously negotiate and that refusal has been going on (in various forms) ever since. So the writers went on strike: theyre no longer allowed to write a single word for a studio until the contract issues get resolved.
 
Instead, writers have been out picketing studio gates, making clever videos online, and trying to bring the studios to the table. As a result, much of television has gone off the air, because there are no new scripts to film. The Daily Show and other nightly comedy shows disappeared immediately, writer-run shows like The Office soon after that, and most of the rest are disappearing as we speak. The studios are continuing to refuse to negotiate.
 
Along the way Ive learned a great deal about the arcanaties of labor law (many of which, like Taft-Hartley, are everyday words in Hollywood), the oddities of Hollywood jargon (the Alphabet=ABC, hyphenates=writer-producers, etc.), and read many gripping stories about what its like to be fighting for your livelihood. (Note to future selves: Dont get in a written debate with people who write for a living.)
 
But perhaps the most touching thing I heard came from J.J. Abrams, the creator of Alias and Lost, and his partner Damon Lindelof. Both are writers and both are bound by the pencils down rule of the strike, even though theyre in the middle of filming the new Star Trek film, presently Paramounts biggest movie. John August describes the scene:
 
Neither J.J. nor Damon are writers on the movie. But they are writers, and WGA members. During a WGA strike, youre not allowed to write on movies or television shows, period. So they cant change a word of the script, nor can anyone else. The script they had at 11:59 p.m. November 5th [when the strike started] is the script they have to shoot.
 
To a screenwriter, that might seem kind of awesome. For once, the director cant change things. But when its your own movie, its maddening. J.J. was describing a scene he was shooting the day before. Midway through it, he got a great idea for a new line. Which he couldnt write. Couldnt shoot. Couldnt be in his movie.
 
Damon described it like having one of your superpowers taken away.
 
I am not the director of a big Hollywood movie, nor am I striking for my livelihood, or even doing much of anything, but I have to admit, thats how Ive been feeling lately. Now that Im getting over being very sick, I find that I dont feel terribly bad anymore, I just feel kind of tired. All the time.
 
So I go to finish up a new piece of software Ive been working on (Ive got dozens, just sitting here, waiting for the finishing touches), and I just cant. I cant type. I feel like someone whos used to having lightning bolts fly out of their hands but now all I get are little sparks. Ssszzt. Szzzt. Bzzt. Ive got nothing.
 
And so Im stuck here in my room, lots of stuff I want to do, but nothing comes out. Its like having your superpowers taken away. Damon, I really know what you mean.

Hi Aaron!
 
I feel sorry for you and would like to help you.
 
The worst problem with being stuck is, that one tends to ask why-questions not to answer and cant go on with how for several reasons, like: nothing comes out. One knows how would be better, but one has the feeling to have the right to ask for the unanswerable why and feel solutionless,empty.
 
This situation is dangerous..storytelling might help.
Just to tell you, storytelling, like you did with bubble-city, started at the wrong time in personal situations, can even increase the situation. You might get the feeling, that even your imagination feels empty.
 
I still think, that a fascinating project, quickly realizeable and with the right team highly sucessful but related to deeper aspects, would be the right thing for you.
Dont get me wrong, I apply my projections on purpose.
 
I shared your experiences, in different times, I was a super-brain once, I had my burn-outs, I could overcome them, sometimes with very freaky methods, but I was aware of them, that was, why I recommended you an adventure.
 
Whatever you might think of me, it is porobably wrong - I like playing but tell the truth though, so that you met Lilo was probably not the easiest way to tell you about my projectbut it clarified the childs view I kept.
I believe in narratic approaches and I am sure this will soon be widely accepted, it is a logical consequence for several reasons not to be enrolled herewell, I play this a little freaky, I want it like this. (Basta ;-))
I still think you and your team should program my tool, detest running after you, but will have to say yes or no soon to a proposal by some entrepreneurs with several million dollar seed-capital, who will buy the center of a realizeable elaborated idea, only the center, while the rest id even more valuable, but I would stand alone with this then, somehow, this depends on the contract I can reach.
But I will get very little,compared to the value, quite a lot, maybe though,  while this project could be programmed by your team within little time - and be foundation for all kind of related augmented (my use of the term augmented is different from the augmented reality term!) improvement tools and solutions. 
The separatly realizeable part of the idea is, from the meta-view, an aid-project-creation-mashine, an addition that will converge fluently, started here in Austria together with an university I will name in my email. I changed the partnership, the recent is a lot more important internationally.
 
Can I trust you and expect an answer, if I send you as much of my serious project, as I have available in English,mostly explanations of the background - starting with a story though?
My project is truly related to Open Library, Real-utopias, developed years before I knew your interstes and projects or even know about you and includes a lot more of things which complement one another. But still the center, the tool is simple, really great and somewhat endlessly to elaborate, always producing valuable contents. And to be published separated from all freaky aspects!!!!
Infogami is so close to my concept too, I just have an all-in-one-solution, of which these approaches are a logical part.
I started with several partners, but left the cooperations because they misunderstood the simplest basics, this is not my fault, it is Austria, the recent proposal is by an American start-up, it lacks a lot of possible outcomes again, but I am close to give up, earn a little and go for the rest separated.
I am not out formoney, I could have realized everything long ago if so, this possible outcome makes me sad and depressive too, but I have donated enough of my life-time for my idealism, and I would not give up over all, just the best strategy.
I get money for the programming here, independently from the mentioned offer, I had to work hard for this - so I could even pay you for it, I am conviced you and your team would be the better ones to do it, better, than my Austrian contacts, better, than the Americans.
I can pay for the programming, but would prefer to partner, as the related concepts could be enroled easily and most important: together then, you are out for the same, unless your public image is wrong.
 
It is the best solution for a life-inventory, self-improvement tool and a lot more, to be created individually game-based by the users.
 
I know it seems crazy to contact you this way, but what should I do? If I know you are the right ones, I try to go for it, I have other solutions, but this would be the best.
I am convinced you will be interested and feel sorry, that I approached you with the freaky part, instead of the serious, I thought you would take it in a good way.
What I play with Lilo is similar to your augmented approach, like blocking your blogbut I have no technical knowledge - and a differnt story, focussed on the same topics, meant to start at a later point, this blog is just half-private preparation, the university accepted it.
This offline-girl approach did not prevent me from creating a demo-version for a technical tool that will turn facebook into one nice feature within an easily individually organizeable personal knowledge organisation structure.
 
Please delete this post when you read it, it is, like some of the others, not meant for public, but I do not really care what others think, so I just posted them, this one is too private.
 
I am ten years older than you are, so you have really not to be afraid I would have any personal interests in you, besides sharing minds and creativity and find a team that can understand what I am out for and work in a think-tank one day, with the right ones, maybe you too.
 
Take Care

Hi Aaron,
 
very nice metaphor, I feel very much the same (including the bunch of unfinished projects, and often feeling sick). I recently asked for help on news.yc, some answers were interesting, I think: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=89861
At least in my case, there is definitely a mixture of several of the things people mentioned: too many projects, not knowing which one I am in love with, unresolved issues in social life and surroundings, reluctance to adopt other peoples coding styles.
As I mention there, the only thing that worked for me recently was to learn a new programming language doing project euler problems. Useless, but at least I could prove to myself that I have not become completely stupid yet. 
Anyway, I enjoy your writings. Since not many other people were commenting, I decided to do it, even though I dont really have a helpful advice.

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 11
 
Jason was a man on the run: Google, with their paws in every phone and PC from here to China, was looking for him. Visiting his friends was out of the question; Google surely had all of them under surveillance. And calling or emailing them was dangerous too. You never knew when they had a Google-powered phone or forwarded their email to a Gmail account (which lots of people did now just for spam filtering). But what if he didnt share anything private? He could at least send a message through Tor telling his friends what had happened.
 
The library was closing soon, so he hurriedly composed an email for Sarah:
 
Dear Sarah,
 
I know what Im going to say will make you think Ive gone even farther off the deep-end than I already have, but its my best shot. I found a backdoor in a popular algorithm and now Google is out to get me. I have to hide out for the moment, but so far Im OK. Please make sure my friends and folks at the office dont get too worried about me.
 
I cant check my email without giving myself away, so if you want to write back, purchase a classified ad in the New York Times  use the word Sarton.
 
Missing you,
 
Jason
 
There, that ought to be at least a start. This way at least Sarah would know what was up and hed have a safe channel for hearing back from Sarah. Never any harm in having another channel for information, right?
 
Jason bought himself a pillow and spent the night sleeping with some homeless people in a little cranny near the library that they claimed each night. They had turned the unused nook into their own little community, gabbing and singing and dancing until late, before curling up in a dark place in a sleeping bag that looked like it had been left out for several decades and turning in for the night. One by one, each of them disappeared to curl up and Jason joined them. By the time the sun and streetsweepers and cars awoke him the next morning, they were all gone, as if their little homeless community had never happened in the first place.
 
Jason looked out over the world just waking up  cars driving to work before the rush hour traffic hit, a couple people scurrying by, shops getting ready to open their doors  and felt like the world was full of possibility. He stretched out and began walking into its gloriously bright morning before he realized it wasnt.
 
Trent knew that staying on top of the business world meant staying on top of what was happening. So he grabbed an intern and headed to The Butler and the Chef, a South Park restaurant for one of his espionage breakfasts. Corporate executives from all over town came here to have lunch and do deals and Trent made sure he stayed on top of what they were doing by taking regular chances to come here and eavesdrop on their conversations.
 
Of course, he knew that others were eavesdropping on his own, which is why he brought along the intern: disinformation. So, uh, what secret projects are you working on, Trent? said the intern in a stage voice. Im glad you asked, Trent replied. Things at Newsflip have never been more exciting. In fact, dont tell anyone this, but were in the middle of acquisition talks.
 
Really? the intern said, looking a bit worried. I hadnt heard that  with who? With whom, Trent corrected. With whom? Well, Im not at liberty to say. But lets just say it rhymes with boo-gull. Wow, said the intern, genuinely worried now. For how much? Oh come on, Trent said laughing, you know I cant disclose that. Oh, but just a hint? Well, if you insist Its somewhere between $200 million and $201 million. A-ha-ha-ha. The intern, knowing his options wouldnt vest unless he managed to keep his job for another six months, looked down at his soup.
 
Wayne was having trouble sleeping. He showed up at his office looking even more disheveled than usual. Even his assistant, who had taken to spending the days chatting with friends on the phone and watching YouTube videos, noticed something was up. Something wrong, sir? she asked. Wayne mumbled and shuffled into his office.
 
It was this damn issue of the kid. Wayne knew, rationally, that it was all for the best, but in his heart it just felt wrong to him. He felt like he ought to use his influence to do something. But what could he do? Why, hed talk about it on his show, of course  Google money be damned. He set up the video camera and began thinking about what he was going to say.
 
I know Ive been a supporter of Google in the past, hed started. But I think theyve finally crossed the line.
 
He looked at himself in the video preview. His shirt was askew and his hair in wild clumps standing up from his head. Everything looked badly wrinkled.
 
Ive recently received information that they are chasing and persecuting a young kid just beca
 
He looked into his own eyes on the monitor. And then he shut off the camera. Nobody would believe him. He didnt have any evidence. And he certainly didnt look credible. And then what? Google would go after him  not only take away the nice office and the pretty assistant, but drag his name through the mud. And God knows what theyd do to his search results. Wayne shuddered to think of it.
 
No, he needed to work this from the inside. Get more information at the very least. He put in a call to Samuel.
 
Sarah read over the email. Then she paused and read it again. And then she freaked out.
 
Hey, Samuel, Wayne said. Wayne, good to hear from you, whats up? Oh, I was just calling to talk about asking if I could come see some Google people I wanted to talk to. Umm, Samuel said. What do you mean? Well, you know that story you were telling me the other night, you know the story about the kid? I dont know what youre talking about, Wayne. Come on, the other night, at the bar, when you were telling me about the kid you wanted to take o Wayne, dont be silly  I was just kidding around about that stuff. Samuel laughed. Heh, you took me seriously? Come on. You really think a company like this would do stuff like that. Give me a break! Anyway, if you want the real story you should just come by the offices sometime. Oh. Uh, okay. How about today? Oh, well, umm, I guess that works. What time? Lets say around 3? Sure, come on by. Great, see you then. Great, bye. Bye.
 
Jason was upset. He was letting his emotional mind get the best of him  hanging out with homeless people on the street and at the library, writing letters to Sarah. He needed to think rationally. He needed coffee.
 
He spent some of his little remaining cash on a large cup of coffee and stole a newspaper from behind a register so he could diagram his situation on it.
 
Heres how it is: Google was using NNA to control the news. Hed found out about this. Google had found out about him. Google didnt want people to know, so they were trying to stop him. He was trying to stop Google.
 
The solution was obvious: he just needed to use the backdoor to tell everyone about what hed discovered and how Google had been chasing him. Proving it would be hard but the fact that he could control the news to force his story to the top would probably be proof enough. Google would try to shut things down, of course, but that would only draw more attention. Theres nothing Internet geeks hate more than having stuff shut down.
 
So he just needed to use Tor to launch another exploit on the backdoor. Itd probably require a few tries to get right and hed have to be very careful about covering his tracks and moving around, but it seemed doable.
 
He was just about to fold up the newspaper when he spotted the classifieds. He figured he might as well check for a note from Sarah. He scrolled thru them, looking for the word Sarton. Then he found it:
 
Dear Sarton, use your powers and say goodbye to the girl. Love, G.
 
Shit, he thought.
 
Back at the office, Trent ran down his list of priorities. Being the boss meant there was just too much to do and far too little time to do it, so Trent had developed a system. Actually, he hadnt really developed a system, hed bought one that had come highly recommended. And he didnt practice it so much as give it to his assistant and order her to do it.
 
Shed come back and insisted that she couldnt actually do it all by herself, that there were things like RAM dumps and reviews that only he could really practice. Oh, alright, he said, Ill do the reviews. How do I do that? And shed explained that once a week he needed to blah blah blah, anyway, he just knew it was important to go over his priorities and see how well he was doing at all of them.
 
Spreadsheets  hed gotten those all off. Boost morale  his meetings had almost certainly done that. Welcome new guy  oh yeah, where was the new guy. He recalled him sitting over hmm, his seat was empty. He headed over, deciding to take a hands-on approach. Hey, anyone seen the new guy? Nah, hes been working odd hours the past few days. Hmm, well I guess I did say he could work from home. Hey, whats that your working on? Oh, uh, nothing. No, come on, bring that window back, I want to see it. Umm, uh, yeah, here it is. Wow, this looks great  I just have a few comments. This whole sidebar needs to be purple and instead of a list of news stories this should show the blog posts with the number of comments. And each one should have a little picture  pictures are key; they draw attention. Um, right  yeah, I guess so. Glad were on the same page  Ill see you later.
 
Trent headed back to his desk and called over his assistant. Sandy, he said. Tell Jane to meet me in my meditation chamber. Yes, sir, she said, and Trent watched as she rushed back towards her desk. He grabbed the bag under his desk and headed to the meditation chamber. God, he loved running a company.
 
Wayne got in his car and headed down the long Bay Area highways toward Mountain View. He passed offices and billboards, trees and curving streets, HOV lanes and overpasses. But eventually he ended up in what could have been its own small city, a maze of office buildings and little poorly-signed streets. At the center of it all was the famed Building 42 complex, with its volleyball courts and dinosaur skeletons and huge cafeterias, and sexy colorful architecture. But radiating out from that were increasingly drab gray buildings separated by large streets and parking lots where they kept all the real employees, the people who stayed up into 3 in the morning to make sure that the Java code that drew the sidebars of help pages worked properly.
 
As Google had built more and more projects, they needed an increasing number of these grunt-work programmers. They had started interviewing just about everyone CS graduate, in the hopes of filtering out the good ones and luring them here to their artificial wonderland in Mountain View.
 
Wayne headed for the lobby.

Back by popular acclaim! At long last: the return of Bubble City.
 
I had figured that Id just give up on this since I didnt finish it before the deadline, but since I got sick and since a lot of people seem to actually be reading and enjoying it, I decided I would continue. Im still not feeling very well, so dont expect daily updates, but I will at least try to finish it in the next couple months.
 
Expect less plot and more description and didacticism, since thats the only way to get the word count up.

Title: Judgment Day
 
People dont like being told that theyre bad. And they especially dont like it if its going to cost them a lot to be good. Finding other ways out is preferable, even if it requires some violence to the truth. Today we look at some ways people try to evade responsibility.
 
[Please read the previous post before continuing.]
 
A large number of people insist that things arent proven or aid doesnt work. In his 1996 book Living High and Letting Die Peter Unger reports a study where he found that, including in administrative expenses and other overhead, $200 could feed a malnourished child through the highest-risk childhood years. UNICEF just recently released a new report finding that, for the first time, the number of children dying before 5 has fallen, thanks to their intervention. And Oxfam, to take just one example, through its development projects in Cambodia has helped over 35,000 people come to support themselves. Doctors Without Borders reports that they treated 10 million people last year, treating 26,000 people from cholera, for example, and treating 63,000 children for malnutrition. Even the most vocal critics of aid, like William Easterly, who has written many books and op-eds attacking government aid programs as unhelpful, has to concede that private projects like Oxfam and UNICEF are successful and positive. Nobody, of course, provides any real argument against these things. They just say its too unclear.
 
If thats the real issue, then donate to an organization like Poverty Action Lab at MIT. PAL does controlled randomized trials of the success of aid interventions. Your money wont go directly to help people, but it will help to test other peoples aid interventions and improve their effectiveness. A recent report [PDF] finds that mass deworming programs dropped infections by 23 points and increased school participation by 25% (thanks, in part, to spillover effects), apparently caused children to grow taller and healthier, and cost only $5 for each disability-adjusted year of life saved.
 
Barry Kelly insists that he has no duty to help others and thus is not culpable for their suffering. Of course, this is an irrelevance. Nobody is trying to put him on trial  just arguing he should do more to help.
 
But Barry goes one step further: he says that he should not help because giving his money to starving people would lead to lack of incentive to compete, lack of investment base for risky & experimental ventures, and congealing layers of bureaucracy feeding on income redistribution. Taking this at face value for a moment, it is not clear to me why why saving people from starvation would cause the first two  wouldnt there be a huge incentive to compete for saving lives and trying new experimental techniques in doing so? Perhaps Barry means that the first-world might have less competition in a field like, say, luxury watches. I dont see this as a tragedy. It amazes me that someone would admit that they prefer to have millions of people starve to death than to have a complicated bureaucracy.
 
In response, Barry explains that there needs to be a cost-benefit analysis. He does not explain what he wants to analyze. Should we make a little chart with the benefits of competition in the luxury watch market on one side and the benefits of saving people from starvation on the other?
 
He also argues that we should do nothing about starvation because many people die in car accidents. I am not sure how this is relevant, but I deplore the deaths of people in car accidents and personally do not drive because of it.
 
Sohail provides the amazing argument that one shouldnt donate to UNICEF because They have a business model that revolves around needy people. To keep the model going, you need needy people. It is not clear how this principle is supposed to work. Are the people at UNICEF supposed to be quietly sabotaging their efforts in order to preserve their jobs? Since non-profit employees generally take large salary cuts and do unusually-onerous work, this seems wildly unlikely. If they wanted a safe job they would surely join the for-profit sector. Sohail provides no evidence for this amazing claim.
 
MC argues that people will starve since he no longer purchases their products. But certainly fewer people will starve if he spends his money directly on keeping people from starving as opposed to having people not starve incidentally because he is purchasing TVs from them. Is he claiming that the people not starving right now somehow have a special right not to starve? Its hard to see why that would be the case.
 
That Hypothetical says that Development economics is a complex subject. Im not sure how this is relevant. Perhaps in the ancient society the King has a lot of scholars working for him making the issue of how to decide which person to choose into some complex subject. That doesnt change the moral issues.
 
Mike Bruce says that if we all spent our disposable income on helping starving people, we might face economic collapse. This seems absurd but also certainly isnt a question anyone is facing. Even if all the readers of this blog spent all their disposable income on preventing starvation, that would be inconsequential in economic terms.
 
There are actual arguments against the issues raised in the last post. These are not them.

There are actual arguments against the issues raised in the last post. These are not them.
 
I notice that you didnt answer mine.
 
This whole argument of yours is the aid equivalent of the ticking time bomb in manhattan argument for torture: you imagine a simplified situation and draw moral conclusions from it which are simply not valid in the real world. I think you can do better.
 
A better way to think about aid (as so many things) is to think at the margin: what variables change which way if you supply a little more food? Very likely population changes upwards. This is bad. Certainly incentives for the locals who grow food, or warehouse it to profit from lean times, change downwards. This is not a silly thing to worry about.
 
Things which promote lower fertility, like literacy, and supplies of condoms, and factory jobs for women, seem much less fraught with possible negative consequences. But youre completely unable to analyse them if you simply count up deaths on your fingers.
 
Funding the Poverty Action Lab is a good suggestion, too. If youre a US or EU citizen, perhaps the best thing you can do is anything towards reducing the agricultural subsidies. Buying food from these places instead of shipping it to them would be a good idea.

Ha! Its interesting how you continue to argue emotionally. Such argument is still absolutist, because it has no end, there will never be enough. In much the same way that politicians ratchet up surveillance and control centralization measures (as opposed to security measures) and justify it with fear-oriented platitudes like keep out the bad people and think of the children, you attack my general statements on the broad problem of aid and poverty in Africa, and the rejection of the idea that we should donate all our non-essential income to other people in particular, with the emotive image of starving people. You used the words starving, starve, starvation no less than 13 times in your post above.
 
I believe it to be pretty well known that reason is the wrong tool to argue against emotion, just like emotion is the wrong tool against reason. I also believe that money invested in the lives of other people needs to be spent with care - implying reason. You point out some excellent uses of money at the start of your article - aid I certainly dont object to, and aid that doesnt involve all non-essential income - and its clear that reason and cost&benefit is being applied, in those cases. We have to do so, since we dont have infinite money. And besides, if we gave all our non-essential income, we would have nothing spare with which to form the fabric of Western society, including its economic surpluses and medical advancements. When you mock my suggestion that cost/benefit analysis needs to be applied, to invoke that faculty of reason, I think you reject reason as a guide to your action.
 
And I think thats the worst thing about your line of argument.

I dont think Im rejecting reason  Im addressing these (somewhat) reasoned arguments in a reasoned way. Starving isnt an emotional word, its the best descriptor I have for the class under discussion. Sometimes you have to use emotionally-laden stories to make moral arguments and the last piece definitely was making moral arguments, but this is to aid reason. Emotion is not the opposite of reason but can often be an aid to thinking rationally.

A better response to objections about one type of helping is to suggest another way to help. I think Engaging in a debate like this was a mistake. I hope the way youve framed objections to direct aid isnt keeping you from exploring real issues and also real solutions to those issues, as its already hindered discussion of those issues.
 
You say the complexity of development economics doesnt change the moral issues, but thats only true if your moral issues are a simplistic good vs. bad. Obviously direct aid is better than nothing, but we have more than those two choices available, and in many cases direct aid is clearly not the best solution. Our alternatives to direct aid include projects like the Grameen Bank. How does that compare to direct aid? Rather than arguing about help vs. not help, we should be dimiss not help as unworthy of discussion and look at the pros and cons of various ways of helping.

I like that their is a debate about aid to Africa. Wether its good or not should be talked about. What I find lacking in this debate is not great arguments for or against, but the African voice. Either they dont talk about AID, or we dont listen. I think any disscussion about aid has to include the people we are trying to aid.
 
On another note, I believe that our aid for food, and medicine is useful for now in a crisis state, but if want a sustainable system of help then we need to concentrate our help into education, and ideas, otherwise no one will be able to be an African doctor or and African farmer.

I agree with Scott that suggesting better ways of helping is a good idea. (Although in one comment you cant see the whole person, of course.)
 
But I diagree that Obviously direct aid is better than nothing, this is not obvious to me. Contact with the modern world has brought a lot of poverty to societies which were not so very poor when isolated from us. Malawi is an example where this seems to have happened (as far as I can tell) mostly through positive actions, like medicine and food aid, not negative ones (like AK-47s).
 
There are lots of good ideas out there. For disaster relief, this scheme in Malawi which sets up ATMs to distribute dollars not grain sounds wonderful to me. The little guy with one truck will buy another to ship food from the coast. And hell still be doing business after the white 4x4s have gone home.
 
For general development, well its all the things I said above: lets buy things from them. TV sets if they make those. Fresh fruit if they dont. Coffee. Go and travel and spend money in local establishments. Sponsor literacy projects. These things seem certain to be net positives.
 
And also, you can almost certainly earn money faster than you can beg it from your friends. So spend your own money, and spend your effort worrying about where its going. Bill Gates deserves infinitely more respect than Bob Geldof.

IF you go to Africa, you can find lots of clothes for sale- clothes that were sent as aid to the country.  However, if you want a suit, you have to import one at great expense.  There used to be a thriving industry of tailors in africa and good suits could be had at reasonable cost but the influx of donated clothes drove them out of business.
 
Charity does not work economically, and from the statemetns you made int his post it is clear that you do not understand economics.  Almost all fo the social responsibility efforts in the world are run by people who do not understand economics and they end up subisdizing and creating more of what they are trying to prevent.
 
Sending a town food and sending them teachers of agriculture are totally different things - the former creates starvation and the latter ends starvation. Literally, somalis were driven off of productive lands and herded into camps and starved so that Said Barre could get more money.
 
Sending aid money and giving microloans have opposite effects- the former creates poverty and the latter ends it. One african nation went from a land that couldnt feed its population to one that exported corn to all of its neighbors simply by ignoring the world monetary funds insistence that it not use fertilizer in its agriculture.
 
The only solution to help people- the only one that works, and the only one that is sustainable is free market capitalism.
 
If you want to help africance, fund microloans or  otherwise work to overthrow the governments that are the source of the problem.
 
Dont call on our government to prop up dictators abroad who starve people as most of the help africa plans do.

Aaron: I enjoyed reading your posts because they reminded me of a more innocent time (aka the 90s), when I was young and still believed in all that goodness. Then I went and studied Economics.
 
Just a few Q&As that maybe, maybe will help clarify Barrys point(s) - some of which I agree with. I am not going to cover every aspect of this (e.g. the psychological effects of aid or how aid facilitates dictatorship), but stick to what I believe are the basics, the core arguments, and they just happen to be related to Economics.
 
I dont really know, nor do I think anybody does because this question is related to a whole lot of complex issues.
 
However, starvation seems to be correlated with low per capita income, low levels of education, lack of adequate health care and non-democratic government (debatable, I know).
 
All these are structural, macro factors.
 
The recipient: Experiences a loosening of her budget constraint (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_constraint), an increase in income. At the same time, her level of productivity (labour output) remains the same. (This is called a ceteris paribus condition, it is a tool for analysis and has nothing to do with the fact that higher income can lead to improved health or more time available for productive undertakings.) One could also say that now the person receives more money for the same amount of output or productivity, or: their wage has risen. I know this argument sounds a bit dodgy when one is talking about the absolute poor, however, the principle can still be applied. A higher wage implies that in order to entice the person to sell even more of their productivity on the market, the  wage rate paid for that additional productivity needs to be higher again. Therefore, aid may increase the so-called reservation wage. In conclusion, the recipient of free income (=aid) may be less likely to seek out other sources of income than they would be without that aid, therefore decreasing the potential for economic activity. This is not to say that aid makes people lazy, especially when were talking rock bottom poor. But think about it.
 
The sender: Experiences a tightening of the budget constraint, resulting in lower purchasing power. I think it is prudent to take a little detour at this point and look at how wealth is created in a modern economy. The simple fact is: Production of the bare necessities is too efficient at this point to keep all of us employed and happy. Thats why developed economies move towards services and high tech. So Imagine there are two people in your economy. One produces food, the other, say, computers. Both of them make more than they need to purchase their food requirement and have plenty left over to buy computers. Now imagine (and I know you can tell where this is going) both of them stop buying computers and instead send all that extra to starving people. There would be no demand for computers, computer guy would be out of work, food guy would have to feed him (taxes!), and neither of them would have anything left to send to their starving fellow humans. The standard of living in industrializes, developed nations has increased because we are able to produce and consume more than the absolute basics.
 
There is more: Assume humans are fundamentally greedy. Maybe to different degrees, but lets face it, one of the best motivators is a prospective gain for ourselves. If we expected to give all our money away, maybe, just maybe, we wouldnt work those 70 hour weeks. Think about it.
 
> Giving aid to individuals does not tackle the problem at its root (i.e. the macro environment).
 
> The type of aid suggested in the previous article would have detrimental effects on productivity in both the recipients and senders economy.
 
And this is where cost-benefit analysis comes in. One may think that a human life is invaluable. However, to come back to the traffic example, we know that streetlights prevent deaths and still would refuse to invest 100% of GDP in streetlights. Wouldnt really be all that practical anyway. There is a vast literature out there on the valuation of human life; this is applied in health care (e.g. NHS is willing to pay up to 30k for one more of full quality life) and transport decisions.
 
So: the benefit of aid would be the aggregated value of all the lives saved. The cost would be the cost to the sender plus the effects of economic distortion caused by ill-adjusted incentives. And these consequences need not be abstract. Weakening a developing economy is exactly the opposite of that you want to be doing, as the poverty = low GDP was what caused people to starve in the first place!!!
 
One has to consider the costs and benefits of an intervention before making a decision, otherwise we are guilty of exactly the same immorality that we were trying to fight. All we can hope to achieve with irrational interventions is to prevent someone from dying by making somebody else die instead. (Hows that for emotional?)
 
And I agree with that thing about the fish.

I too was surprised by how much Malthusian spirit your original post evoked. I have a different critique.
 
A recent, credible scientific study suggests that generosity may be partly genetic  depending on the amount of activity of a gene linked to social behavior in humans and at least one social animal (the vole). The free abstract is at http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1601-183X.2007.00341.x   (Note: the full text costs $3  so much for the generosity of the publisher, who did not fund the research but can collect the toll regardless.)
 
Social factors clearly influence generosity as well  and generosity affects the quality of life of all of us, so it does matter. But people have different dispositions, and will usually end up doing what they want to do anyway. The result is the world we have today. The issue is what to do about it.
 
The original essay by Louis Pascal was commendable in its major intent, but it did remind me of a newspaper story a year or two ago, about a mathematical genius who made a fortune in real estate (apparently due to his mathematical skill plus getting in at the right time, vs. the usual method of personal relationships plus the right time). He so much wanted to help the poor that his effectiveness suffered because he didnt have decent business clothes, since it would be wrong to buy them when poor people needed the money more. He had millions of dollars, but was using it less effectively due to an issue with spending a few hundred.
 
Giving to Oxfam is great. But most people are not going to give $30,000 of their $50,000 annual salary as Pascal suggests, based on a syllogism about a king, ten prisoners, and a gallows. So lets look at two other ways to maybe save the 500 million people who are set to starve to death in the next 50 years.
 
The war in Iraq has been estimated to cost the U.S. $2 trillion, when the full costs of disability for U.S. citizens have been paid. Its clear to almost everyone that the whole war was an unnecessary fraud, that it has left this country far worse off, and that no good end is in sight  yet Congress is likely to vote another $40 billion, because that much money going to well-connected insiders at enormous profit margins is too much for our system to resist. A few hundred more top people devoting their lives to preventing unnecessary wars, or funding others who do, might have made the whole thing go away before it started  and could do the same now with Iran. Two trillion dollars would provide $4,000 of resources each toward preventing the deaths of all the 500 million scheduled to starve.
 
Long ago when I was in 7th grade I looked around and realized that if all the unpopular or outcast kids disappeared tomorrow, they would quickly be replaced  by other classmates not currently unpopular. And if the new ones disappeared, they would be replaced in turn. The social dynamics of the classroom as a whole included some outcast slots, and strong pressures that they be filled.
 
So the question is, how does it happen that many human societies routinely create outcasts who have nothing much wrong with them (including most of the 500 million who without intervention will starve)? If we could see whats going on here, we might come up with strategies to prevent or at least reduce it.
 
For example, on a personal level, how could we live so that we dont contribute to ostracizing people who have done nothing to deserve that  in our immediate circles, and worldwide? And politically, what policies or other measures could we support toward this end?
 
We might start by exploring how modern poverty is created, and maintained by specific government and business decisions. It does not just happen. Nor does it mean that certain groups are lazy.

Perhaps the most powerful argument against saving poor people from starvation (one Im willing to entertain but probably not accept) is that they are then more likely to reproduce. If it is the case that their immediate environment is unable to support them, this may not be a very happy outcome.
 
It is horrible, of course, to even suggest that genocide by neglect is a solution to over population, but it is the only argument that stands - either you play god by saving people (but committing their offspring to a life of misery) or you do the same by simply killing them by denying them help. No luxury watches involved, and logically, its quite difficult to reject any one side.

Lets try a re-framing. Sorry if I ramble a bit; I dont have time to be more cogent today.
 
Poverty is normal. Although outright starvation is not normal, sustenance farming and occasional famines are. As is giving your produce and daughters to the local lord. Affluence is recent and strange. A diamond-shaped society, with most people in the middle, is recent and strange.
 
How can we spread it?
 
One thing that seems to have worked well is manufacturing and trade under the effective rule of law. See also East Asia.
 
Maybe the best plan is to (1) support projects like the OLPC and Project Witness and (2) keep buying crap you dont need. Your profligate waste is the wealth and development for people in Malaysia.
 
(Im as wasteful as the next guy, but its sometimes appalling just how tacky and pointless a lot of the things Americans buy are. You have to wonder what theyre thinking about us when they assemble those talking Santa statues.)
 
Aside: What if you had to choose between your own life, and all remaining elephants, say? I literally dont think I could live with myself after letting an entire order perish from the earth.
 
Anyway, it does seem that people normally have as many offspring as they have the means to, always pushing themselves to the very limit. For some reason, people in developed nations dont seem to do this. I dont think it comes down entirely to contraceptives, because some groups (unfortunately I dont remember which) regularly practice infanticide to keep their populations at the right level; so this is an open option even if contraceptives are not available.
 
So I do buy the argument that supplying people with food who are on the brink of starvation isnt going to help, because it will stimulate population increase. Although this conclusion does feel rather cruel, even as I come to it.
 
(Although one might say that we can just keep giving more aid, when the starving people we saved start to have starving children. Maybe we can.)
 
But lets figure out how to bootstrap more and more of the world into economic development. Helping people get rid of feudal-type rule, and fixing the existing bugs in our way of globalization, seem like good steps to take.
 
How does this sound for a goal? A relatively small number of people living off a relatively small portion of the Earth, performing creative and service jobs while automation takes over almost all of the basics. The only conscionable way to achieve this, starting with the low population, is by ramping up technology and development (or whatever it is) until most of the world starts having small families like we do now.
 
So maybe you should donate your funds to the NSF.
 
No?

Okay, let me try
 
The question (unless I misunderstand) is: Why arent I helping starving people in the third world?
 
1) Morality is a cultural/evolutionary construct that has no objective definition. If I define morality as an agreement between equals not to harm one another (which I think is the actual, unspoken, definition of morality), then Im under no obligation to act on the behalf of starving third-world persons (and certainly that is exactly how most people behave, even if they dont describe their actions in those terms).
 
2) In the real world, no one acts in a completely logically consistent manner. Pointing out flaws in reasoning is only useful when backed up by an emotional plea  and still both the plea and argument can be dismissed (for any or no reasons). You cannot demand that people think or behave in a certain way (well, you as a private citizen, the state can go a little farther).
 
3) In many of these countries (or at least the surrounding regions) not everyone has a distended belly and flies in their eyes. There are often a wealthy few followed by a vast gap and then the poor. Shouldnt the responsibility of helping the poor fall more on the shoulders of their neighbors/brothers? If there is any kind of moral imperative, it certainly should include them  but is there any evidence, for example, that Africas rich are trying to stop hunger in their region?
 
4) Although you say there is no evidence, there are arguments over unintended consequences of food aid. The arguments could be enough (even if the arguments against arent sound) to deter someone from assisting on their own, especially since they cannot judge how effective a program is on their own.
 
After reviewing my own arguments, Im now going to avoid helping starving people in the third world  in the hopes of annoying you, personally. So now it is your fault. :-)

No, this is inaccurate.  People have as many children as makes economic sense for themselves, which for peasant farmers means as many as they can, because at large percentage of those children die at a young age, because children make great laborers, good even at a fairly young age for tasks like watching sheep and babies, and because families are structured such that adult children take care of elderly parents.
 
When industrialization hits, babies stop dying (that is, the infant mortality rate drops from 50+ percent to something much lower), and particularly when large numbers begin moving to cities, to work in factories, etc., birth rates adjust dramatically within 2 generations.  This pattern, quite visible among my ancestors (my grandmother had over 100 first cousins, I have something like 20-25, and my children and grandchildren will have far fewer), and in many parts of the developing world today.

You describe a tragic society which is far too uncritical.  Which indeed suggests that appeals exactly like Aarons must be made more frequently and more visibly.  If these someones are so easily swayed by unsound arguments against change, why could they not equally be convinced by good arguments for.

on the population theory: i used to believe as many of you do about populations in poor countries. you had to let them go, or not provide resources to stimulate possible pop growth. it seems intuitive, but weve abandoned plenty of people, and it hasnt worked. my now ex husband arguing with me when we met made the point that the only way to lower birth rates is to raise quality of living and extend life spans. i was stumped, annoyed. i went and looked at a lot of data current and historical. every damn thing bore him out. i had to review my philosophy about the nature of humanitarianism. indeed, the best way to boost fertility is to let people die at a high rate.
 
on the other hand, im so with free marketers on subsidies. and id like to see imported crops subjected to tariffs when theres a native equivalent- not so popular, but more powerful countries cant help but getting predatorial. thats just the nature of competition. that could go to subsidies within developing nations on things like fertilizer and seed. whats good for the goose is not whats good for the gander.
 
Barry Kelly: there is enough. the frustrating thing is that since the green revolution there has been enough food. theres just about enough drugs, and certainly the resources to make them. theres enough knowledge, plenty of education. theres natural resources, if anything, too much.  So why hasnt it gotten out there? its illogical to assume that it could be the fault of the non-recipients.
 
Joe: Ive been. The clothes thing was really sad and shocking. but aid doesnt create poverty- thats obviously temporally impossible. at most you could claim it perpetuates it. but it doesnt. like everything else in africa, its complex. sometimes aid helps, sometimes it hurts. sometimes it pulls regions through a bad time so they can get on their feet again. some aid supports dictators. some aid destabilizes them. back to my favorite example- zim. aid to one group is likely to undercut mugabe, aid to the other might very well keep him in power longer. free market is not an incantation that makes everything better. and free market isnt the cause of all ills; sometime it works, and we should give it its head. sometimes it doesnt, and we should step in.
 
its obvious that things get better around the time women get power and education. but i dont know which way that causal arrow points, or if theres a factor that causes them both. its not the sort of thing you can try out in a lab.
 
education is an endpoint for a lot of these situations. people need roads and cell phones. they need relatives that travel and strong remittance lines. developing countries are perfectly capable of building schools and putting people in them, provided the logistics are there. i mean, fuck, they are trying so hard right now. they have invented education routes most westerners would never have imagined. we dont need to go tell them Education Is Good and march them into education camps. corruption and political instability are the opposite of infrastructure. and all of these problems arise when infrastructure collapses. im not saying collapsing infrastructure is an exclusive cause, but it certainly occasions all of the above and more.
 
but aarons post were certainly oversimplified and flawed in practicality, morals aside. the analogy was reductionist past the point ofincoherence, etc etc etc blah blah blah. except im not sure i saw him endorsing more than the thought experiment and a couple charities he believes in. the thought experiment worked beautifully. putting the moral scale in your mind forces you into arguing the morals, but mostly more than. you start discussing actions, arguing plans, bashing ideologies together with the thought of suffering people you dont know eight thousand miles away. at the very least, you have to consciously reject them. thought experiments you react violently to are likely to be good ones. by the time youre saying this is impractical! we must do it this other way! bobs idea was stupid, and hes stupid for thinking it! im going off to get the data to back me up! Louis Pascal has already won.

Interesting what brainpower is invested to find  arguments against helping.
 
Its easy, if you have Internet access, are sophist, or realist.
Its wasted, if you ask me.
 
Stop arguing - start helping, yes, on a personal level!
Or simply admit you do not want to.
 
How did this start?
Monetary help. I show you you wont, come on, feel a little knocked, that was, where Aaron started, you remember?
 
Carefully worded to enroll what we can read here, I suggest, at least I thought it was predictable.
 
Maybe Aaron wants to collect all arguments against helping, he never wanted anything else, he wants to watch you?
 
I do something similar since years:
Tell people, that I want to save the world.
Its true.
Whats so terrible about wanting it?
Something must be.
My favourite response?: Its ridiculous. I like short cuts, otherwise these guys start talking about their car or something equally interesting some minutes later.
 
No, its my decision to live, I would choke otherwise. I see my mission in making this world a better place. Not more, not less. Funny is, I see your mission is the same. Some are out for small improvements, some for bigger. Love your family - better place, love your mistress - better place - off your family - worse, love your job - better place, if you are hospital nurse, difficult to say in general, if you are farmer, worse, if you are arms dealer.
If you are well-educated, and you make an effort of showing this, seemingly forgetting that nothing is as easy as collecting wise data today, HELLO, this is the Internet!!! If you are well-educated, you probably think you are intelligent - test it, you would suffer from lying at yourself then, otherwise you are educated, but not intelligent.
 
Its easy!
 
All humans are equal
 
If you say you admit this, you have to want to save the world. Basta.
 
And if you do so, tell the world - it is a really good way to get to know your adverse. 
You save tons of time.
 
You do not trust organisations?
 
Go down the street and help somewhere close to you, if you are afraid an organisation will spend your money wrong.
There are people near you who need help too.
Forget Africa, I and some others will take care.
You are one of those who are perfect to help close to you then probably, a very special mission, congratulations! There are enough who would prefer to spend money.
 
Or create an aid-project and control the business model.
 
Donate for a webcam in Addisabeba, that shows where and how and even through whom some others money helps. Write a self-help-book and earn money you can help others with, about how happy watching Addisabeba-channel can make western civilisation - you suddenly realize how well-off you are.
Maybe this can convine some others, to install their own channel, or this could be your chance!.
If your prospering Where-does-half-of-my-donated-money-get- food-for-the-poor-channel needs employees, relax ! Again only half of it will vaporize, if you are lucky, you can donate the rest directly when you visit your firm.
Worth to consider, that it is more important that half of the money ends as help, than that there is no help, because half of the money could get lost, until another you has an idea how to improve the aid-system.
-sarcastic.
 
New media will improve a lot as to this. We are under control - and we can get our help under control. We can help directly soon.
By the way, this is what I prepare.
Read it and forget it.
-direct.
 
Maybe we can convince cinemas to show trailers with starving kids, telling that half of your popcorns cost will be spent for Unicef, and reopen the doors.
 
But oh, I forgot, all arguments for feeding the starving are reversed, beacause this supports non democratic governments.
A really good argument, at the first sight.
That something is complicated does not mean, that there is no solution.
 
I hope you get me when I switch from being direct to being sarcastic, UPDATE: I added it sometimes.
 
Adopt children from these countries.
-direct.
 
What is the strongest human wish for life ?
 
Could it happen, that money does not make happy?
 
Did you know that people in Nigeria are the most happy on earth?

We are the creators, so we decide.
We can waste our time on investigating what may be genetic and what aquired - or we think how we want to be.

Have there ever been so many and so long comments?
WHO gets emotional here? I do, I was angry, I got a terrible headache - so I started to write. I feel better now.
WHY do you write such a long list? to the one who feels no moral, David.
 
If starving people get food, they will get condoms too, to anotherone up there.
Besides the fact, that I directly want to tell you shame on you for being afraid, that they are more likely to reproduce.
 
Contempt is a cultural/evolutonary construct too, one of the damaging. I should feel sorry for you.
 
But this is, why I do it my way, there is no way to argue with links or posts or numbers.
This is the result.

Aaron, I followed your writing for many years, because Ive always found it to be refreshingly clear and logical.  So this statement, and the direction you seem to be going with this piece, is very disappointing.
 
Emotion can never, never be an aid to reason or logical thought, for the very clear reason that, by definition, an emotional statement is designed to push your opinions in a particular direction  irrespective of the evidence.
 
For integrity of thought, emotion must always follow after reason  one should think dispassionately about a subject and weight the evidence.  Once you come to a conclusion, then you can feel good about yourself  because you know youre doing whats correct.
 
Be wary of arguments laden with emotional terms and hot-button phrases  they are designed to get you to switch off your brain.

Ben insists that Emotion can never, never be an aid to reason or logical thought, for the very clear reason that, by definition, an emotional statement is designed to push your opinions in a particular direction  irrespective of the evidence.
 
Surely this cannot be true. By this logic, arguments can never aid reason because they are designed to push your opinions in a particular direction  irrespective of the evidence. Surely thats absurd. Reasoning involves balancing a number of forces going in a number of different directions and I see no reason why some of those forces cant be emotional. This is especially true in moral reasoning. (Antnio Damsios book Descartes Error provides a neuroscience argument for the necessity of emotion in reasoning.)
 
I am, of course, opposed to hot-button emotional arguments that lead you to stop thinking. Im interested in how emotion can be used as an aid to reason  a way to get people to think more, not a way of bypassing thought.
 
Take for example, the classic Wason four card task:
 
Here are four cards. Each card as a letter on one side and a number on the other. You can only see one side: right now the cards show A B 2 1.
 
Which cards do you turn over to verify that cards with vowels on one side have an even number on the other?
 
People have a really hard time answering this question. (They pick A and 2, because those seem to be the ones described by the rule.) But they find this question quite easy:
 
Here are four people at a bar. One is drinking beer, one diet coke, one is obviously over 21 and one is obviously under it.
 
Which people do you need to check out to make sure no one under 21 is drinking alcohol?
 
(They pick the beer-drinker and the under-21 kid, since those are the people you need to be suspicious of.) Logically, theyre the same question. Practically, people find the second a lot easier to solve.
 
I think there are a number of emotional things that can aid thought in this way.

Aaron,
 
I believe the current hypothesis for explaining the Wason test is that the two versions hook into different parts, or modules, of the brain  one for social reasoning, one for abstract reasoning.  I dont see emotion helping out here  its more about pattern recognition activating the right brain circuits.
 
And of course the social reasoning circuits of the brain can sometimes give a logically incorrect answer, too.  Which is why we should strive to hone abstract reasoning.
 
Emotion is essential for deciding what kinds of things you care about, for sure.  But it is worse than useless when it comes to determining the correct course of action in any given situation, or the truth value of any given assertion.
 
Thats not a good or fair analogy.  Arguments that rely on evidence and logical reasoning from stated assumptions are not irrespective of the evidence  precisely the opposite.
 
If one cares about saving people from starvation, then one should care about effective means of doing so.  A set of emotional images of grateful children receiving aid handouts, while heart-warming, is massively insufficient evidence for deciding one way or the other.

q and Lilo, thank you for your words.
 
Its not a question of solving all the problems right now.  Dont worry, your 50$ check to UNICEF (or whomever) isnt going to do that.  Its probably not about reaching for the solution at all, I think our lives are too short for that.
 
But, if I can help one person, Ive made the world a better place.  No amount of consumerism will ever do this.  The money you paid for your TV or t-shirt arent going to help anyone in the third world.  They received their pittance back when they made it.  Buying more stuff doesnt increase their take, it just prolongs the inevitable end of that company, that plant and puts more money in the shareholders or owners bank account.
 
If, by helping my neighbor, I cause them to produce more children then those children are my neighbors now, too.  I will help them if I am able.  This giving is not based on an economic decision past the acknowledgment that I have excess (which itself is probably an economic decision).  My work produces monetary profit for myself and my family, I want to use that to give someone else comfort.
 
either you play god by saving people (but committing their offspring to a life of misery) or you do the same by simply killing them by denying them help
 
I think this is not the question we should really be trying to deal with.  Like I said before, our 50$ (or 500000$) donations arent going to be the end of anything.  Similarly, my inaction will not be the end of it in the other direction.  I believe that the means are the ends.  Charity does not seek to bring about the end of poverty, it seeks to bring comfort to those stuck with it.
 
We cannot even hope for the end of the suffering Aaron is talking about unless we consider the ending of this suffering something worth doing.  That ending is the process were trying to engage in.  In the words of Martin Luther, sin boldly.  If youre going to screw up, at least make sure youre headed in the right direction when you do.  If youre going to screw up charity, do it by giving too much (time, money, food, clothes), not too little.
 
The call out to emotion is attached to reason not for justification as much as it is for attention.  It is very reasonable for us to ignore this issue altogetherthe issues are too complex, someone else will do it, nothing will help, etc.  But, in an appeal to emotion, the reader is forced to stop and think about it.  This isnt science, were not in a lab, there is no way to separate my mind from my emotions.  So I exercise restraint and go forward with the expectation that I am not controlled by either and both may contribute to my decision to act.
 
sorry if this is a bit scattered, this is something my wife and I have been wrestling with for awhile so Ive had thoughts stored up.

The original hypotehtical doesnt hold water for me. First, how can we compare victims who have no control of their destiny with victims who have significant if not complete control of their destiny?
 
Further, where does it end? If I dont crusade against cigarette smoking am I also in violation?
 
Im also disappointed that Barry got so much criticism. His commentary has been valid and illuminating.

depends on how many twerps you reach, and how many people :-)
 
When I say you and I within the following, I do not adress a certain you, just the opposite position to my view, I am all but a saint, but I follow my view.
 
If i where you, I would have answered: Yes, I am a murderer, luckily I will not be judged for it.
Some believe they will, but have chosen the big fogg too.
 
As I am I, I answer: Yes, I am a murderer, so I try to do my best to stop this, because I feel that this is wrong
 
(I feel(!) AND what I go for due to this reason for deciding, is logical, but my goal is  to do the best I can, I could fail with my plan then, but reach my goal )
 
The question where does this end shows the basic
misunderstandings, which the attempt to reach pure rationality regularly produces. Interesting to watch the  meta-structure of Self-Excuses.
 
Basically, whatever could end at the goal, not theoretical discussions besides and beyound.
 
Whatever tendece your rational argumentation focusses on, it is rooted in and interweaved with feelings. If you would follow back (without collecting arguments, just follow back the single thread (=honest): WHY do you try to argue (besides the point) ?)  you would find a story of decisions to find excuses, based on emotions)
 
The answer is exactly what Aaron said: you do not want to be told you are bad. Plus: You think to be bad is bad and you do not want to be bad. more: you would want to be able to say you are good.
It would be interesting, why you think to be bad is bad ;-)
(The one who would be really really evil would be so, because he has NO reason, all others have a story they believe in, what they do could though be valued evil in its outcome. direct - or indirect - but I do not judge (!) I just watch, sometimes emotional,but the next day more relaxed - and then I focus on solutions)
 
BECAUSE you try to argue rational, what can not really be argued about, you (have to) miss the point - on purpose, hopefully unconscious (see suffer from lying to yourself)
 
Human Rationality, ( should admit the use of both parts of the brain finally, it is even quite  appropriate, as they interact in one head) would not try to walk along all possible threads, except it feels offended - for example by the truth it does not want to face.
 
visualize, there is a cake at the end of the room.
someone asked you to bring her the cake in this room. why run into every room of the tower of arguments, to see if there might be reasons not to ask fort he cake?
except because you do not want to bring her the cake.
If you return to her, you will have to lie - or tell the truth.
Or you try to find arguments, why she should not ask for the cake.
That is what you are doing.
 
I quote Aaron, who pretends to quote W.B. Ellis in order to quote L. Pascal.: At any rate, primarily what I want to find out tonight is how important it is to you for you to act according to your own definition of right and wrong. In other words Im not interested in knowing what sort of behavior you think is right or wrong but merely how committed you are to living up to whatever standards of right and wrong you possess.

I noticed you mentioned Peter Singer, but didnt talk much about him.  Maybe you should have mentioned his simple example of encountering a child drowning in a shallow pool.  You have the option of saving the life of the child, and all you have to sacrifice is some of your time and getting your shoes and pants wet.
 
I was able to get the point immediately since I had taken a course in ethics (where we discussed Singer).  I dont think many of the people who have responded have ever taken a course in ethics.  There are a lot of thorny issues in this world, and no easy right answers.
 
If some people seem to have a difficult time with accepting what was proposed, maybe they should read a little bit of Singer (or other ethics).  Look under utilitarianism.
 
A lot of people seem to be confusing ethics with economics.  One does not have to sacrifice either.  People keep making the absurd claim that you are somehow violating the principles of economics, its inviolate truths, and would be committing a sin, sacrificing ones principles, being a hypocrite, if you didnt follow that simple first rule of economics.  Hey, economics is not a holy faith.  We cant seem to get the free market right (we arent even close, even in the land of the AEI).
 
Arguing this is very tiring.  No one is forcing you to do anything (maybe, thinking).  People dont seem to be arguing against the notion of giving to charity, but against the notion of it being compulsory to give, and to give very generously.  Hey, I do give to charity, but Ill decide how much and if, alright.  But, just to be clear, I do give to charity (see, I am a saint).  But, why shouldnt you be a despicable person if youre living a kings life, while millions of people are starving around the world.  At least have the balls to admit it (but dont be proud of it).

====================================================
Date: December  6, 2007
 
Title: The Handwriting on the Wall
 
I recently attended a talk at Stanford by Walter Bradford Ellis, a too-little-known activist and writer on the issue of global poverty and world hunger. Its transcribed from a recording I made. The sound quality was lousy, so apologies if Ive mangled some of the specifics.
 
Good evening. This is the first time Ive spoken before a college audience, and therefore I would like to take advantage of your presence to ask you a few questions before I begin on my prepared speech. Basically I want to know how morally committed the students at a typical good school are, and while I know an audience of several hundred from one school is neither large enough nor diverse enough to give an especially accurate picture, still the results should provide a rough indication of where the real truth lies. Thats sort of an interesting juxtaposition of words. Truth lies I mean.
 
Anyway, as I said, Im interested in knowing how morally committed you are. I must say at the outset, I am pessimistic. At any rate, primarily what I want to find out tonight is how important it is to you for you to act according to your own definition of right and wrong. In other words Im not interested in knowing what sort of behavior you think is right or wrong but merely how committed you are to living up to whatever standards of right and wrong you possess.
 
I was trying to think a few minutes ago what questions I could ask you to find out this information, and it is very difficult to come up with anything satisfactory simply because individual standards of right and wrong vary so markedly. I had to pick a situation which seems perhaps a little silly because it is so improbable, but that is because I wanted as pure a case as possibleone which is in no way connected with any existing world situationso that your prejudices and preconceived notions about a particular situation will play no part in your answers.
 
My hypothetical circumstances are concerned with a person who murders innocent people, and I suspect that nearly every one of you will agree that that is wrong. So please now imagine yourself to be in an ancient country which is ruled over by an evil king who has absolute power of life or death over all his subjectsincluding yourself. Now this king is very bored, and so for his amusement he picks 10 of his subjects, men, women, and children, at random as well as an eleventh man who is separate from the rest. Now the king gives the eleventh man a choice: he will either hang the 10 people picked at random and let the eleventh go free, or he will hang the eleventh man and let the other 10 go free. And the eleventh man must decide which it is to be.
 
Now if death is bad, then on average 10 deaths must be 10 times as bad as one. So hopefully nearly all of you will agree that the eleventh man should give up his life in order that the other 10 might live. But that is not the question I am asking you. Im asking whether you would in fact make that sacrifice if you were the eleventh manif you really did have to decide whether you or they would die. And you knew the king meant business because he did this every year and sometimes killed the 10 people and other times the eleventh depending wholly upon what the eleventh had decided.
 
Now I am about to ask you for a show of hands, but of course I realize that few of you know yourselves so well that you can be certain of the correctness of your answerespecially if your answer is yes. So I will simply ask you to hold up your hand and answer yes if you are any more than 50% certain that you would make that sacrifice. Understand?
 
All right, all yes answers, please raise your hands. Let me see, that must be about a third of you. Thats more than I would have guessed.
 
Now let me ask only those who are reasonably certainsay 95% certainthat they would make the sacrifice to please raise their hands.
 
Yes. Thats more like what I expected. Thats at most a tenth of you. I have a feeling that most of that tenth of you are kidding yourselves, but perhaps human beings arent as selfish as I have always thought.
 
Now just two more quick questions. Same situation except that the king says he will let his 10 hostages go free if you will go to prison for 20 years, otherwise he kills them. Thats an easier question to be sure of your answer about than the previous one, so this time answer yes only if you are quite certain95% or better. All right everybody hold up his hand if he is at least 95% sure he would go to prison for 20 years in order to save 10 peoples lives.
 
Well that looks like about three-quarters of you. Again I think you have overly high opinions of yourselves, or maybe some of you are too embarrassed to tell the truth, but I sincerely hope you are correct in your self-assessments.
 
Just one question more now. The king says he will let his people go if you will agree to give him all the money you have and all the money you will make in the future, except of course enough for you to feed and house yourself and take care of all the absolute necessities. In other words hes asking you to be poor, but not so poor that it impairs your health in any way. Again Im asking for at least 95% certainty. All in that category please hold up your hands.
 
Well thats nearly every one of you! Im very pleased; I hope you mean it. Perhaps in fact you do this time. After all, since you have the power to decide whether 10 people die or whether you give up your money, if you made the other decision you would be killing 10 people in order to make money for yourself, and surely that is murder.
 
I see some head-shakingit looks as though a few of you disagree. The king has said, kill these 10 people or Ill take your money. If you kill them, that is murder.
 
Look at it another way. If you are poor and kill 10 people in order to steal their money, that is surely murder. But morally speaking, that situation is exactly the same as this one. In both situations if the people die, you will be rich; if they live, you will be poor, and it is within your power to decide which it is to be. In either situation if you decide that they should die in order that you can be rich, you have put your happiness, or not actually even that, you have put material riches for yourself above 10 peoples lives. That is the moral error you have made and it is exactly the same for both cases. One is as bad as the other and if one is murder so is the other.
 
Anyway, those are all the questions I wanted to ask you. I didnt mean to spend as much time on them as I did, but at least from my point of view it was well worth the time. Thanks for your indulgence, and also for your soul-searchingI guess those werent easy questions to answer if you answered them honestly. Just be happy it was a make-believe situation and none of you is likely ever to really be forced to make any of those rather unpleasant decisions.
 
And now Ill get on to what is supposed to be my topic: world hunger.
 
In 1650 the population of the world was 500 million (500M). Within the next 50 years an absolute minimum of 500M people will starve to death. The UN reports that around 10M people starve to death every year and the problem is only going to get worse as the population increases.
 
Perhaps that figure of 500M is too large for you to grasp in abstract terms. Let me translate it into something more concrete: if those 500M people were all to join hands, then figuring at about 1,000 people per mile, they would form a line long enough to stretch to the moon and backwith enough left over to reach across the United States 6 times. Or if you prefer keeping things more down to earth, they would reach 20 times around the world.
 
The US Armys M-16 machine-gun fires 700 rounds per minute, or about 12 rounds per second. If you drove a car past the line of people at a little over 40 miles per hour, you would pass 700 people every minute. If you used poisoned bullets or some such deadly concoction, you might be able to kill 1 person with every shot as you drove past. If you kept your finger on the trigger for 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, killing 1 person with every shot, it would take you 3 years and 4 months to kill them all.
 
It is a rather gruesome picture, and yet all these peopleand probably many moreare absolutely doomed to die in the next 25 to 50 years. And it wont be the quick, easy death of a bullet, but the slow, pitiful, wasting death of starvation.
 
There is one bright spot in all this, howeverthe legions of the doomed will not really reach quite 20 times around the world. Perhaps theyll really only reach 12 or 15 times around, for most of them are children and their arms are short.
 
Opposed to these ravaged peoples of the world are the gluttons of America. You yourselves are good examples. As future graduates of a good college, it is surely within the grasp of most of you to be making a salary, after taxes, of $50,000 or more within a few years. How much money is that? Well, you could easily take care of all the true necessities of life for $20,000, thus leaving you $30,000 for the luxuries. In America, anyone can stay healthy spending five dollars a day for food. It is not even hard to do. If one really skimps, he can stay alive and well for a dollarfor I have done it. If it can be done in America for a dollar a day, it can surely be done for that in the countries where people are starving. Thus your $30,000 of luxury money could be providing 82 people with a dollar worth of food a daypeople who otherwise might starve. Since presumably if your $30,000 were donated to UNICEF, they would take care to pick out poorer than average people, I think it not unreasonable to state that $30,000 per year over a period of 40 years is enough to keep healthy 10 people who would otherwise starve to deathplus a good many more who would otherwise be malnourished.
 
So you see, I lied to you a little while ago when I said none of you would ever have to make any of those three unpleasant decisions. You will never have to make the first or the secondthe two hardest choicesbut you are this moment confronted with the third: for the 10 who would otherwise starve are the 10 hostages, you are the eleventh man, and hunger is the king. Thus if you decide to go on with the life you were probably planning to lead, you will be letting 10 people die rather than give up your flat-screen television and your cocktail parties. And that is more than gluttony, it is murder.
 
Good evening.
 
Aaron again. Id like to make a few remarks about the speech, but before I do I should admit something. The speech was not given by Walter Bradford Ellis. Instead, it was written by a too-little-known philosopher named Louis Pascal. He published it in the 1980s under the same subterfuge in the journal Inquiry and it was reprinted in Peter Singers collection Applied Ethics. (I have modified it to bring the numbers up to date and shortened it a little to make it more blog-sized.) He justifies the subterfuge as necessary to get readers to more seriously engage in the thought experiment. I do think it would be wonderful to have this talk given in person, however. If you are interested in pursuing this, please let me know.
 
If you do want to help needy people, you can donate to UNICEF or Oxfam.

An obvious problem with the King scenario, is that one is not culpable for murders other people commit, even if they threaten you / ask you to tell them what to do - especially in the contra-command-flow structure presented in the story.
 
Its also interesting to wonder why it is that the fact that someone is suffering, that it is incumbent upon us to help. Why is that a moral duty? I, for one, dont accept it as an absolute moral duty. It certainly introduces a moral hazard - it can encourage people to wallow in suffering, to depend on future help. It may also be in ones self interest, in a democracy, to contribute to the poor via tax systems, to avoid revolution and help uphold the rule of law.
 
However, it would be madness for us all to forego our above-essential income, and flatten the distribution, because it has many of the problems of communism: lack of incentive to compete, lack of investment base for risky & experimental ventures, and congealing layers of bureaucracy feeding on income redistribution.

The questions are these: Do you oppose the deaths of innocent people? Are you willing to make personal sacrifices to stop it? Whether you think someone has a moral duty to prevent innocent people from being killed or whether someone is culpable for not intervening are up to you.
 
Similarly, are you seriously maintaining that promoting an incentive to compete and preventing congealing layers of bureaucracy are more important than the lives of millions?

Barry, youre going to have to come up with a far better justification than that to avoid looking like a miserable human being, in deep self-denial.
 
Not that your intuition is necessarily wrong, but you should think it through a bit more deeply.  If the only reason you can think of for helping people is that letting them get too desperate might result in violent revolution, well
 
On a more positive note, I hope that you spend some time with those in deep poverty, who, as human as the rest of us, will be happy to share their homes and meals with you, their stories and jokes, their hopes and dreams.  Perhaps it will help you to see the human side of the picture, and you can form a world view less dominated by abstract concepts like bureaucracies and tax systems.

This little guilt trip has a fatal flaw. Nowhere does this man conclusively prove that by giving my flatscreen TV, I save 10 peoples lives.
 
I agree that consumerism is out of control nowadays, but atleast prove your point. My mom always proved her point during the guilt trips she would send me on.

That seems not very well thought out. For one thing, it is not clear that donating to Unicef really helps very much. Another thing: what if I save those 10 people, but then they go on to have 50 children, that I cant feed anymore? Those 50 will die, so by saving the 10, I have killed 50. Just saying that the calculations are too simplistic. I think most people want to help, but it is not obvious what the best course of action would be.

@Aaron:
 
Do you oppose the deaths of innocent people?
 
I think the deaths of innocent people are lamentable, but there needs to be a cost-benefit analysis before conclusions are jumped to. For example, Wikipedia.org referencing NHTSA indicates at least 43,443 innocent people died in the US in 2005, without significant outcry - that is, on the road, in automobile accidents. People in the US clearly value the freedom of driving over the deaths of innocent people, for some value of freedom and for some (quite large) value of innocent deaths. Would you trying making a claim using similar logic that, because most people are opposed to deaths of innocent people, they should stop driving? These things are not absolute; that was the main thrust of my point, and why I used phrases like absolute moral duty and for us all to forego our above-essential income.
 
Are you willing to make personal sacrifices to stop it?
 
Sure, I make personal sacrifices all the time. However, I dont sacrifice everything non-essential, or even anything close to that, and nor does anyone else; and trying to browbeat people into feeling guilty because of that is wrong, I believe, for many reasons.
 
Whether you think someone has a moral duty to prevent innocent people from being killed or whether someone is culpable for not intervening are up to you.
 
How indirect does intervention need to be before Is it a moral duty to feed another family for the rest of their lives? And what does feeding them out of ones own economic surplus do to both those people, and the farmers in those regions who are trying to sell food to those hungry people? How does this altruistically-created dependency economy get better - i.e. whats the exit strategy?
 
Similarly, are you seriously maintaining that promoting an incentive to compete and preventing congealing layers of bureaucracy are more
important than the lives of millions?
 
Yes: I believe more people will be saved through the discovery of new technologies, new medicines, spread of education, integration of economies, than would be saved by sacrificing all of those things in order to save people right now. There needs to be a balance struck. These things are not absolute. Your argument just sounds too absolutist to me.

A big problem is that it really, really isnt obvious that giving money to UNICEF will save those lives. Aid really hasnt worked very well.
 
Most of the 10 children youre going to save arent born yet. If you spent the money on condoms, not food, would that also count? Or, perhaps, on giving the mother a factory job, which has been in many countries the first step to giving women more power, and they then choose to have less children. Does that count? And if you get the TV she assembled, does it compromise your moral standing?
 
You could, instead, give your money to an aid agency which saves women from dying in childbirth. How does this naive calculus of deaths count her unborn children who then get to die of hunger, later?

Barry, youre going to have to come up with a far better justification than that to avoid looking like a miserable human being, in deep self-denial.
 
Like most people, conveying ideas that seem relatively obvious to me is difficult without a relatively large investment in time, because of all the premises involved, explaining them and supporting them with references.
 
Not that your intuition is necessarily wrong, but you should think it through a bit more deeply. If the only reason you can think of for helping people is that letting them get too desperate might result in violent revolution, well
 
No, it isnt the only reason. But I also dont believe in truly altruistic acts, in the literal sense that there is no benefit whatsoever to the actor. And those benefits, i.e. those intrinsic motivations, arent necessarily aligned with the needs of those being helped, especially in dealing with world poverty which isnt nearly as simple as both yourself and Aaron seem to presume. The systemic effects need to be analyzed and cost-benefits evaluated. Absolute statements and emotional guilt-tripping are very poor substitutes for reasoning, and thats what I feel the post Aaron posted is guilty of.
 
On a more positive note, I hope that you spend some time with those in deep poverty, who, as human as the rest of us, will be happy to share their homes and meals with you, their stories and jokes, their hopes and dreams.
 
Indeed. I spent the Christmas and New Year of 2006/2007 travelling around Morocco (GDP per capita in PPP $4,000, according to CIA factbook) and saw many eye-opening things, which inform my less patronizing attitude today. Poor countries have economies too, perhaps even more complex than rich countries, and everyone, everyone, is trying to turn a buck all the time. Injection of subsistence aid undercuts subsistence economies; it can ruin people.
 
For more argument:
 
http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,363663,00.html
(Summary:
The Kenyan economics expert James Shikwati, 35, says that aid to Africa does more harm than good. The avid proponent of globalization spoke with SPIEGEL about the disastrous effects of Western development policy in Africa, corrupt rulers, and the tendency to overstate the AIDS problem.)
 
Not to mention, my own home circumstances were pretty modest: a child of unemployed parents in the west of Ireland in the 80s.
 
All this isnt to say that disaster aid, effectively providing a kind of insurance to poor countries, is a bad thing; quite the contrary.
 
Perhaps it will help you to see the human side of the picture, and you can form a world view less dominated by abstract concepts like bureaucracies and tax systems.
 
My view isnt dominated by abstract concepts, but rather by a synthesis of eyes on the ground, economic thinking and opinion pieces that I found convincing.

Oh man Barry likes to type! After your elaboration, you dont seem to be an idiot. Perhaps just pragmatic.
 
I think someone said about donating to Unicef. I think that is idiotic. They have a business model that revolves around needy people. To keep the model going, you need needy people.
 
Micro-financing is the way to go. It is win-win for everyone. The investors, and the borrowers.

So how about the people that starve since I no longer buy products with my extra money? How about instead of giving, we find ways for them to work for food?

this is me, thrashing. god its hard to give effective aid. as a giver, youre not only disconnected from the lives of these people, but from the accountability of the process. honestly, i want to give, but it goes so wrong so fast.
 
a hell of a lot of the worlds starvation is political. for instance, mugabe specifically starved the western part of zimbabwe because that was the seat of power for the opposition. so that gets to an interesting question. why in this example dont you try to kill the king? i mean, the king isnt hunger all the time. sometimes its just the goddamn king. i guess though if there was a pass the hat on hiring a hit on mugabe, id throw in my disposable income. unfortunately, those fuckers tend to be hard to kill.
 
but heres an odd fact- in the next 50 years more people are going to die of obesity related illnesses than starvation. they will be older on average than the ones that die of hunger, which makes them less attractive to help. so you have to ask yourself, at what age do they fall off your love list? and hell, how on earth do you throw money at a problem like that? right now your best bet is probably supporting diabetes research. unlike heart disease, that at least gets your money treating those cute, though fat, kids again.
 
heres another fun fact: malaria hits that 500 million mark a year. most cases dont lead to death, but many lead to short or long term disability. most of them, again, are kids. but nets might lead to starvation through environmental destruction, and fail to prevent the disease anyhow. weve got nowhere on the vaccine. do i get moral brownie points for investing in companies doing research on diabetes and malaria? i have no frickin clue. this shit is hard.
 
outside of assassination and vaccination, for my money your best bet is doctors without borders. theyre not picky about how youre dying, theyre just trying to stop it. but hell, i am still stuck hoping they dont turn out to be corrupt.

Instead of nitpicking about effectiveness of aid, if we should give them money or food or condoms, complaining that we are discussing about hunger instead of X (e.g. children dead on road accidents, drugs, war, disease), which are just ways of ignoring the real question, we should discuss the ideas proposed, shouldnt we?
 
@Aaron: Do you oppose the deaths of innocent people?
 
What does this even mean? Opposing death is (in a sense) like opposing gravity. Its something that happens and (in the end) cant be avoided. Of course we can do something to extend peoples life and avoid certain forms of death (e.g. most kinds of disease, hunger, war), but we can only do as much.
 
So the question is not opposing to the deaths of innocent people but opposing to avoidable deaths of innocent people.
 
Also I question this innocent label, most people arent and even if when theyre not usual claims of justice dont favor killing the guilty (unless its part of the judicial system), so it shouldnt matter to most forms of popular western morality if we are feeding (or giving jobs or medicine) the innocent or the guilty.
 
Then we reduce the question to: Do you oppose to avoidable deaths of people?
 
My answer is it depends. I oppose to the deaths of people I care (i.e. family, friends, community) but otherwise I dont care (nor expect for others to care about me). If I have to choose between providing better to my family and strangers life (i.e. assuming that Im not directly responsible for their situation) I would choose my family almost everyday.
 
Currently my family isnt spending much beyond essential things (i.e. housing, food, cheap clothes and medicine), we save and invest what we can. My choice is: do I want to spend this surplus on someone elses life today or do I want to increase this wealth and be more effective later.
Wealth isnt a constant resource, we can increase it through many means (e.g. if we create means to use resources (e.g. agriculture, energy) more efficiently we increase productivity and wealth). The choice we have to make is save one life today or save many years later. Should Warren Buffet have spent its money on charities or increased it million fold and then used it to help others. Ditto for Bill Gates.
 
My choice is to improve my wealth to the point I can become independently wealth and then help others, because its much more efficient and effective to do it this way. Also I will help others only because at this point spreading wealth improves global wealth better than my personal actions will do. If I did it otherwise I know I wouldnt be doing the best to increase the worlds wealth. Today I know that I could feed  50 people with the economic surplus I have (ignoring investments), but in ten to twenty years I will help feeding at least a thousand, just because I wisely invested my surplus for the past ten years and plan to continue doing so.
 
Are you willing to make personal sacrifices to stop it?
 
If someone says that they oppose something but arent willing to make personal sacrifices then they dont really oppose it. So inasmuch as I dont really oppose it Im not willing.

Wow, someone actually made the dont help UNICEF, they require needy people, so youre only helping perpetuate poverty argument.
 
By that logic we shouldnt pay teachers. Teachers only educate the ignorant, so they require a large population that lives in ignorance. Helping teachers do their jobs must therefore, I infer, perpetuate ignorance.

UNICEF doesnt have to do a darned thing to maintain the population of hungry people, and we dont seem to have crested the wave of idiots either.
 
Everybody wants a piece of my wallet. I can feed hungry kids or I can dig clean wells. I can give to my church or to the Red Cross. If I give all my money to UNICEF, theres nothing left for Amnesty International.
 
Which is more important, helping to free a political prisoner in China or giving a laptop to a poor kid? Should I help flood victims in Bangladesh and Indonesia, or bums in Chicago? Should you build a house for someone in New Orleans or support your local theater? Is it more important for people to think or to breathe? Is one American worth three Kenyans? Is one Kenyan worth three Americans?

Sohail - careful about micro finance. The incentive of micro lenders is to achieve the highest possible repayment rate. Repayment rate is seen as the best indicator of a programs success, and so the micro lenders push extremely hard to reach repayment rates of 90-95% How likely is it that the success rate of businesses in developing countries is actually this high? The strain of reaching 95% payback rates on loans often forces the poor women who receive them to resort to prostitution.
 
I think we should work hard to solve these problems, but it is important to understand that there is no panacea.

I think someone made the point that a lot of it is political. I would tend to agree with that. Perhaps my suggestion not to donate to Unicef is idiotic but the teacher analogy isnt appropriate. You dont benefit from keeping people ignorant. Those people just dont go to school and go flip burgers.
 
My beef with Unicef-like agencies is that a lot of them focus on crisis-mitigation rather than crisis-prevention. But Lloyd brings up a good point, there is no panacea. But I would tend to side with an agency whose specific mandate was to alleviate poverty, not feed people.

This is that kind of argument that is superficially compelling, but doesnt really make a lot of sense.
 
Has anyone ever worked out what the consequences of the citizens of a large industrialized nation changing their spending habits in the suggested way would be?  Economic collapse doesnt seem out of the question.  And then who is going to be sending out charity money?
 
Problems like starvation, and other deadly effects of poverty, are serious and tragic and difficult to approach, and hard to wrap your head around properly.  But they arent well served by silly arguments.

Barry:
 
Its nice to hear that your original statement was an exaggerated and oversimplified version of your views on the topic. Your responses make you no longer seem like a miserable miser. :)
 
Like most people, conveying ideas that seem relatively obvious to me is difficult without a relatively large investment in time
 
Sure it takes time, but the time is spent in reflection, thinking through the argument, not in the explanation, and yours still has a ways to go.
 
As for the best way of approaching big problems like global poverty and hunger:  It is all to easy to lull ourselves into thinking that donations of monetary or food aid will solve the challenges facing developing countries (almost as easy as ignoring them altogether and doing nothing).  These countries desperately need political and social change, investment in manufacturing, improvements in education and healthcare, construction of critical infrastructure, etc., and dumping foreign grain into the hands of their officials is at best a stop-gap measure, useful in stopping mass death in severe crises, but hardly an effective long-term development strategy.
 
What should we do (speaking as an American)?  Thats a tricky question, but suspending military aid to corrupt dictatorial regimes, committing more fully to the U.N. and global dialog instead of constantly catering to corporate agendas, spending research dollars on development problems, alternative energy, etc. instead of military technology, stopping large-scale sales of small arms to military and paramilitary groups with histories of turning them on local civilian populations, etc. would be good starts.
 
Foreign aid would stretch further if it were devoted to communications and transportation infrastructure, schools, hospitals, etc., employed local workers, rather than highly paid American contractors, and wasnt premised around, for instance, deals to secure oil reserves for American and European companies.
 
And as for Aarons post:  It is the kind of polemical moral argument meant to kick up a discussion, rather than a serious suggestion that we all donate our life savings to Oxfam and start living on $5/day.  And as a conversation starter, it is quite effective.  Kudos.
 
Q said:
 
how on earth do you throw money at a problem like [deaths from obesity]?
 
A good start would be forming national and international agriculture and food policies decreasing the price of real food, giving it a chance against the processed chemical mixtures most westerners eat.  After that, we can start in on advertising directed at children, better research into foods effect on the body, etc.  Not that this is likely to happen, given the immense power of the big agriculture lobby (ADM, et al.) in America.

Aaron, I think it is time to connect you with Lilos blog. Please follow her actions in future, and feel free to contact her/me if you want. I wanted to present you my tool earlier, but I guess the mails I sent to you were too wild: Once again, the Aaron in this story has nothing to do with you. I started to write about this character years before I stumbled over your blog. But when I did so - and started to realize half a year later,when returning, that you seem to be out for the same, I thought your group would be the right one to create the tool open source. Until now, I could only find investors, who want to earn money with it. But it will be free though, as we start with the universtiy now.
Lilos actual blog is just a try-out for the bigger project, but it happened, that I need it, because a lot of very special people will work togehter with me, who are not yet used to new media, and I want to lead them into the project step by step.
 
I have exactly your view - but I think we ( all of us) will have to be tricky in a nice way, to attract people, otherwise they are not able to take this step. The most fascinating way (as to my theory) will be, to engage them for and enable them to create/support aid-projects they are part of, either by taking part, or by creating them from the start - this is possible : if it starts gamebased. Like my project  in a virtual world, and starting with their own personal needs. (You can not reach the many, without the one  (Plato))
 I just read your post and answer immediately:  That I wanted to talk about Open Library in my next post, was due to the clareness of your presentation. (link/mailinglist) - It is a great project: It focusses on aims beyond financial aspects - shows that such projects have to be not only open source but on purpose designed in a way that enables any user to go deeper.
 I wanted to explain step by step,  how to approach virtual architecture as powerfull addition to such 2-d-web-tools, using Open Librabry as first and quite difficult example, which I realized, as soon as I started to design. Virtual worlds offer some not yet fully taken possibilites to create:
 Attraction, View, Explanation, Engagement, Interactionand in special: Selection, the possibility to present the most valuable selection, embedded into guiding architecture at a changing virtual representation-structure, like exhibitions in a real museum 
Open Library is so powerful, because you and your group love books - and have thought of the dream of how to be able to work or just act with this love - in addition and even leading back to reallife librabries-  you did not think about any financial aspects - you want to engage, motivate and enable humans to interact, get committed and go deeper. You engaged, for what you love  and there is always a possibility to engage for what you love in order to help others at the same time  actually this ist he most fulfilling way to engage.
These should be the goals of new media projects.
And there should be a creative method to motivate and engage others for the creation of such projects. The interaction possibilities of virtual worlds are perfect for this. There is a special project  for the One Laptop Per Child-project included into the big picture, that is related to Lilos storytelling you will be able to follow the project now.

As I see it, the concept of giving money for the aid of the poor is already working in a variety of forms: from UNICEF to the global brands opening production plants in underdeveloped countries, paying minimum-possible wages and offering a maximum competitively priced product to its western customer. Arguing the donation of ones complete extra income is proving extreme, and a bit difficult, since theres only the emotional note to rely on. The same reasoning could lead to the decision of donating more than your income on a regular basis. And since a considerable percentage of participants chose to be imprisoned in order to save other peoples lives, the decision would stand out, too!

I have a suggestion in mind for the problem of hunger. Imagine if the President of United States would declare that we would unilaterally feed every starving person in the world. At 10 million people in the world , this comes to 3.65 billion dollars annually at a dollar a day. This might seem like a huge number , but put it against the annual defense budget which is of the order of 532.8 billion dollars. Which means that for less than 1/100 of the defense budget we can eliminate starvation. Such a proposal does not need to be imposed on the citizens of the United States. I believe that it would be whole heartedly accepted
by them.

When Africa has to worry about the social and economic problems of the welfare state, i think you wont be able to call them a third world country any more.  i think we do have a moral and ethical duty to help the best way we can, when we see tragedy in the making.  i do not think the best way is always complete self sacrifice.  Whether you admire or depise Bill Gates or Warren Buffet, do you really think their causes would have been be best addressed by their giving all their disposable income to various charities, thus leaving nothing for them to invest to create the empires they now have?  having amassed this large amount of capital, they are putting it to use in a way that is much more profound than silly cakes i cooked as an elementary schoolgirl in the sixties, giving the proceeds to CARE.  Sure, that was an admirable thing to do, for me, mostly, to advance my education in morals and ethics.  But i doubt it saved very many lives.  Guilt cannot overwhelm our better sense, and is ultimately very destructive to the guilty and the source of the guilt.  Better to put the mask over your face first when the plane goes down, but never forget your moral duty to save those that could not.

Title: Sick
 
Im sorry I havent been keeping up with Bubble City. Ive spent a lot of the last few weeks lying in bed and drinking fluids. (With occasional breaks to play Rock Band, much to the annoyance of my neighbors.) Once again, Ive been sick  this time, with four different illnesses.
 
I have a lot of illnesses. I dont talk about it much, for a variety of reasons. I feel ashamed to have an illness. (It sounds absurd, but there still is an enormous stigma around being sick.) I dont want to use being ill as an excuse. (Although I sometimes wonder how much more productive Id be if I wasnt so sick.) And, to a large extent, I just dont find it an interesting subject. (My friends are amazed by this; why is such a curious person so uncurious about the things so directly affecting his life?)
 
One of my goals for this blog is to describe what its like to be in various situations and it struck me that Ive never said much about what its like to be sick. So I figured Id try to remedy that. (Unfortunately, being sick has made this slightly more difficult. I started this post on thanksgiving and now its almost four days later.)
 
Cold: All the time I feel tired and woozy. My throat is sore and Im constantly searching for kleenex to address my nose. Sometimes I feel too hot, like Im burning up. Im always thirsty. Concentrating on anything is difficult. I just feel kind of wasted.
 
Upset stomach: Huge pains grind through my stomach, like its trying to leap out of my body. Food is always followed by pain, followed by running to the bathroom. Im afraid to go out because I wouldnt want to get too far from a toilet. Im always thirsty and the dehydration makes me angry and confused. At times the pain is excruciating and even after it goes I spend some time just reeling from it.
 
Migraine: Ever felt someones nails dig into your scalp? Imagine that their nails are knives and theyre scratching thru your brain and you can begin to imagine what a migraine feels like. Light, sound, touch  everything makes it worse, making the most painful pains even more painful. Even when you quell it with a pill, you still end up feeling woozy and disconnected, as if the pill is just barely keeping the pain at bay.
 
Depressed mood: Surely there have been times when youve been sad. Perhaps a loved one has abandoned you or a plan has gone horribly awry. Your face falls. Perhaps you cry. You feel worthless. You wonder whether its worth going on. Everything you think about seems bleak  the things youve done, the things you hope to do, the people around you. You want to lie in bed and keep the lights off. Depressed mood is like that, only it doesnt come for any reason and it doesnt go for any either. Go outside and get some fresh air or cuddle with a loved one and you dont feel any better, only more upset at being unable to feel the joy that everyone else seems to feel. Everything gets colored by the sadness.
 
At best, you tell yourself that your thinking is irrational, that it is simply a mood disorder, that you should get on with your life. But sometimes that is worse. You feel as if streaks of pain are running through your head, you thrash your body, you search for some escape but find none. And this is one of the more moderate forms. As George Scialabba put it, acute depression does not feel like falling ill, it feels like being tortured  the pain is not localized; it runs along every nerve, an unconsuming fire.   Even though one knows better, one cannot believe that it will ever end, or that anyone else has ever felt anything like it.
 
The economist Richard Layard, after advocating that the goal of public policy should be to maximize happiness, set out to learn what the greatest impediment to happiness was today. His conclusion: depression. Depression causes nearly half of all disability, it affects one in six, and explains more current unhappiness than poverty. And (important for public policy) Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy has a short-term success rate of 50%. Sadly, depression (like other mental illnesses, especially addiction) is not seen as real enough to deserve the investment and awareness of conditions like breast cancer (1 in 8) or AIDS (1 in 150). And there is, of course, the shame.
 
So I hope youll forgive me for not doing more. And hey, it could be worse. At least I have decent health insurance.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

Hey Aaron,
 
I was depressed for about 18 months before I admitted to myself I needed help.
 
SSRIs and counseling helped me get over the worst of it, and the experience helped me identify when Im started to feel depressed so I can nip it in the bud.
 
For me, there are two things that help when I feel depressed:
1) Having interesting conversations with new people. Though the last thing I want to do is go to a bar or party, if I force myself to go out with some friends and talk to new people, I return feeling invigorated for days. (This is in contrast to my usual mood; Im generally introverted and feel wiped out from socializing in big groups.)
 
2) Setting a goal that requires discipline. Being disciplined about one thing makes it easier to face the rest of my tasks. Some of my goals have been:
* run 25 miles per week
* give up caffeine (oh, the headaches)
* give up alcohol
* thoroughly clean one room each day
 
Anyway, I can relate to how youre feeling, and I hope your health gets better soon. Maybe the above suggestions will help.
 
Cheers,
Aaron

Hi,
 
Feeling ashamed is usual when someone has any non-stop conditions. Its worse when people feel pity about us or try to offer advice, we start thinking that we should never talked about it in the first place.
 
I have a migraine problem for seven years now, sometimes entire weeks pass with my head hurting non-stop, nothing making it better. Doctors never found cure or cause. Eventually I learned to live with it, but it doesnt hurt less.
 
Also been living with depression since the early nineties. Therapy helped for a while, pills didnt make real difference, what really helped me is creating comfort zones for my worst fears (i.e. the things that I thought when depressed). For example I was terrified about being unable to get better and work, then losing my job, so I saved every penny I could and now I can pay for years of bills if necessary. While these dont avoid depression, I know that Im safe against my fears. Perhaps this can help you anyhow.
 
Regards, Daniel.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C_megadosage
Try megadosing (20+g/day) on Vitamin C .  Linux Pauling thought it worked.  Even if it doesnt, the placebo effect will relieve your pain naturally.  I use to regularly feel awful with sore throats. Its done wonders for me.
 
Upset stomach
My cousin had an upset stomach yesterday.  My aunt made him eat only simple bread and water.
Take the vitamin C with a meal or an antacid or youll definitely feel pain from the acidity.
 
Migraine
I dont have any experience with this. Ive read that magnesium can help: http://www.ctds.info/magnesium-migraine.html
 
Depressed mood
I feel this way a lot too.  I should really study my mood in a scientific way (http://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/117/).  It seems to oscillate.
 
I remember one time recently that I got out of a slump.  I started to list all of the accomplishments of my life.  I wrote it in this style: http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/joke/essay.htm
 
Ive done quite a bit for my age.  I started to make a really long list that was very impressive and ironic.  Reading over it, I was surprised. I noticed that my mood was better afterwards.
 
Maybe thatll work for you too.  Or maybe I just naturally shifted moods and making the list was coincidental.

Have you looked into potential dietary changes since your post some time back about proper nutrition?  Also, have you found the changing of the seasons (sunlight, weather) to affect you negatively or positively?
 
On the last point, when Im feeling down I often, err, find reading my old blog posts often cheers me up.  Looking back at what I was doing or thinking about a few years ago around the same time is interesting and memory-evoking, at least for me.  But maybe not for everyone.

I think a lot of geeks get depression, it appears to go with the territory. Although I think a lot of ppl dont talk about it for the reasons youve mentioned.
 
I used to take large doses of vitamin C (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berocca - cant believe theres a wiki entry for it!). It definetely helps with the colds! It also seem to have some sort of physical effect on how your body feel, very slight, more energy, slighly light headed. For the first few days you can kid yourself that this stuff is awesome and its a panacea for your depression. But after a while you realise that its all just placebo and if you try (or under the right circumstances) - you still cant get out of bed and face the day.
 
Does it help that I told you that? Probably not - but you would have found out soon or later :(
 
Im not says vitamins are completely rubbish - a good balanced diet is important. But I think a bit of councelling is also useful. Or takes the other Aarons advice: do the opposite of councelling, take you mind of your life by meeting new ppl. Ive found that helps a lot (but Im often too lazy to keep in touch and the bed just calls to me, like a warm and cozy womb to crawl back too, away from anything that can hurt me its a lie but I dont care)
 
Also (my last 2 cents, for what its worth) if you can - try to control your ruminations. If anything in life, they can make or break you.

What you label as upset stomach sounds like it could be IBS to me. I used to get that sort of thing (though with slightly different symptoms) when I was younger, though its gone away with a move to a much healthier diet (specifically, a lot more fiber, fruit, and vegetables). Lack of fiber tends to make any digestive issue worse (for most people - some people get worse with extra fiber).
 
I suffer from migraines as well - in my 20s if I got home and got to sleep when the aura was still around, I would be okay. If not, Id be throwing up and out of it for 5 or 6 hours.
 
I only get one or so a year now that Im old(er), and those usually resolve with an OTC migraine remedy, or something with caffeine in it.
 
Finally, regular exercise can have a good effect on all the things you listed

Hi Aaron!
 
I just read the comments ( first time, I was really courious) and had to laugh:
 
Outing first: I am not interested in my illnesses, work like hell, cant feel my left hand since about 7 days, (it started with the little finger) - and do not want to know what it might be (besides a brain tumor due to 13 years of addiction to coke light. Sometimes unrequested information just jumps into a surfers face.)  But obviously I know more thanks to self-experimenting than I thought:
 
If you have a problem with your stomach - I would not really recommend the combination of megadoses vitamin C (which by the way will give you some creepy experiences of hot and cold added to the ones you have) AND magnesium (especially no overdose in this case, this will drive your stomach mad) while only eating a piece of bread and thinking of that you have reached most of what others do in all their life as a teenager and the big plans of saving the world or making it a better place seem so logic and are realizeable- but are simply not wanted somehow - 
@ Q :  I was not really sure if you seriously wanted to help him or  ;-) but the essay is great :-)
 
I do not really want to give you advices, but maybe you want them. 
I recommend an adventure - and to invent a trick, in order to be able to have and realize plans and goals that are considered and experienced as impossible, but live happy though. 
When I tried to dismiss mine, I found myself falling into depths my great experiences of black holes had not even touched gradually.
(I am sure I would live happy, if I my day had about 72 hours (maybe a little more)  only my day, while all the others go on with 24 )

Im not a huge fan of the traditional medical system, but Id hope youd be open to trying all sorts of stuff to see if anything helps. Have you consulted a doctor?
 
If theres anything I can do to help, please let me know.

Hi. FWIW
 
I found that when I was coping with what I didnt even know was depression, the worst thing was that I felt nobody understood or could understand what I was feeling. I accidentally ran across a book in a Cambridge MA bookstore called Depression: The Way Out of Your Prison that showed me that people DID understand, and that was my first step to becoming free of it.
 
Also, as others note, this is the time for Seasonal Affective Depression, especially if you are in the Northeast; get a lamp.
 
I also recommend a daily walk, hopefully in the sun. Just do that one thing.
 
I am so sorry to read this post; obviously youve been making all sorts of interesting and wonderful contributions.
 
All the best.

Hi Aaron,
 
Thanks for writing about your sickness, for sharing it with us all.  As a depressive I know how difficult it can be to talk about, to admit - a kind of shame on top of the sense of hopelessness or dread. I found what you have written very interesting and moving.
 
I thought I might mention a book I found very interesting: Unholy Ghost: Writers on Depression, edited by Nell Casey - a perspective you may appreciate.
 
I know all of this is something that you can only go through in your own way. But I just wanted to add my voice in saying there are many of us who get a lot out of what you write, who care about how you are doing and who wish you all the very best.

You have stolen many words which were locked up in my head. Or that of many others.
 
There is an interesting line in The Great Gatsby about how a sick man (not only feels but also) looks very very guilty, as if he had just brought a girl with a child (may not be exact words).
 
The relation between sickness and guilt has long fascinated me.
 
Actually, depressed me is more correct.

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 10
 
Wayne met Samuel, his Google contact, at a San Francisco bar. They were already several drinks in when the conversation turned to business.Well, Ive got the Center all up and running, he said. Thats great to hear. Congratulations. Thats just fantastic. Theres just one problem. Oh? I dont know what to do with it. Oh, dont worry. You can do whatever you want. I mean, well have some requests from time to time but its your project  feel free to do whatever you want to do.
 
But thats just what I mean, Wayne said. I dont know what I want to do. Come on, surely there must be something? Not really. What are you working on these days? Oh, all sorts of things. You know, its pretty crazy as usual. Youre on the Google NDA right? Yeah, and the corporate email system and contracts and everything. OK, so then I can tell you a bit. You know how the job is: tracking down people to co-opt or destroy. Must be exciting.
 
Not usually. Although one exciting thing happened lately. Were doing a manhunt on this NNA stuff. A what? Apparently some kid found out something he wasnt supposed to and were tracking him down. Huh? Tracking him down? Well, he booked when he found out we were on his tail, so we get to use all our databases to try and figure out where he fled to and how to get him back. Hes a smart kid  MIT grad, hacker, etc.  so its actually a really fun puzzle. The guys back at HQ are loving it. Its like their college puzzle hunts all over again.
 
So what do you do when you find him? Wayne asked. The usual, Samuel said as if it was obvious. Co-opt or destroy. But how do you destroy a kid? Oh, thats actually quite fun, although obviously not ideal for the bottom line. Basically we take him out and then falsify a whole bunch of evidence to make it look like an accident. You wouldnt believe the quality of the data forgers we have on staff  best guys in the business.
 
Wait? Take him out  you mean youll kill him? Not usually; bodies are messy to clean up that way. Usually we just expose them to chemicals or shocks or some other brain-rotting substance. They live, but not with an IQ that will be of any worry for us. Wow, geez, Wayne said, a bit taken aback. I had no idea Google did stuff like that. Oh, come on, Wayne, dont be naive. You of all people should know better than that. Oh, Im not be Its just the price of doing business, Samuel continued. Every company has its little hidden costs. Factories dump harmful chemicals wherever seems convenient. Pharmaceutical companies cover up their products harms. Conglomerates bribe foreign governments. Clothing companies engage in human trafficking. Scratch any serious company and youll find some dark little secret. Thats what makes the money go round.
 
Yes, but well, taking people out. Isnt that a bit extreme? Oh, so when Shell takes out labor activists, thats OK. And when GAP condemns young women to a life of involuntary servitude, thats OK. And when GE dumbs tons of PCBs into the Hudson River, thats just fine. But Google messes with one or two people and its suddenly the end of the world? How is that fair?
 
Look, Wayne, Googles one of the ten biggest US companies. If you think were going to keep acting like some little software shop in Mountain View, youre crazy. I know, I know, but I thought Google was supposed to be different. What happened to Dont Be Evil? Samuel laughed. Dont Be Evil was some hackers PR ploy that got out of hand. Paul Buchheit, the guy who made Gmail, suggested it in an early meeting and Amit Patel, another early Googler starting writing it on whiteboards everywhere. A journalist saw it and the rest was history  but dont be mistaken, it was never official corporate policy.
 
But come on, Samuel, just between us, dont you ever feel a little bit guilty about all this? Look Wayne, what good would it do? If I raise complaints about it to my superior theyll mark me as unstable and demote me. If I threaten to go public theyve got an ironclad NDA  theyll take away my house and family with their crack team of lawyers and Ill spend the rest of my life at a minimum wage job. And if even that doesnt scare me, then theyll turn the black ops on me too. When theyre through with me, Ill be such a gibbering paranoid idiot that nobody will take anything I say seriously. So its stupid to even think about this stuff.
 
But what about your superior? Why not convince him? Come on, Wayne, you cant even convince me this is the wrong thing; you think Im going to be able to convince a guy who does this sort of thing his entire life? And even if I do, then what? He gets fired and ruined right along with me. Why bring another person in on this mess? What good does that do?
 
Wayne took a long sigh. But surely, at some fundamental level, youve got to realize this is wrong? Has Google entirely taken away your humanity? Oh come on, Wayne, thats not humanity, thats naievete. Sure, when theyre a kid everyone thinks theyll fight for truth and justice and the American way of not torturing people. But you also want to succeed. And success requires compromise; theres no other way. If you dont compromise then they just filter you out. Youre labeled difficult or uncooperative or insubordinate. Believe me; Ive seen it dozens of times. Ive even done it myself when it had to be done. By the time you get to a position like mine, you begin to realize that this is just the way the world works. And what are you supposed to do about that, huh, Wayne?
 
Look Wayne, Im telling you all this because I know youre a smart guy. Your hearts in the right place, but so is your head. Googles counting on you to be a big success and you cant do stuff like that if you have to worry about every little kid that needs to be quashed. So here, Ill pick up the tab. Why dont you go home and get yourself some rest? And then tomorrow Ill give you a call and well pick out some fun projects for you to work on? Doesnt that sound good?
 
Yeah, Wayne said at last. I guess so. God, I dont know whats gotten into me. I used to be such a hard-head. I know, Wayne, I know. Thats what I like about you. You did whatever it took to get ahead. Look, everyone goes thru this the first time they have to cross a line. I certainly had my fair share of sleepless nights. But you come out of it smarter and stronger. I promise you, you wake up tomorrow morning, youll be a better man  ready to conquer anything. Now go and get some rest. OK, Samuel. And thanks for the drinks. Dont thank me, Samuel said. Thank Google.

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 9
 
Derren, head of sensitive public relations operations for Google, had to figure out what to do about Jason. Normally Google prided itself on being very flat  few people were in charge, most people worked in teams. But the bosses had decided that public relations had to be special, which meant that all these tough choices fell on Derrens shoulders alone.
 
But Derren knew better than that. Hed previously had a similar position at Yahoo, where the Chinese government made him give up the names of bloggers to their secret police. The guilt wouldnt go away for weeks. Derren was sick of that kind of stress.
 
Google was a company of hackers, so when he moved there he got there he had the programmers whip up a technical solution to his social problem. Now when he faced a tough decision like this, he punched the key facts into the computer and had his team vote on the solution. That way it wasnt his decision  it was simply the wisdom of crowds, the aggregated knowledge of Googles crack team of spooks.
 
Describing Jasons case would be simple:
 
Fresh MIT grad discovers backdoor in key public algorithm. Works at related SF startup. Doesnt yet have enough details to go public.
 
Should we:
 
He always left that last one in there just to make sure his ass was covered. But it almost never got any votes.
 
He sent out the questionnaire and watched the results pour in. There was the support from the kidnapping crowd for immediately seizing the kid and figuring out the questions later, but most of the team supported the more cautious position. Fair enough.
 
He looked to see what staff he had available and dispatched one woman to get more details from the kids boss, just to make sure he was oblivious and dispatched a guy to get to know the kids girlfriend. Finally, he assigned an office drone to monitor the kid and keep tabs on his progress. The guy whod done the original work-up was still available, so he pushed the task back to him.
 
Boy, this job sure was easier without the guilt.
 
Jason started noticing them at the gym. Guys that geeky didnt work out. And certainly not with those dorky glasses still on. And whenever he biked anywhere he was followed by an unusually large number of white Priuses. At first he ascribed things to paranoia  hed been having weird dreams ever since his visit to Miller == but when he got to the office he ran some numbers and calculated the probability of seeing that many white Priuses in San Francisco and realized something was up.
 
Dorks. Priuses. His work on NNA. What did it all add up to? Did the media industry have some secret San Francisco team working on the NNA backdoor? No, that couldnt be  anyone the media industry hired would be way more attractive. And then it hit him  the only organization that fit the combination of stealthiness, geekiness, and obsessive control: Google.
 
Shit, he thought.
 
He looked around to see how they were tracking on him. Open on his screen was a Google query for white priuses in San Francisco. Fuck, he thought, quickly closing it. They knew he was on to them; they were sure to close in on him now. He quickly set up a rule in his firewall to block all outgoing connections to Google servers. He watched his other search queries, his email, his calendar, and his chats all go dead. Soon his desktop search thing fizzled out too.
 
He tried to think of other Google products, but his officemate was laughing at some stupid YouTube video. Oh, damn, YouTube. He blocked that too, along with Blogger. In fact, he blocked the whole Google IP space. There was time to figure out how to circumvent this stuff later.
 
He looked around for other Google products. Surely they couldnt track him with his Google tshirts. But his phone! It not only ran Google apps, but a Google OS. He had to toss it. He removed the battery, ran a magnet over the case, and tossed the result in the trash. In fact, maybe itd just be safer to toss his whole computer as well. At the very least, he changed the password on his hard drive encryption and removed the battery and power cord and stuffed it in his bag.
 
Shit, the dorks were at the receptionist. He had to get out. He ducked under his desk so he could think. Soon theyd be at his desk. He couldnt be here. He vaguely recalled seeing some back door over by the bathrooms, so he crawled that way. Luckily, most of the office was too enthralled by their monitors to notice.
 
He snuck out the door and jogged to the BART station. He bought a new ticket, with cash (just to be on the safe side  hadnt he heard something about Google beta-testing a new public transit program?) He rode the train all the way to Bay Point, on the theory that getting as far away from Google as possible would be a good idea right now.
 
He spent the whole train ride shifty and nervously looking at the other passengers, seeing if any of them were suspiciously geeky. But few people seemed to last the whole ride from San Francisco to Bay Point; mostly they got rotated. So eventually he calmed down and tried to plot his next move.
 
When he got off he began looking for a library where he might be able to get an Internet connection. He was obviously a bit wary of using Google, even though itd be pretty impressive for them to track him from a random library computer, so he went to scroogle.org, a site that let you do Google searches while hiding your IP address. Instead of visiting Google directly, you sent your query to Scroogle, which passed the query on to Google and then back to you, after stripping out all the Google tracking cookies and the ads.
 
For other Google products there was Tor, a clever little app that encrypted your Internet usage and bounced it through three machines around the world before sending it on to its intended destination. At every step, your traffic gets encrypted a different way and delayed a small amount, so that even an observer listening to every single bit of Internet traffic cant keep track of which was yours.
 
Think of it this way: Imagine you want to get across town without being followed by a spy satellite that can see everything from overhead. Well, first you leave your house  the spy satellite can see that, of course  and you head to a department store. Inside the department store, you toss your clothes and buy all new ones. Then, when you come out, you look like a completely different person  the guy using the spy satellite cant tell which person leaving the store is you. Then, just in case the guy using the spy satellite cut a deal with the department stores security cameras, you do this a couple more times with different department stores. Finally, pretty confident youve lost the spy, you head to your final destination.
 
Tor works the same way, only instead of you theres your message and instead of new clothes theres encryption. You first pick out three Tor servers (the equivalent of the department store) that you want to route your message to. First you write out a note saying please send the following message to www.google.com with the message and encrypt it so that only the third computer on your list can read it. Then you write out please send this to [the third Tor server] and the previous encrypted message and encrypt that. And then you write out please send this to [the second Tor server] and the previous encrypted message. Then you encrypt that and send it to the first computer on your list. It decrypts it, follows the instructions, and all the other servers do the same.
 
Of course all of this was for nothing if you ever logged into a Google product or even accepted a Google cookie  a special tracking number that Google send out with every web page they serve. Most browsers automatically save the tracking number and send it back every time you visit something on google.com. Cookies were designed so that when you logged into something like your email, you would stay logged in. The first time you typed your email and password, youd get back a cookie proving youd logged in. Then, every other time you visited the site, your browser would send back the cookie and the site would know you were logged in.
 
But pretty quickly, sites started using this to track all their visitors. Instead of sending cookies only when you logged in, they sent them to every user, allowing them to keep track of people even when they took their laptop to a new place or disguised their connections through something like Tor. Google, of course, does the same, giving every Google visitor a tracking number that identifies their computer forever.
 
Thus, to be sure Google cant track you, you need to do at least three things: never long in, never accept tracking cookies, and use some kind of anonymization of your IP address (like Scroogle or Tor). And thats just for the Web.
 
God, this was going to be hard.

I didnt realise Scroogle had an SSL interface, nice. Although it does beg the question, who promotes Scroogle? Can you trust them? Using their service is just choosing to use them instead of Google. Maybe Ill start using Scroogle through Tor :)

A few more suggestions:
 
Jason seems to have figured out Google way too quickly doesnt seem realistic.
 
Also, the paragraphs about Tor and Google anonymization seems to be too out-of-place for a story like this.

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 8
 
Poly? Yeah, poly, she said, hunting for her shirt and putting it back on. No sense in being that forward when she answered the door. You mean like polygamous? No, silly, do I look like I have multiple wives? I just have that one You hawait, so what does poly mean? Polyamorous, she said, putting her socks back on. Jason saw her heading to the door and realized he better put on some more clothes of his own. Because putting on some more clothes of Sarahs seemed wrong for the mood. Multiple loves. Jason scurried towards his pants. I dont instantly assume that just because Im seeing one person that means I cant see another. Jason tried to pull the pants up while avoiding any unsightly bulges. I just dont sign on to that arbitrary rule of our culture.
 
But its not arbitrary! Jason insisted. What about jealousy? Sarah opened the door as Jason was struggling to put on his shirt. Jonathan was standing there and she grabbed his head, gave him a long faux-passionate kiss, and then closed the door again in his face. Did that make you jealous, sweety? she asked Jason, a tad mockingly he thought. Oh, Im sorry, honey, she said, making out with him and sliding a hand down his pants. Ohhh, he said. Well now Im suddenly very jealous, he said smiling. She pinched him and ground him against the wall a bit before going to get the door. Well, when you get over it, you know where to find me, she said, pulling Jonathan inside. Uh, whos that? Jonathan asked, pointing to Jason. Oh, he was just going, she said, before dragging Jonathan into the bedroom.
 
Jason tried to get back to work, to figure out the secret code that allowed one to take over the NNA algorithm, but he just couldnt focus. Every time he tried to sit down to do the math, he felt tired or bored or distracted. All he could think about was Sarah. And all he could think about that was how anathema to productivity it was.
 
But there wasnt much he could do. He couldnt get Sarah out of his mind. And even if he could, there she was, just across the office, smiling as if nothing was wrong, and forcing her way back into his consciousness. So the next night he went back there. Sarah started first.
 
Oh, Jason, Im so sorry. I was incredibly rude. I just got so swept up in the moment, you know? Oh, thats OK. Im sorry I wasnt more understanding of your, um, lifestyle. But now? I think I can accept it. Oh, Jason, she said, hugging him, Im so glad. I really do like you. And Jon? Well, I guess I like him too. Are you OK with that? Yeah, I think so. Anything I can do to make it worth your while? she asked before kissing him, starting with his lips and then working her way down his chest.
 
Jason had heard people say that getting laid made them more productive, but he always found it a colossal waste of time. Not only the time wasted with your partner, but also all the time you spent during the day thinking about the time youd wasted or the time you would waste in the future. It made it hard to focus, worst of all now, when something important was at stake.
 
He put all thoughts of Sarah out ofSarah and Jonathan, sitting there, his musclanyway, he put all of that out of his mind and focused on the problem at hand. How did this sequence of bookmarks lead to that particular recommendation?
 
After much procrastination, he cracked the code. There were a series of accounts, call them dummy0 thru dummy15, and a series of pages, call them page0 thru page15. dummy0 linked to page0, dummy1 linked to page0 and page1, dummy2 linked to page0, page1, and page2, and so on. Then dummy15 also linked to an additional page and that was the one that got pushed out in all the recommendations.
 
Jason figured that the clustering algorithm must have discovered this cluster, noticed the odd behavior, and taken it aside for special processing. Not that anyone could know for sure without untangling all that code.
 
Days before, Jason Blakeslee, Googles head of public relations, and received a visit from Samuel Turnbill, Googles head of evangelism. The meeting was coordinated over Google Email, it was marked in Google Calendars, it was recorded by Google Video, and held on the Google campus. In that, it was like many other meetings. And yet, somehow, it was very different.
 
Im sure youll recall NNA, Samuel began, getting down to business. Of course, Blakeslee said. Well, it appears someone found a piece of it that we were hoping to keep hidden. Jesus, Sam, would it kill you to speak clearly? Im head of public relations, not the public. OK, OK. So heres how it is: theres a special control system in NNA that allows us to exercise some influence over the workings of the algorithm, for administrative purposes and that sort of thing. Someone else appears to have discovered the control structure. If this gets out, it could be incredibly damaging. It must be stopped. I understand, Blakeslee explained. Ill put our team on it. Thank you, Samuel said handing Blakeslee a USB thumb drive. Heres a quick explanation and all the relevant logs.
 
And thus the head of evangelism handed the drive to the head of public relations who handed it to head of sensitive operations who handed it to his tech lead who handed it to Mike. Piece of cake, Mike said.
 
The logs showed the IP address and time the perp had contacted Googles servers with his bookmark request. The IP address was a cable modem used mainly by one man: a Mr. Jason Barsto. Barsto had a Google account, which allowed Mike to pull up a pretty decent summary of his entire life: his email, his calendar, his search history, what news stories he liked, where he lived, surveillance photos of his house, the top people he chatted with, and on and on.
 
Now came the fun part: compiling a dossier. Mike skimmed through Barstos life, with the aid of Google technology that helped highlight key concepts and messages, getting inside Barstos head and trying to understand who he was.
 
He started with search. Barsto was a geek, the kind of person who searched Google every time a thought passed through his head. Within minutes, he knew everything from what kind of error messages Barstos computer was showing that day to what kind of porn he enjoyed. it was like a raw feed into his stream-of-consciousness.
 
Just in the past few hours Barsto had searched for:
 
Next came email. Using Google technology developed for targetting ads and improving search, his system pulled out the key concepts and emails in Barstos mailbox. Pretty quickly he learned who Barstos friends are, who his crushes were, who his boss was, and what he did with his free time. Using his Google Chat logs, he found what Barsto liked to gossip about and what crazy links he shared with his friends. (Luckily for Mike, Barsto appeared to be the kind of startup geek who never saw a Google app he didnt use.)
 
Using the calendar, he discovered when Barsto went to the gym, when he went to see his girlfriend, and so on. Connecting this with the Google friend-tracking app Barsto had installed on his GPS-enabled phone, Barsto was able to get solid GPS coordinates for all of these places on a Google Map as well as see where Barsto was right now. They could probably ask his phone to record all of his phone calls for them, although Barsto didnt have that kind of clearance.
 
Since Barsto used Google News and YouTube, he got a fairly good sense of what kinds of things Barsto was interested in and, thanks to Google Checkout, he was able to see all the recent purchases Barsto had made. But  and here was the motherload  Barsto ran Google Desktop Search, which allowed Mike to access any file on Barstos computer. He quickly pulled up Barstos full browsing history and got to see what kind of porn he liked, what blogs he visited, what he was reading about today, which non-Google apps he used, etc. (For people who didnt have Google Desktop Search installed, he got the same data thru Google Web Accelerator.)
 
By the end of the day he felt he knew Barsto better than he knew some of his own best friends. He put the highlights of what hed learned into a report for his superiors: Barstos name and address, his occupation and skill-level, his interests and hobbies, his friends and girlfriends, and (his favorite part) a series of embarrassing or otherwise fun facts that could be used for blackmail or simply amusement. (You wouldnt believe how many people kept naked photos of themselves or loved ones on their hard drives!)
 
He sent the report to his superior and wandered off for a bit to dwell on the power he had as a faceless person deep inside an office park in Mountain View to know every detail of another persons life; a person living just miles north in San Francisco. He wondered what it would be like if he came across him on the street  here, he would know every detail of Barstos life, from the secrets he confided over IM with his friends to what he looked like naked, while Barsto would see Mike as just another random face in the crowd.
 
Mike loved his job.

Im really enjoying the series of stories youre writing. Time to time its a bit paranoid, but most of us are this way, so its really interesting read. I have one thing to note though - in my opinion the name Barsto was overused in this article. I mean my teachers always told me when I was writing some peace to find synonyms for naming stuff and dont get to repetitive.

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 7
 
On his way into the office, Trent saw a pretty young girl and decided to use it as an opportunity to improve his marketing skills. Hello there, he shouted at a small and slender woman wearing a huge black coat. She didnt say anything so he ran to catch up with her. Hello there, he shouted again, this time louder and closer to his face. Umm, hello, she mumbled and tried to hurry past. Whats your name? he shouted. Mm, Jessica, she mumbled. Hello there, Jessica, he shouted. My names Trent and I have a very exciting service I want to tell you about. I think it will revolutionize the way you look at the news industry today. Its called Newsflip and They had come to the end of the block and Jessica had decided to dart across the street, dodging traffic. Trent decided not to follow. Crazy bitch, he muttered.
 
But shortly after he got into the office and settled into his desk, he got to watch another stunningly attractive young thing, wearing a tight blouse and tighter jeans saunter over to his desk. Trent, she said, sounding just happy enough that you couldnt honestly describe her as sounding unhappy, youve got a call from the press on line 3. Thanks Sandy, he said and watched her ass swing as she sauntered away from his desk. He picked up the phone. Newsflip, Trent speaking.
 
Hellllo, there, said an effusive voice at the other end of the line. Im calling from Digital World News Online Monthly and were writing a feature segment about todays top users of NNA. Now, obviously, I want to give Newsflip top billing, so I was hoping you had some time to answer a few questions about your site for us good folks. Why, of course, Trent said chivalrously. Anything for the press!
 
Well, my first question is how strong is your commitment to NNA? Oh, total, total. I know there have been some nasty and false rumors swirling around, but I can assure you those are untrue. We are 100% committed to standing on the strength of the NNA platform, which were committed to as well. Kind of like a man whos chained to the platform that hes chained to, if you know what I mean? Ohhh, I doooo, cooed the reporter in a voice that was less than convincing.
 
And do you have any problems or complaints with it? Have you been doing any research into improving it? Well, honestly, its such a great platform that we have our hands full just using it as it is, frankly. So you have no one working on the internals? No, but its not really necessary as its such a strong foundation for our platform.
 
I see. Well, thank you so much for your time, Mr.  Oh, Trent, just call me Trent. Well, thank you so much for your time, Trent. This has been very valuable for the article. Well, thank you. Bye! Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Um, bye. A long pause. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye! Trent hung up.
 
Nice journalist, Trent thought. He should note that down. What was her name? Hmm, he didnt think she said.
 
Sandy! he yelled out over the office. The girl in the tight blouse scurried over to his desk. Yes, sir? Im gonna take a meditation break for about fifteen minutes. Yes, sir; Ill do the usual. Thanks, Sandy. He again watched her saunter back to her desk. The ran to the small closet hed reclaimed as his meditation chamber and locked the door behind him.
 
It was Thursday, so Sarah decided to knock off work a bit early to go to her street fighting class. They met in the unfinished basement of what Sarah recognized as the old Pets.com building, but Sarah doubted few of the other participants would recognize it as such. Instead, they knew it mostly as the place where they got their noses ground into the cement and left blood stains on the wall, before stepping back and thanking their instructor politely for the demonstration.
 
Who wants to go first today? Owen, their instructor, asked. A girl in a pink jumpsuit raised her hand. Owen loved picking on the newbies. Now this move is called the jackdrill, he said, picking the jumpsuited girl up by her waist, flipping her upside-down, and grinding her head into the mat on the floor by spinning her around. After a couple seconds he righted and returned her, his voice changing to sincerely apologetic. Are you alright? Was that OK? he said, looking her over. Here, here, let me fix your hair. Oh, no, no, thank you, the girl said, a bit stunned, its fine.
 
When it was time to practice on their own, Sarah got paired up with an outrageously cute and muscular man shed been eying the whole evening. Hey there, she said, extending her arm. Im Sarah. Jonathan, he said, smiling winningly. She felt her heart melt just a little bit. Flipping Jonathan by the waist and watching the muscles on his back ripple, she became determined to ask him out at the end of the lesson.
 
She didnt need to. As he was toweling the sweat off his chest, he approached her. So Sarah, you doing anything tonight? She thought for a second. Jason wanted to talk about some weird work thing hed noticed but she could blow that off for a night. Uh, nope, she answered. Why dont I take you out to dinner? he asked. Sure, thatd be great, she said, smiling.
 
At dinner, she discovered that Jonathan shared her interests. In fact, he also appeared to share her friends interests as well as various other random interests she could think of. On just about any subject he could marshall a stream of facts, with names and dates and places, capped off by a touching personal anecdote or a joke.
 
Erlang: Isnt Erlang fantastic? I just love the way that message-passing unifies both the internal control structure and the intra-process communication. That said, the syntax could use some work I remember one time I showed this Erlang program to a friend and they thought it was Perl!
 
Guitar: Oh, I just think the guitar is a beautiful instrument. I love the way you get lost in the sound when youre playing a Robert Plant solo. I remember one time when I got lost in the sound and didnt find my way out for weeks!
 
Slovenian philosophy: I just cant get enough of iek! I mean, I know a lot of people think using a Lacanian model to question notions of false consciousness runs afoul of modern Popperian scientific sensibility, but at the very least now that the Bayesians have taken up arms against the Popperites theyll be willing to admit theres at least some analytical heft to the Lacanian techniques. God, youre great. I remember this one time when I told a friend that and they just looked at me.
 
Sarah accidentally dropped her napkin on the floor and Jonathan ran over to pick it up for her and she watched his muscles ripple beneath his clothes and fantasized about tearing them off. Hey, my place is just down the street a little. Want to come back for a bit? So they walked, chatting happily, through the Mission and she let him into her apartment and they chatted some more on the couch for a bit, finding odd excuses to move a bit closer to each other and look into each others eyes until Sarah reached out for the kiss and Jonathan followed and pushed her down onto the couch, making out for a while before he began lifting off her shirt.
 
Wayne spent the first load of cash on a fancy new office, the best to give the right impression about the Wayne Darnus Center for User Priorities, of course. Then he hired an attractive assistant for the same reason (and to help him with his soon-to-be-busy schedule).
 
Whats the first order of business? he asked her, once he was settled in his plush new chair behind is imposing new desk. Uh, we dont have any orders of business, she said. OK, well then the first order of business is to think of one.
 
Whats the first order of business? he asked her. To think of a first order of business, she said. Alright, Ill do that and get back to you.
 
Although technically, he added, it will be a second order of business since thinking of it already was the first order of business. Good point, she said, and scurried off.
 
Jason spent the day thinking about the other afternoon he spent with Sarah. Hed come over to work but working led to chatting and chatting led to moving closer and pretty soon the only productive thing he got out of the day was exercise. As soon as he was done with what he was working on that day, he biked as fast as he could to Sarahs house and knocked on the door. Hey there, he said smiling as she opened it. She didnt smile back; she just grabbed him and threw him against the wall, closing the door behind her with her foot. She grabbed his head and pushed it into the wall with her mouth, as he made pleasant-sounding noises. By the time they got into the bathroom, he was only half-clothed.
 
Then there was a knock on the door and they pulled away. Who the fuck is that? Jason asked. Sarah looked at the clock on her dresser. Oh, shoot, Im sorry. Thats probably Jonathan. Jason looked at her for a while, puzzled. She looked back for what seemed like a long moment and then said Oh, you do know Im poly, right?

Dear Bubble City fans: Im sorry for the delay. I got sick and couldnt write. Im going to try to catch up today; well see how far I get.
 
Also, Ive changed Dianes name to Sarah. It just seemed to fit better (although now Im having second thoughts). Ill try to change names around less than Cory Doctorow, but I hope youll forgive one or two. Also, Ive fixed this and some other mistakes in previous entries.

Title: Cooling the Mark Out
 
You run into a man at a party. You strike up a conversation. He seems
very friendly. You like him. And then he tells you about some friends he
has. This man is called the roper.
 
The friends tell you about a deal. They know about a gamble, but its
rigged so you cant lose. Just give them some money and theyll show
you. This is called the con.
 
The first time you give them money it works; it comes back ten-fold. But
now youre getting greedy. You want to do it again, bigger this time.
Only this time their money doesnt come back. This is called the loss.
 
You feel like a chump. Your greediness got the best of you. You want to
get back at those con-men. You are called the mark.
 
But the roper talks you down.  You cant go to the police without
admitting that you were trying to commit a crime. And everybody has to
lose sometime, right? It could be worse. This is called cooling out the
mark.
 
Erving Goffman, the great sociologist, noticed this decades ago. Only he
didnt just notice it in con men. Students had to be persuaded to accept
a world far less idealistic than they learned in school.  Kids who
failed the bar exam had to persuade themselves they didnt really want
to be lawyers. People at restaurants had to be persuaded to accept the
screwup by the kitchen. Everyone occasionally needs schooling in the
philosophy of taking a loss.
 
It was this last example that particularly struck me. The other day,  I
was watching a video clip of a motivational speaker. And what did he
talk about? A screwup by a restaurant he went to. And how the host
worked hard, overhard even, to pacify him about it.
 
It was a decent story. It was very well told. But why was a motivational
speaker telling it? But now I realize: it was about cooling out the
mark.
 
Cooling out marks is how institutions persuade people to accept things
they think are wrong. The con-man convinces you getting stolen from is
OK. Your job convinces you its OK that theyre corrupt. The restaurant
persuades you its OK that theyre incompetent.
 
Motivational speakers do the same thing. Did the economy cheat you,
fire you, stick you in some crappy job with a crabby boss? Listen, the
motivational speaker explains, its not the economys fault. And just as
the roper is always separate from the con men, the motivational speaker
doesnt directly work for the economy. He sits on the sidelines, waiting
to cool the mark out.

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 6
 
Miller ushered him into a clean, but ancient, little house with leather sofas and bright windows. Take a seat, he said. Can I get you anything? Uh, no thanks, Jason said, a bit surprised at this reception. OK, Im gonna fix myself a drink, Miller said, heading into the kitchen.
 
You know, he said in between noises of liquids mixing and ice crunching, I always knew someday someone would call me to account. Im actually kind of surprised it took so long. He returned and grabbed a chair across from Jason. Alright, so lets do this: I think you have something you want to ask me.
 
Caught a bit off-guard by all the franknessand the prescienceJason began by stuttering. Well, uh, I was looking through the NNA code and, as Im sure you know, well, I mean obviously you know, theres this section in there thats just a series of numbers. S-boxes, you might call them. Miller laughed. Anyway, it appears to me that the S-boxes only affect the results under fairly unusual circumstances  that they seem to be a kind of backdoor allowing someone to remotely control the output of NNA.
 
So you havent found the key yet? No, not yet. That code is impenetrable! Miller laughed. I was hoping you might be able to shed some light. Come on, now. Im sure youre nice, but Im not about to give out the backdoor to NNA to any pretty young thing that happens to come out here and knock on my door. Anyway, even if I wanted to, I couldnt. Yahoo insisted on wiping all my drives after I left the company. I dont have the key anymore.
 
But surely you can reconstruct it? I mean, the code is open source  you can see the backdoor right there. Yes, but it was a sort of public key-style system. Whats in the code is just the public part; anyone can read that. But it was generated from the private key  the series of patterns that will trigger it. Basically, what you see in those S-boxes is just the hash of the private key and it only kicks in if the hash of a voting cluster matches.
 
So whyd you do it? For fun? Of course not. I knew it was wrong. I wasnt gonna pull another Dennis Ritchie. I was ordered to. The folks at Yahoo insisted that if we were going to open source this engine they had to have a way of clearing out illegal and offensive stories; otherwise itd tarnish their good name. Of course, that department disappeared in a reorg shortly after the softwares release and I disappeared along with it, so I suppose its all kind of irrelevant now, except as a historical curiosity.
 
Historical curiosity? Jason shouted, before realizing how loud he was being. Its a major security vulnerability in a key piece of infrastructure! Do you have any idea how bad this is? Yeah, yeah, I suppose technically it is, Miller said, but lets be realistic here. My copy of the key was wiped, everyone at Yahoo who knew about the project is long gone, and there werent many of them to begin with. Its a dead letter.
 
You dont understand, Jason said. Someones using it. I dont know whether they were at Yahoo or whether they got it from someone or whether they figured it out, but its getting used. There are anomalies in the recommendations that just cant be explained any other way. Oh god. What are they doing with it? Well, its difficult to tell without cracking the key. The big piece Ive been able to spot so far is that theyre getting inane videos recommended to everyone. But who knows what else theyre doing.
 
Well, you do. Just change the S-boxes and see what recommendations change. Ah, youre right! I just need to feed it the live input! If I give that to two versions with no randomness and different S-boxes, the difference will have to be exactly the orders from the backdoor. And oh god, and thatll tell me what the key is: I just remove all the pieces of the input that dont affect the difference and whatevers left must be what triggers the backdoor. Thats brilliant! I just need to get my hands on a copy of the live database and some computers. Wow, thanks so much. Glad to help.
 
So youll come forward? Tell the world about the security hole you put in so we can force people to take it out? Miller laughed. Not a chance. But I thought you said  you said you were against it. I am, but look around. See this house? This couch? This cozy little place in the woods. I got to retire early on my Yahoo stock options. And I got those by signing some pretty iron-clad non-disclosure agreements. I talk about any of this in public and I spend the rest of my life in court, watching all of this get taken away. Sorry, kid, but youre on your own on this one.
 
But, but, Jason said. Dont you see how important this is? The integrity of the worlds news is at stake! And you seem like just the one to save it, Miller said. In fact, it seems like you already have your solution all figured out. All I can really say is best of luck to you.
 
But, but, Jason said, exasperated. Well, the very least you can do is walk me through the code. Miller just laughed. That codes gotten so crusty since the last time I touched it. I dont think theres a person on Earth who really understands it anymore. I guess thats why no one else has caught the S-boxes. Everyone knows better than to go near that thing.
 
Anyway, unless you have anything else, Ive got a game of Starcraft that I really should be getting back to, Miller said. Uh, I guess not. Thanks for talking to me about it, I guess. Oh, of course. Sorry I couldnt be more help. But good luck, kid. Youll need it. And with that Miller showed him the door. And Jason found himself standing alone in the middle of a hillside, wondering how a kid like him was going to save the news.
 
When he got back, he quietly made a dump of the Newsflip database and rejiggered his program to try to dissect the live DB instead of generating random ones. He quickly saw much better results. Within hours it had pared things down to just a couple hundred thousand possibilities.
 
While he was waiting, he pored over the diffs hed generated as Miller had suggested: the changes that the backdoor had made to peoples recommendations. The first thing he noticed was that just about everyone was seeing crummy stories: the video of the dog peeing, news about dumb celebrities, that sort of thing. Meanwhile, real news  like the attack on Iran  was completely buried. Only a small handful ever saw it.
 
Jason was shocked. The American people werent being dumb  obsessed with celebrity over politics, with bodily fluids over intellectualism. Thats just what they were being fed. And there was someone out there making sure of that.
 
Jason was bubbling mad  and his anger only increased as he watched the elements tick away on his little script to search for the backdoor  each tick making his blood boil higher. And as it was almost done, the phone rang. It was Sarah.
 
Hey kiddo, she sang. Caught you playin hooky at the office? Whats up? she asked. Oh, not much, Jason lied. Just thought Id work from home today. Oh yeah, I get sick of those slobs too. Hey, want to come over to my place and keep me company? Uh, well, Jason started. Oh, dont worry. Ive got wifi and everything  you can work from here just fine. I promise I wont distract you too much.
 
Jason knew he should stay at home and finish what hed started, but a tingle of excitement ran through his body, telling him he really ought to see Sarah. OK, how about I come over there in twenty minutes? Sounds good, she said, and gave him her address. See you soon! See you, he said, and hung up.
 
By then the computer had cracked the code and he went over to see what was what. It was, as predicted, a bunch of bookmarks, but in some weird series that Jason couldnt quite follow. He tried reproducing it by creating some dummy accounts of his own, but before he could really puzzle things out he realized that hed promised Sarah hed be there ten minutes ago and dropped what he was working on to run for the door.
 
Deep inside the Googleplex, behind a set of keycard-locked doors, behind another set that required keys for entry, behind another set that clearly read NO VISITORS BEYOND THIS POINT, lay a series of employees that, except for the slightly-heightened security, seemed like all the others.
 
Tom was going through his daily rounds of checking on the recommender results when he noticed a certain story was being recommended to him twice. The recommender was programmed to only recommend the same story to someone only once, so that never happened  unless one of his teammates screwed up. Hey Kevin, get over here. You fucked up again. A miffed-looking British fellow headed over to Toms desk. What are you talking about?
 
You fucked up  Im seeing this dog story getting recommended twice. But how can that be? Kevin asked. I put in safeguards to make sure that never happened again. Unreal. Are you sure its not on your end? Of course its not on my end  Im looking at the raw recommendation output. Alright, alright, well trace it back. See which posts are conflicting. OK, give me a second. Here, grab a chair.
 
Whoa, this is weird, Tom said. I dont recognize any of these accounts. Do you? Numbered account names? Wed never be so blatant. Fuck. You know what this means, right? We have an incompetent intern? No, moron, it means someones onto us. Theyve figured out the back door and theyre testing it for themselves. Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit. What do we do? What can we do? We gotta talk to Saul.
 
They headed over to a slightly larger cubicle hidden in a corner. Saul, weve got a situation here. Situation? Saul asked. What is this? Some kind of spy movie? Whatre you talking about? Someone else has found the backdoor. We spotted a bunch of bookmarks in the same pattern as were using from a different set of accounts. Fuck. OK, well, thanks for telling me.
 
Heres what I want you to do. Youre going to walk calmly back to your desks. Youre going to write up everything youve learned so far and place it on this Flash drive. He removed a small USB keyfob from inside his desk. Youre then going to give me the keyfob, wipe everything related from your machines, and pretend this never ever happened, you understand? This is out of your hands now. Im going to make sure this gets taken care of. Tom and Kevins eyes widened. Wait, Tom said, you dont mean Exactly, Saul replied. This is a job for public relations.

Title: GPhone Announced, Morons
 
Several years ago, the key members of the team at Danger, then the leading phone OS development firm (they made the Hiptop, called the Sidekick in the US), left to start a new company called Android, which was shortly thereafter acquired by Google. The folks at Android were not shy at what they were up to. One founder, who was in Boston at the same time I was, stated it clearly: they were creating an open OS for phones. When asked what the point of this was, he suddenly got very vague.
 
A couple years later Apple released the iPhone and what was now a Google division started rounding up partners for the Android OS. The press got wind of it and went crazy. Google was making a phone  a GPhone! How could Apple compete? What fancy gadgets did it have? Would Google take control of the cell phone industry too?
 
And today, Google announced what they were doing: the same thing they were always doing, the same thing Android had been doing since day one. Theyre making an open OS for phones.
 
The only announcement today is of their new Open Handset Alliance, which I cant help but feel is a jab at the Open Content Alliance (which Google pointedly refuses to join). Google has certainly put their clout behind the team at Android and gotten an impressive number of people to sign up to support their little OS. But lets not let the press buzz get out of hand. Google isnt coming out with a phone, theyre releasing an open phone operating system. When asked what the point of this is, they suddenly get very vague. Just like always.
 
I certainly cant imagine that having an open phone OS is a bad thing and Im glad such talented people are working on it and I hope its good and gets widely adopted, so I can get an even nicer Sidekick cheaply. But, jeez people, lets not blow this out of proportion. Its just a bunch of open source software.

Its more vaporware than OSS, and is being promoted with statements like Because these innovations and differentiated features can be kept proprietary, manufacturers and mobile operators are protected from the viral infection problem often associated with other licenses.
 
Plus, OpenMoko hardware actually exists, was available for developers months ago and will ship by the end of the year.

Yes, but I dont think anyone predicted that in advance. When Linus Torvalds announced the first release, geeks liked it but it didnt get tabloid-style coverage. It took decades of hard work to make it into something generally useful. The same could be true of Android; declaring victory today is premature.

Actually, the Open Handset Alliance sounds like the Open Mobile Alliance.
 
Although the Android OS might create emulation on the mobile market, I dont like the idea that Google is the center of this movement.
 
They bring great developers, their trademark and their logo, but they are also outsourcing the development of applications while potentially getting the ads revenue.
 
Moreover, this move continues to fragment the Mobile Linux development as this post discusses.
 
Perhaps Android will create an interesting ecosystem and I hope there will a fork with no trace of Google ; otherwise, Ill prefer Maemo or ideally Ubuntu Mobile with a Nokia device.

First, I dont understand who you are calling morons in the title and why you think thats useful here.
 
Second, I dont understand why just because Google announced that they are building an OS, everyone assumes that this means that they are not also planning on building a phone.

Im not sure how you can compare Linux and Android. When Linus announced the first release, it was being developed solely by a Finnish university student as a hobby. Android is supported by a $200 billion corporation.

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 5
 
Stare. Stare. Tick. Tick. Ancient art hung on the walls. Ancient books
lined the shelves. The light fixtures looked like they hadnt been
dusted since Carter urged Americans to save electricity. So, how are
things at the new offices? a wisened-looking old man sitting at the
other end of the table asked. Oh, fine, Grandpa, Jason replied.
What is it you guys do again? Videos of models doing backflips?
No, Jason said with a sigh. Were a news site. You mean like the
New York Times? Kind of, except we dont write the news, we just try
to find bits of it for you. How do you do that? Well, we look at
everything people on the Internet are reading and talking about and
then we try to pick out which of those people are most like you and
tell you about the stories they like at the moment. I see, the old
man said. I see.
 
So how well does it work? Well, uh, not so great, actually. Thats
what Ive been investigating lately. What do you mean? Well, it
seems like the site is recommending everyone the same inane stuff,
like stupid videos and that sort of thing. Ah, yes. Well, hate to
say I told you so, but this is just like that article i was reading
inwhat was it? Foreign Affairs?predicted. What do you mean?
It said that in the future wed have this personal newspaper all you
tech wizards have been promising us, only itd recommend us the same
stupid crap (pardon my language) that average people have been
enjoying for centuries.
 
Really? Jason asked, suspicious. Do you happen to have the
article? Oh yes, its right over the old man stood up to get it
but then remembered he had broken his knee, the ostensible reason for
Jasons visit, and thought better of it. Its right over therecould
you fetch it for me? Oh, of course, Jason said. He pulled it down
and flipped through it.
 
It was by the former editor of the New York Times and made the usual
viritolic case for trusting human editors over some algorithm based on
the whims of random people. And somehow it found a way to compare news
recommenders to street vomit, which Jason had to admit was a
depressingly common sight in San Francisco. Jason briefly wondered if
the old media was using the backdoor to prop up their dying business
models, but quickly decided nobody at those companies was clued-in
enough to know what a backdoor was.
 
Yes, yes, Ive heard all this, Grandfather, but I just dont buy it.
Oh, whats your explanation? Just need to improve the technology, eh?
Because Ive heard that one more than a few times. No, I think
someone is trying to manipulate the results. What? Oh, god, you
young people are always jumping to conspiracy theories. Why cant you
just admit your precious little system doesnt work? Why do you have
to create some shadowy cabal of people trying to control the news.
Jason just sighed. Lets talk about something else.
 
Whats your shirt say? Daring Fireball? Whats that?
 
Wayne quickly found that, although Google didnt want their name on
the check or the web site, they were most accommodating in other
matters. They gave him a nice little office inside the Googleplex, let
him play with all the fancy equipment and company perks (free laundry,
free swimming pool, free video games), and had a stream of people
coming by to chat him up and suggest new ideas for promoting NNA.
 
He was a bit wary of getting so close to someone he had so often
railed against, but he thought that perhaps this was his reward for
his ceaseless railing. Anyway, there were a lot of other evils out
there to fight, and if working with Google made him more effective at
fighting those, wasnt it, on balance, a good thing? And the free food
was nice too.
 
On the plane back, Jason tried to figure out the meaning of the
S-boxes. He spent the first couple hours tracing the code, trying to
understand how it worked and how the S-boxes were used, before finally
giving up in frustration. It was just too complicated.
 
So, being a programmer, he decided to try a more automated approach.
First, he took NNA and replaced its random number generating system
with a function that always returned the number 17 (17 was a pretty
random number, right?). Then he made a copy in which the only thing he
changed was the S-boxes. He then wrote a program to generate random
input files for the recommender. It fed the same file to both
recommenders  the normal one and the one with the modified S-boxes
 and it looked at the output to see if there were any differences.
Since hed taken all the randomness out of the algorithm, any
difference in output had to be due to the one thing that had changed:
the S-boxes. In other words, the program would search for inputs that
triggered the S-boxes.
 
There was just one problem: there were a lot of possible inputs. For
the rest of the plane ride, his program tried thousands and thousands
of inputs, but none of them showed any difference. When the plane
landed, he slipped his laptop in his bag and let it keep crunching,
but he knew hed have to try a different tack.
 
Wayne Darnus told everyone who would listen that he had invented NNA,
but as far as Jason could tell, he was using invented in the most
loosest of senses. Digging back through the changelog on the NNA
source code, which was provided for free to all from a project on
SourceForge, he found the code was originally written by some
programmer at Yahoo, back when Yahoo had real programmers. Getting a
name was near impossible  Yahoo had apparently insisted that all its
programmers contribute under the name A Yahoo! Some boneheaded
corporate consistency policy, no doubt.
 
But the author must have given up his identity somewhere. Then it
hit him: mailing lists. No programmer worth their salt could give up a
good mailing list flamewar. Whoever wrote NNA must have shown up on a
mailing list once or twice to defend it. Finding him would be easy:
all Jason had to do was read through ten or twenty thousand messages
arguing about the minutiae of NNAs design principles.
 
After trawling through interminable debates in mailing list archives,
for what felt like days, Jason finally found a post from a man whos
patronizingly knowledgeable tone unmistakably indicated that he was the
one who wrote it all. And the message was posted from home, so his
computer had no qualms about signing his name. There it was in black
and white, the man who had started it all: Dan Miller.
 
Dan Miller was a rather elusive party. He had no website or home page
and despite NNAs incredible popularity, hed apparently never been
interviewed by the press. (Wayne had been interviewed endlessly, of
course. Whenever someone neglected to include him in their
history books, he complained about their lack of commitment to
historical accuracy on his vlogcast.) Jason wasnt too surprised,
though. Finding MIller hadnt been easy, and he hadnt known many
journalists who were willing to do much work to get a technology
story.
 
Millers entry in the Yahoo corporate directory had long since gone
stale  hed left years ago  and emails to his personal account
bounced with the message Mailbox full.  overflowing with spam,
presumably.
 
He just couldnt get a handle on this guy. So he called Eric. Oh,
yeah, Miller. Wow, theres a name I hadnt heard in a long time. So
you think he might be your source into cracking this NNA thing?
Seems like its worth a shot, Jason replied. Yeah, I suppose it
does. Alright, then, well, I guess Ill look this up for you. What are
we searching for? OK, here we go: Daniel Miller, last known employer
Yahoo. Uhhh, OK, he lives in Mill Valley, Ill email you his address.
Wow, Eric, thats incredible. Thanks so much. No trouble; its
always nice to have an excuse to use these skills.
 
Marin County wasnt exactly known for its comprehensive public
transport system, so Jason hopped a cab, which deposited him someplace
random in the middle of a hillside. He climbed around for a while
looking for the house he knew must be nestled in it somewhere, before
finally locating the place. He navigated his way to the entrance, then
knocked politely on the door.
 
He wondered how a software developer could live in a place like this
 isolated from the rest of the Valley, away from the buzz and
excitement of the industry. But then again, he wondered how a software
developer could live without having a website. Maybe Miller wasnt
much of a software developer.
 
A man in a beard who looked to be about in his late fifties answered the
door. Hello? he said, apparently unaccustomed to receiving visitors.
Dan Miller? Yup. Hey there, I was looking into NNAs source code
and I have a few questions. I know you probably hate to be bugged
about software you wrote over a decade ago, but I came all the way out
here and Id really appreciate just a bit of your time to answer just
a question or two about NNA.
 
Miller smiled knowingly and gave Jason a long, piercing gaze. ah,
yes, he said at last. Ive been expecting you.

Great story so far, but you seem to be lacking restraint in teasing your readers. The pace of the story has really picked up as compared to the beginning. Not that I mind ;~)

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 4
 
Hows it going, kiddo? Theyd already gotten to kiddo? Jason tried to blend in with his chair. Helllo, kiddo? You in there? Trent slapped him on the back of the head. Jason felt a sharp pain and decided to give up on the ruse. Uh, yes, sir. Or at least I have been for the past couple decades. Ahh, a kidder. Love that.
 
Anyway, just wanted to check in, see how you were doing, all that good boss stuff, you know? Ah, of course, sir. Everythings going great. The, uh, other team membershe looked at Sarahhave been really helpful and, uh, yeah, just everything is going really well, I guess. Glad to hear it, Trent said.
 
You know, Trent said, before pausing a moment to look around Jasons desk, uh, Jason, that Newsflip isnt just another one of those startups out to make a quick buck. We have a noble mission. For decades, people have gotten their news from a handful of conglomerates whove bought each other up so many times that they cant tell their CEO from their HR department. And news is important. Without the news, you wouldnt have any idea who won the latest sports game or why were invading Iran. Were invading Iran again? Jason asked. Anyway, I just want you to know that this is a company that makes a difference. I see, so were a company thats out for a quick buck while thinking were helping the world. Exactly, Trent said. Anyway, Ive got another dozen meetings, so I better head off, but just give me a ring if you need me. Of course, Jason said.
 
Jason went back to his screen and decided to actually read through Newsflip to see this great new democratizing force, telling people about the reasons we were invading Iran. The top 5? Waking Up During Surgery, Its Official: Tom Cruise Has Sucked the Life out of Katie Holmes, Excited Pug Pees on Cameraman, 5 Stupid Things You Said to Her, and Can Medical Marijuana Cost You Your Kid? Jason sighed.
 
Jason thought of himself as a rather sophisticated person, but
Newsflips recommender certainly didnt seem to think so. He wondered
how many other people got the same sort of treatment. So he opened up
a raw connection to the database and did a query. Tens of thousands of
people were seeing the story about dogs peeing. Odd, he thought.
 
He needed someone to bounce things off of, so he called the best
person he knew for that sort of thing: Eric. Eric was brilliant. In
the first bubble, hed made millions as a teenager whod managed to
persuade some VCs to let him run a web news company. But the
experience had burned him out badly and now he mostly slunk around his
apartment in San Francisco and watched TV. Still, he knew this stuff
better than anyone. Jason gave him a call.
 
Hey, Eric, you got a moment? Yeah, not like Im doing anything
else. You ever read Newsflip? Look, Jason, I love you and all, but
Im not going to start using some website just because you work there.
The news is a complete waste of ti Yeah, yeah, I know. I read your
blog, dude. Really? I didnt think anyone did. Oh, geez, youre
the topanyway, can you just go there for a minute and point it at
your del.icio.us page to generate some recommendations. Yeah, uh,
OK. Jason heard some sounds of typing and sighing thru the phone.
Alright, here we go: 25 stories. Yeah, this stuff is total crap. Dogs
peeing on people and that sort of thing.
 
OK, now Jason was suspicious. Eric was just about the last person on
Earth who ought to be recommended that story. God, Jason. What do you
train this thing with? Its terrible. What the hell algorithm is it
running anyway? Thats what Im trying to figure out. Mind if I
swing by your place? Not really; you might, though. See you in
fifteen.
 
Jason packed up his laptop, ran down the stairs, and biked over to
Erics apartment in the Western Addition. Eric answered the door
almost before Jason had knocked. Inside was a den of total filth:
clothes strewn everywhere, pizza boxes piled high, no outside light
coming in, and little inside light turned on. Jason hugged the wall to
make sure he didnt run into anything. Take a seat on the couch,
Eric said, gesturing to a pile of crap in the corner. Jason tried to
dig through it to clear a space big enough for his butt.
 
OK, so Ive got the code on here that generates this stuff. Mind
looking thru it on here with me? Yeah, why not? Eric said, clearing
off a similar space for himself. Maybe its a bug in the renderer;
its rendering the same recommendations for everyone. Nah, cant be
 the recommendations are actually in the database. Theyre
definitely getting spit out by the recommender.
 
Well, is the recommender just generating the same stuff for
everyone? Nah, cant be. People would have noticed that. People
are more alike than youd expect. Check. So Jason ran a few queries
to see. Nope, theres definitely variance in what people are getting
recommended.
 
Hmm, Eric said. Well, maybe the recommender youre using just
sucks. No way, Jason said. Were using NNA. Its state of the art.
All the big guys use it  Google News, Yahoo, even the new NYTimes
redesign. Eric laughed. State of the art? That piece of cruft hasnt
been touched since the Bad Old Days. Isnt there some new thing
everyone is switching to? I dont know; you obviously follow this
stuff more than I do.
 
So why dont you just upgrade it to the new stuff. Yeah, I guess
thats a good idea. Ill talk to the guys, he said. Oh wait  I
just remembered. We tried that and Wayne Darnis threw this total
shitstorm. You should have seen the place  it was crazy. No way
theyre doing that again.
 
Well, lets open up NNA and take a look at it, Eric suggested. Im
sure its a morass, but I cant think of anything else to do. Fine,
said Jason, pulling it up. Eric was right. They scrolled through it,
but couldnt make heads or tails of it. Things had been patched and
repatched so many times that it might as well have been written in
INTERCAL. But Jason scrolled thru it as best he can, trying to see if
he could see something.
 
Wait! Eric shouted. Go back. What the hell is that? Eric pointed
to a block of numbers on the screen, sticking out from the rest of the
program like a sore thumb. I dunno, I assumed it was just some
constants, Jason said defensively. Who the hell has a page of
one-byte constants in the middle of their program?
 
Eric looked closer. Oh my god, these arent constants. These are
S-boxes! Huh? Jason said. S-boxes! You never heard about those?
No, Jason said, again annoyed at Erics habit of assuming everyone
had his encyclopedic knowledge for odd details. Back in the bad old
days of encryption, IBM or someone came up with this algorithm called
DES  Data Encryption Standard.
 
NIST, the government standards body, ratified it and it went on to be
the standard encryption algorithm used in banks and computers and all
that stuff. But right before the government ratified it, they sent it
to the NSA  you know, the spy organization that hires up all the top
math students to break encryption algorithms so they can better tap
everyones phones  for final approval.
 
The NSA said they liked it but they just had one little change. And
they fiddled with these things called the S-boxes  big lists of
numbers that your message was run through as it was encrypted. The NSA
claimed they just were helping make sure the S-boxes were as secure as
possible, but they never explained how or why they picked the numbers
they did. So, although its never been proven, a lot of people assume
the S-boxes are the NSAs backdoor into the private conversations of
DES users  that theres something about the S-boxes that makes it
easy for them to decrypt peoples messages.
 
What are you saying, Eric? That someone put a backdoor into NNA?
Hey, Im not saying anything. I mean, Im sure there were perfectly
good reasons that DES needed S-boxes; its just that the NSA got to
choose them that was suspicious. Maybe the same thing is true with
NNA; maybe theres some good reason it needs S-boxes, although nothing
springs to mind.
 
But how would a backdoor in this program even work? It doesnt talk
to the network; it just gets stories in and pushes recommendations
out. Am I supposed to believe that buried within these numbers are
some secret rules to always elevate stories about dogs peeing?
 
No, of course not, Eric said. Think about it: its the perfect
system. The recommender doesnt talk to the network itself, of course,
but it gets fed tons of data from crawlers which, all the time, are
scouring the Net for various pages and dumping some facts about them
into the recommender. The recommender could just keep an eye out for
page patterns which match the S-boxes and use those as its
instructions.
 
God, youre right! Thats brilliant. And it would be almost
impossible to trace, because any one of a million pages on the Web
could have set it off. Precisely, Eric said. So youre saying some
guy out has a series of pages that encode secret orders, telling all
the worlds news sites to feature stories about dogs peeing? No, no,
no, not at all. That would be irresponsible. Im just saying its
possible. Eric paused. Anyway, he continued, if he was smart it
wouldnt be a series of pages  thats too traceable. Hed just use
Tor or some sort of anonymizing proxy to send the messages by voting
through some dummy account on del.icio.us or something like that. Itd
be impossible to trace.
 
This is all just speculation, of course. We have no more evidence of
it than a bunch of funny numbers in a poorly-written computer
program, Eric quickly added. Yes, but its so perfectso devilishly
clever. Hey, hang on a minute. My phones ringing. Jason didnt
realize how oppressive Erics apartment was until he left the heavy
putrid air to answer the phone outside. Hello? he said. Jason, you
need to come home, said the man on the other end of the line.

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 3
 
The next day was a Saturday but by the following Monday things had calmed down and Jason could finally begin real work.
 
He began, as he always did, by trying to figure out the system. You couldnt really work on something until you really grokked it: understood all the pieces and how they interacted and why they were there. If you didnt get that, then you could spend days trying to fix one piece, only to discover all your effort was wasted because your fixes would be ineffective as long as another part was in place.
 
He first checked out a copy of the code, staring at the list of thousands of files on his screen, trying to figure out where to start. As usual, nobody had bothered to write down anything explaining things. So he began opening pieces up, finding that they referenced other sections and bouncing from section to section until the big picture became clearer.
 
By the end of the day, he felt he had a pretty solid understanding of how the whole thing worked. Not how people thought it worked, but how it actually did  what the code that actually ran the system said.
 
What the hell were they thinking? Sarah thought, as she sat staring at yet another of the braindead interfaces the programmers had come up with. She knew they had no contact with other humans but honestly sometimes she didnt understand why they couldnt even figure out basic principles of decent design.
 
She started, as she always did, by trying to figure out the system. She looked at the various pieces of the interface and tried to figure out the different concepts they were manipulating. Programmers always thought of it in terms of how the system was built, but the users had no idea how the system was built and couldnt cares.
 
You had to think of it from their perspective: what was it they wanted to do, what were the things they encountered along the way, and how could you make sure they felt like they were in control of those things?
 
And then, once you figured all that out, how did you beat it through the heads of the programmers?
 
Trents calendar warned him of an impending VC meeting. Running an office like this  servers, employees, big looming screens overhead  wasnt cheap. And since the site didnt run ads or have a revenue stream, the only way to keep the lights on was to trot back to the VCs every six months with some impressive charts and some pleas for cash.
 
He looked through the names of the people he was meeting with and then jumped over to scan their blogs. To pitch to people you really had to understand them. Figure out what made them tick. Everyone required a different pitch and Trent knew exactly how to reshape it for them, just as Newsflip reshaped a series of links to meet the readers desires.
 
He remembered what companies theyd previously invested on, which ones had done well, what theyd mentioned their kids were into, what gadgets they enjoyed, and  most importantly  how Trent had cut them favors in the past. This town ran on that sort of thing.
 
High above the Newsflip offices loomed a series of big screens with a rapidly-scrolling list of links. The lists were generated by a series of crawlers which ran, 24/7, around various weblogs and social bookmarking sites. Every time someone posted a new link to their blog, or bookmarked something on del.icio.us, or voted for it on Digg, it saw it and noted it. 
Then another program took these triples (jon, del.icio.us bookmarked, lessig.org) and scoured them for patterns. Were a group of people all bookmarking lessig.org today? Are a dozen blogs all linking to a particular YouTube video?
 
It then used these patterns to cluster users into groups. Jon, Jim, and Jill all like YouTube videos about cats. Sal, Sue, and Sam all like newspaper articles about copyright.
 
And that way, when it saw a new YouTube video about cats, or a new newspaper article about copyright, it could make a guess at who would like it. And that combination of guesses made up the Newsflip front page.
 
When you visited Newsflip for the first time, itd show you a bunch of things that were widely liked by different groups of people. Maybe the top link today about music and sports and technology and business. And when you clicked the one you liked the most  lets say music  itd show you ten more stories from the various subgroups of music. In just a couple clicks  music, pop, indie, guitar-based  itd have you figured out and know a great deal more about which kind of links to send your way.
 
From then on, every time you visited the site it would use this knowledge to send you links it thought you might like. It would also show you a few random popular links as well, just to make sure it wasnt missing out on any other odd tastes you had. So every time you visited Newsflip it served you up a couple dozen stories it thought that you would like. (Of course, it also noted down which stories you clicked on and said you liked, right along with the links and bookmarks.)
 
At the heart of it was the pattern-finding system that noticed when groups of people seemed to be doing something. It was based on a system called Notated News Analysis (NNA) which had been invented ages ago by some old guy who turned it into a public standard. Now dozens of sites, including Newsflip, used it to try to generate the best recommendations about what to see on the Internet.
 
Samuel scrolled through his notes one last time before the meeting. Soon people would be filing into the conference room and he couldnt afford to seem unprepared in front of them. He visualized himself standing in front of the room, walking through the bullet points, smoothly ordering the meeting, parrying questions, parceling out action items, dodging barbs. He was ready.
 
People filed in, pulled out their laptops, and engaged in the pre-meeting chit-chat; the final moment of levity before the meetings dreadfully boring waste of time. Finally, he tapped on the table for order.
 
Hey everyone, welcome back to the monday morning evangelism team coordination meeting. As usual, well go around the table and have each team bring us up to date on their activities. Ill start.
 
So this week I gave a keynote at OSCON and encouraged developers to use Google Platform to host their apps. My main points were: 1) that this was a new era of openness here at Google, where we were handing control of our computers to the community; 2) that we had by far the most powerful and scalable system for deployment; and 3) that we were always on the lookout for the developers of the next hot application and that users of Google Platform would be fast-tracked with the acquisition team.
 
Alright, HR?
 
So this week we did a booth at the Ubuntu conference. These things continue to be an amazing value for us. The booth costs a pittance, we managed to snag four top developers out of it (gave them the usual bullshit about the Googs commitment to open source), and we lined them up in job slots that are definitely going to take them out of the open source world for a while.
 
Great work! Standards?
 
Well, the big news continues to be NNA. Newsflip, a small startup up in San Francisco, was trying to switch away from it but, of all things, Wayne Darnus turned the firehose on them and managed to talk them out of it. So now
 
Wait, Wayne Darnus? Yup! Whats his angle? Well, you know, he says he invented NNA so anything that takes attention away from it just makes him less important. Samuel broke out laughing. Oh god, thats perfect. So what did he do? Oh, you know, the usual. Did a piece on how he was oh-so-concerned about all the poor users who would be hurt by the switch. Samuel couldnt stop giggling. Oh my god, he said. This is just too perfect. Yeah, the guys basically doing our job for us.
 
Yeah, exactly. Hey, that gives me an idea. Do you have Waynes number? His phone number? Yeah. Uh, sure, Ive got it here somewhere. OK, 510-555-2414. Samuel picked up the phone and dialed it, repeating the numbers back as he did. He made a shushing sound and set it on speakerphone.
 
Hello? came the gruff voice at the other end. Wayne! Good to hear you. Hey, this is Samuel Boxton over at Google Evangelism. Google? Hey, I didnt say anything about Google on todays show. That stuff I said wasnt targeted you at all.
 
No, no, Wayne, Im not calling to complain; Im calling to congratulate. Congratulate? Congratulate what? Congratulate you, silly. On the great job you did with Newsflip. That was a real act of generous diplomacy you did there. Oh, uh, well, I guess it was. Thanks. But why does Google care about something like that?
 
Dont be silly, Wayne. At Google were just like you  looking out for the users. Trying to make the best Web experience for everyone. Were really 100% on the same page there. Um, yeah then, I suppose we are. You know, its a shame that weve never managed to collaborate before. Our interests are so aligned that it would really be great if we could figure out some way to work together. What do you mean? Do you have some kind of joint project in mind?
 
No, not exactly, Wayne. I was thinking more some kind of funding arrangement. Funding arrangement, Wayne repeated. Yes. Now hear me out: what if we funded The Wayne Darnus Center for User Priorities? The Wayne Darnus Center for User Priorities. I like the sound of that. I thought you would. Now well give you a startup grant to help you establish and operate the center, which will keep on doing the good work youre doing to promote NNA. Um, OK. To start with, I was thinking of an initial grant of around three million dollars. Wayne coughed suddenly but soon regained his composure. Um, yes, well, I think that should be able to cover our initial operations.
 
Perfect. Theres just one more catch. Oh, Wayne said, his voice falling a bit. What? Well, here at Google we dont want to make a big show about how were helping the Web. So its essential our donation remain anonymous. Anonymous? Yeah, you know how whenever you go to a museum or something like that it always says Generous donations by anonymous? Thats just how it works in philanthropy. Oh, I see, Wayne said.
 
So well be doing it exactly like that. The actual money will be donated to you by a shell corporation called Rinaldi Tile, Inc. which we use for these kinds of special projects and well have you sign a confidentiality agreement prohibiting you from disclosing the real source. You know, all the usual stuff. Uh huh, Wayne said, a bit skeptically. And then well send you the three million dollars. Sounds great! Wayne said quickly Where do I sign? Ill have my assistant send over the papers in just a little bit. Perfect. Been a pleasure working with you. See you later. Bye.
 
Samuel hung up the phone and saw smiling faces around the conference table. He smiled back and got up to take a mock bow. The room applauded.

I think the novel really picked up at the Google point. For the first time theres a sense of suspense, interest, whats going to happen next, is this a conspiracy, is it based on reality, etc, etc. I think Id have given up on the novel by now otherwise.
 
So far its been all character descriptions, setting the plot, laying out the foundations, but now Im hooked, now I want to know whats going to happen. Previously, I was curious about the characters, but ultimately not that bothered.
 
I might start writing myself, I was at a NaNoWriMo meeting last night :)

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 2
 
Downtown San Francisco is a world of carefully-gridded streets and
looming skyscrapers, but hidden behind a gas station on Third is a place
that almost looks like another world. The sun shines brightly upon a
park with green grass and tall shady trees and vibrant swings with
children. The park is an oval and the perimeter is lined with small,
pastel-colored buildings. Here and there are a smattering of small cafes
and restaurants. And the other buildings are filled with startups.
Twitter here. Adaptive Path there. Even Yahoo, when it wanted to
encourage its employees to be more startup-y, opened up an office in the
neighborhood. Sit on the grass and chances are youll sit near a friend
from another company or bump into them in line at a cafe. The place
crawls with companies and back on the street, surveying the scene with a
distant but watchful eye, lie the journalists, whose publications cover
with awe the rumblings of those below. It was here that Newsflip made
its home.
 
Jason entered the building expecting to be greeted warmly by the
relaxed startup world. Instead, the scene he entered was utter chaos.
Get me CNN! shouted a man at the front of the room, apparently to no
one in particular. Others buzzed at their desks, shouting to one another, shouting at their phones, shouting at their computers, shouting at their coffee mugs. One guy just seemed to keep spinning around in his chair for no reason in particular.
 
Jason stood around surveying the scene for a moment until a man standing up motioned for him to come over. What do you mean we cant get CNN? he shouted into his phone. This is America. He placed his hand over the phone and looked down. You must be Jason, he said. Uh, yes, sir. Are you Goddamn it, I dont care if you have to buy it, I want a 5 minute segment on Wolf Blitzer. He covered the phone again. Its great to have you on the team, son. Jason thought this was a bit fast to be adopted as a son, but didnt feel like he could press the point.
 
Look I dont have time for this shit, he suddenly barked. Just get me on CNN. He slammed the phone down, sat down on the side of the desk, and adopted an avuncular tone. Let me tell you a little story, he said. Uh, OK, Jason said, but the man talked right over him.
 
One day, not long after I graduated college, I was waiting at a bus stop. And sitting there on the seat beside me was a magazine, opened to an article about a newspaper. So I read the article and it just took my breath away. Took my breath away. And I said to myself, Self, one day youre going to be running a newspaper like that. Well, it took me twenty years to do it, but here I am. Sure, technically we dont use paper, but we print news all the same, right? Anyway, isnt that amazing?
 
Jason just smiled and nodded.
 
Of course, I didnt get there just by sitting back and watching. No, sir. I got there by joining someone elses startup, seeing how it was done, and then using what Id learned to turn around and start a new company to destroy their main product. Heh, heh. Well, I guess what Im saying is that I better keep an eye out on you. Better keep an eye out on you.
 
Jason looked a bit worried. And puzzled.
 
Anyway, as you can see things are a bit crazy around here. He waved his arm past the still-chaotic room. So I better get back to work. But Im sure youll settle in fine  and if theres any trouble you just let me know. Good luck! he added and then picked up the phone again and started screaming without even dialing.
 
Looking for his desk, Jason wandered around the office for a bit, past the spinning, screaming, slacking employees, until he found an unused desk over in a corner. There was a memo on it, addressed to him, reminding him of the companys copyright and confidentiality commitments that hed signed, which he promptly tossed in the trash.
 
He sat down and began inventorying the other contents of the desk: a flat screen monitor, a dual-processor tower, an IP phone, a keyboard, a mo. He noticed a tugging at his leg and looked down. He sprang back. There was a girl beneath his desk. Sssssssh! she whispered and motioned for him to come towards her. Slowly and awkwardly, he crouched down and crawled towards the girl. She pulled him under the desk with her and extended her hand.
 
Hi, Im Sarah, she said. He shook it. Hi, Im, uh, Jason. Hey, Jason! Welcome aboard the team. So, why are we down here? Because its crazy up there, silly. Why get involved in all that screaming mess when we can just slip off in the storm and hang out by ourselves? I guess. Whats all the fuss about, though? Oh, just some tech pissing contest. Some blowhard with a webcam doesnt like some tech decision some intern made and now everybodys going DEFCON 5. Actually, DEFCON 5 is the lowest level of military activation. I think you probably mean DEFCON 3. She just looked at him. He looked back and realized he should probably shut up.
 
So Sarah, what do you do here? he ventured. Im in charge of training newbies, silly, she said, and ruffled his hair. Catch me if you can! she added, before darting out from under the desk and running across the office. Jason followed in pursuit.
 
She ran to the middle of the roll of desks, then crouched down and rolled under one of them to the next row. Jason kept running to the end of the row to try to head her off at the pass, doing his best to dodge the spinning chairs and thrown balls that were filling the office. Sarah made a bee-line for the door, stopping only to grab the skateboard lying next to it, which she used to skitter down the stairwell. Jason hopped the whole flight after her.
 
Reaching the bottom, she sped out the door just as an overweight man was opening it to enter. He jumped out of the way and screwed up his face in anger. Dont you know who I am? he shouted down the street at her. Nope, replied Jason, running out the door after her.
 
On the street, she skateboarded around baby strollers, old people, and dazed-looking hipsters like a pro, while Jason was jogging as fast as he could just to keep up. She jumped lights right before traffic, took bizarre shortcuts and side-streets, and occasionally turned back to laugh at him. After a couple blocks of this she jumped up onto a railing and headed into a park. The next thing Jason knew she was halfway up a tree in the middle of a park surrounded by shopping malls and people. Jason hadnt come this far just to give up at a tree, so he scurried up afterwards, finding himself balanced precariously on a branch. Once again he found himself in a secluded spot surrounded by people, sitting alone, facing Sarah.
 
Not bad, kid, she said.
 
Wayne ambled in and pressed the button for the elevator. Once he got to the office Trent spotted him at the door and, screaming a few last words into his phone before slamming it down, headed over and led Wayne into a conference room. The office got silent as he walked by. Fans!, he thought.
 
Trent shut the door behind him. Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, so good to see you! Good to see you too, Trent! Whats it been? A couple years? Yeah, must have been that ETech two years ago. The one with that Bezos keynote. Wayne laughed. How could I forget?
 
Anyway, as Im sure you know I invited you here because we were all very hurt by your comments on your show yesterday. Oh, that silly thing? Well I certainly hope no one was too offended. I was just sharing some concerns I had with the changes you were making. Thats all. If you had concerns you should have just taken them to us. My door is always open to you. You know that.
 
Wayne looked at him. Actually, I dont. Lets be frank here. If I try to get an appointment with any startup in this city they push me off on the calendar and jerk me around until three months have gone by and theyve closed their B round of funding and the VCs have hired a professional public relations team to professionally sit and ignore comments from people like me. But if I talk about it on my show I get ushered into your conference room the next morning. So lets not play dumb here. You know as well as I how this game works.
 
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, trent said shaking his head. What do you want? Do you want us to use this NNA thing? Done! You got it. It doesnt make any difference to me. I dont even know what the hell the thing does. Look, what do you need from us? Is that all?
 
Thanks, Trent. Youre a sweetheart. Thatd be great. Well Im glad we could settle this so easily. You know, Wayne, if you ever need anything else, just give me a ring. My door is always open. Hell, I dont even have a door! Heh, heh. Of course, Trent. Thanks so much. Here, let me see you out.
 
Trent ushered Wayne to the door. Oh, there is one more thing, Wayne added. Sure, what is it? Trent asked. Well, Ive just been noticing in my referer logs that traffic from Newsflip has been dropping sharply lately. Really? I had no idea, Trent replied. Now Im not asking for any special treatment here. Mo, goodness no, of course not. But if you guys could just look into the anomaly. Try to figure out what could be going haywire. That would be great. Oh, of course Wayne. Ill put my top guy on it. Thanks so much, Trent. Lets keep in touch. Lets.
 
All day, people came back and forth through Yerba Buena Park, while Jason and Sarah hung from the branches above their heads, talking. Indeed, hours passed before Jason even thought to consult his watch. Jason was used to seeing other people as a necessary evil: curiosity and courtesy were behaviors he had worked hard to learn to imitate so that others didnt find him too strange, but he did his best to make sure other people took no more than a couple hours of his time.
 
Sarah was different. She was the only person hed ever talked to who made him feel completely relaxed in his own skin. He didnt have to worry about being someone else or trying to be interesting or checking the time. They just talked and talked and laughed and laughed.
 
Sarah looked up at the sun overhead where it hung suspended above the park. Hey, lets go grab some lunch she said, and swung down, branch to branch, before leaping to the ground. Jason followed, smiling.
 
Wayne got back in front of the camera and pressed the button.
 
Alright, for todays Internet Hero segment, where I keep an eye out for the other people who are keeping an eye out for you. Id like to give a big shout-out to one of my favorite Internet startups, Newsflip. I had a great conversation today with Newsflips CEO, Trent Rayburn, and he told me a bit about Newsflips philosophy and strategy and I have to say, Im 100% on board.
 
There are a lot of companies out there that just dont understand users. They think you, the people who make their companies run, are just people to be spat on and squeezed for cash. Not at Newsflip. Theres a company that puts users first. And I salute them for it. So thats todays Internet Hero: Newsflip.

Title: Bubble City: Chapter 1
 
Tick. Slip off backpack, place on table, slide out laptop, place in bin.
Take out wallet, take out cell phone, take out loose change, place in
bin. Face straight forward, wait for signal, walk through slowly,
collect stuff. Tock. Jason did not waste time.
 
At the gate he read a magazine, on the plane he read a book, on the bus
he checked his email. He went through familiar motions as if he had cut
from them each unnecessary effort. He analyzed every moment of his life
with an unsparing critical eye. He walked down hallways with purposeful
strides  well, as purposeful as one can be if one is a gangly teenager
attempting to carry a duffle bag bigger than oneself.
 
The woman behind the glass yelled at him as he tried to squeeze the
duffle bag through the turnstile. The bus dropped him off five city
blocks from his destination. His destination was closed and locked and
empty and unfeeling and he was trapped alone carrying everything he
owned in a city he barely knew.
 
A cab sped by.
 
Trent stood up from his desk. Sometimes he did that. He wasnt going
anywhere or signaling something. He just liked standing up and looking
out over all that he surveyed. He savored the feeling of being at the
pinnacle of achievement. He didnt think hed ever get tired of that
feeling.
 
Over there was the team hed hired away from Microsoft with promises of
a looser corporate culture and better weather. And over there, the
startup hed acquired after reading about them in one of the industry
weblogshe couldnt recall whichand after hardball negotiations
bought them and brought them here. And, over there, the UI
designer, helping all the programmers to make their code more friendly.
He watched them all working as one smooth harmonious unit.
 
He sat back down and looked over the days schedule. First, a staff
meeting. He flicked through his PowerPoint one last time and then headed
to the conference room to set up the projector. At 9:00 the computers of
every employee simultaneously chimed with an on-screen alert announcing
that a meeting was supposed to begin. But, as usual, the programmers
were so deeply engrossed in their work that they didnt even hear the
bell. Staff meeting, he shouted, but still no one moved. Oh, those
programmers. How dedicated!
 
He walked around the cubicles, pulling headphones off ears to make sure
everyone got the news. They got up and followed him to the conference
room. God, programmers have such odd dazed looks and slackened jaws.
Spending that much time in front of a screen really must be bad for your
expression.
 
Once everyone was settled in the conference room, he flipped to the
first slide. 25,000 it proclaimed in white block letters against a
stark black background. 25,000 he said out loud, just to hammer the
point home. We have to do better, he said.
 
Now I know all of you are working hard. Dont think I dont see the way
you all hurry back from lunch exactly at 1 and get back into the groove, typing furiously and shouting. He heard some muffled noises from the
back of the room. He smiled; they thought he didnt notice.
 
But 25,00 is just not enough. I want 30,000. Alright. The other piece
of news is that weve got a new guy coming in today. Hes one of the top
students from this years class at MIT, so Im sure hell be an amazing
addition to the team. I hope youll all help him get acquainted with the
system.
 
OK, I guess thats it. Now back to work! he shouted, and laughed. He
loved to keep the mood light.
 
Back at his desk, he checked the days schedule. Some phone calls, then
a lunch meeting, then a bit of a break so he could put the finishing
touches on his spreadsheets, then one more meeting ending right at 5 so
he could race out the door to his parked car and head home to his loving
wife.
 
Lazy day. Sarah slid out of bed and tossed on a tshirt and some panties. Her bare feet tip-toed across the wooden floor as she rummaged around the kitchen for something that might be made into a kind of breakfast. Some granola over here. A bit of fruit over there. Just add a bowl and a spoon and youre done.
 
She ate it at the kitchen counter while flicking through the days email on her laptop: George, John, Tom, James, Jim  delete, delete, delete, delete, delete. Sigh, no mail again. She checked a couple blogs, splashed some water on her face, threw on pants, and grabbed her skateboard, tossing it out the window. Her bare feet soon followed. She didnt wear shoes.
 
Dodging traffic on Mission Street ought to be some kind of videogame.
Swerving past this street vendor only to dive in front of that old mans
cart, then around again past the giggling children and ducking under the
flailing arms of their screaming parents. And that was just the
sidewalk.
 
At the office she hurried past the programmer cubicles, their windows
streaming last nights YouTube highlights and some networked videogames
and the requisite bluster of the Wayne Darnus show. She slid down into
her chair and plotted yet another day of how she was going to persuade
the programmers to stop making their interfaces so horrible. In other
words, another day of dealing with unceasing, uncomprehending
rejection.
 
Wayne woke up happy, as he always did. Then he sat down at his computer to read the news. One hand clicked through each headline, his blood pressure rising at each fresh outrage, while the other hand grabbed handfuls of cereal from the box he kept by the side of his desk. As he crunched through the dry cereal, its sharp edges lacerating his gums, he felt his anger turn to rage until he could no longer contain himself. So he turned on his camera.
 
He popped open the recording software, making sure he got his nose squarely in its frame, his face so close that spittle would land on the lens. In a world where every teenage kid could stream a live feed of himself having sex to millions, only the most aggressive vlogcasters survived. Wayne was no dummy. He didnt get to be the number seven blog in the TechnoScene rankings by sitting back and offering his opinions. No. This was war and every show a battle.
 
Todays enemy? Newsflip, one of the crummy little online news aggregator sites, which was threatening to write him out of the history books by dumping the technology hed single-handedly invented, news notation analysis (NNA), and going with some upstart competitor that didnt even bother to have an acronym for a name. Sure, Newsflip was a tiny site in the scheme of things, but if it switched it would set a dangerous precedent.
 
He pressed the button and watched the light go green. Goooooood
morning, he said, with his best attempt at the cheerful voice that
Californians love. I was seriously disheartened to hear about some
dangerous changes afoot at Newsflip.  The company plans to abandon their
users by abandoning their support for NNA. Now longtime viewers will
remember how hard we fought to get NNA adopted. And you won: now NNA is
used on every major news site, is built into Windows and Macs, forms the
basis of the modern online news ecosystem.
 
Newsflip wants to turn their back on all that by getting rid of NNA.
They claim theyre doing it to make things simpler for users. But how is
it simpler for users to get rid of one of the key features that they
depend on?
 
But frankly, I think the biggest loser if this move goes forward will
be Newsflip. Now, Im not saying that all of you should go out and
boycott Newsflip, but as users I do think you should make your opinions
heard. Ive always said, technology is about the user. Without you,
thered be no technology business. I think Newsflip might need to be
reminded of that.
 
He pressed the button again and the light blinked off. There. That
ought to show them.

Title: Bubble City: Preface
 
November is National Novel Writing Month, or NaNoWriMo. The idea, as far
as I can discern, is that more people ought to be writing novels. But
whether this is for us or them is not clear.
 
Novels have an odd place in our culture. They can be capital-L
Literature, as in the Great American Novel. Or they can be
entertainment, as in romance or mystery novels. Or, and perhaps best,
they can capture the essence of a place or time by using it as the
backdrop for a story.
 
In this way, a novel is disguised memoir, as anyone who is friends with
a novelist can readily discern. And, like a memoir, writing them can be
therapeutic, exorcising a writers demons, while hopefully being more
entertaining.
 
Over the next month I will be serializing a novel, Bubble City, in this space, one chapter every day. NaNoWriMo requires novels be at least 50,000 words in length and thirty days hath November, so Ill aim for 1666 words a day, although if I get lazy I may make some days shorter if I go over on previous ones.
 
There are lots of reasons not to read
it: I have no experience writing long-form fiction, I will be writing
this live and thus bound to errors I make in previous chapters, you will
undoubtedly be negatively portrayed in it, I have not really planned
this out, and I have no great things to say. Each posts title will
begin with Bubble City: so you can easily ignore them.
 
That said, if you want to read a yarn about the denizens of San
Francisco startups, the power they presume to have over the world, and
what happens when programmers get in over their heads, stay tuned.

Title: How to Build Decent Productivity Software
 
These days it seems like everyone is making productivity software  software that helps you manage all the the things you need to get done. Yet all of them seem to be missing some basic pieces. A productivity application has two jobs: remembering everything you need to do and getting you to do it. The second is necessary because without it, youll put all your tasks in the application and then never do them. The first is necessary because otherwise the application will have no idea what to tell you to do.
 
I think the ideal piece of productivity software would be like having a great assistant or a campaign manager: someone who intimately knows all aspects of your lifes todo lists and schedules and wasnt afraid of saying you had to wrap this meeting up because you promised the kids youd be home at 5 to take them to the game. Judged against this standard, present productivity software is woefully lacking  its usually not much more than a glorified todo list.
 
Remembering everything: Most software lets you store the classical todo list items: call Jon back, finish report, buy toy for kids.1 Some systems even branch out into vaguer life goal stuff: spend time with family, become accomplished novelist, learn more about history. But thats about it.
 
But most people also have tasks in their project management software (fix this bug), various calendar-style events (lunch with Jon, catch plane), and a vast quantity of email (answer Jons question, fix the frobnitz and report back to Bob, etc.) Yet no one seems to have dared to integrate their software with a calendar, email client, or even bug tracking software.
 
Since its unlikely anyone writing productivity software is also going to write an email client, a calendar, and a bug tracker (although it would be nice), Ill settle for having support for plugins that import tasks and events from these various other apps. It has to be very simple to upload your whole life to your todo app.
 
Getting you to do stuff: The best Ive seen is some kind of filtering in which the software lets you only look at tasks that can be done in 5 minutes while on a train. But if youre the kind of person whos dysfunctional enough to need productivity software, simply having a big list of tasks probably isnt going to help you much. (I can write a big list of tasks in Notepad.) Instead, the software should be proactive about getting you to do stuff, like telling you to quit goofing off and get ready for that big deadline you have tomorrow or to hurry up and answer that urgent email from yesterday.
 
How does it do this? First, it needs to know whats important. After you import your life it should let you walk through and triage it all: look at each one and decide how important it is (or whether its already done). Ive written a program to do this just for my mail and its been invaluable  within a couple hours a morass of three thousand messages turned into a neatly labeled set of piles ordered by importance. Similarly, it can turn a tall pile of assorted todos into the beginnings of an action plan.
 
Then comes the crucial part: it tells you what to do. Im not demanding anything fancy, like a robot dog that follows you around and barks orders (although that might be nice). Im just saying provide a little pop-up window with a suggested next task. Psychologically, its easy to ignore a long todo list. In fact, long todo lists are depressing and make you want to look away. But a simple suggestion about one particular thing to do next is much harder to dismiss.
 
Of course, the suggestions have to be good. The software would generate them by taking into account everything it knows about your tasks and calendar today. And if you still dont like the suggestion, you tell the program you cant do it because:
 
and so on. Ideally, the system would be well-informed and smart enough that you could trust its predictions. But even if it wasnt perfect, just suggesting tasks in order of priority would likely be a vast improvement over the whimsical system used by most people in need of productivity software. Its hard to imagine such a tool wouldnt be a godsend.
 
Aaron Swartz has too large of a todo list to write this program by himself, but if youre interested in working on it hed love to help. Email him at me@aaronsw.com
 
(Postscript: Dearest readers, telling me that your favorite glorified todo list has an API that allows me write all the importers I want as well as write the task suggestion system I described is not an answer. My point is that todo lists should have these features; not that they should allow me to write them.)
 
Most of the classical productivity guides are aimed at middle managers whose lives, as far as we can tell from the examples, consist of calling people, finishing reports, and placating their families. Who am I to break with tradition?

http://orgmode.org/ seems to solve lots of these problems; Ive just started using it, and its a great organizer with some easy customizations. Also, the developer(s?) are quite responsive to bug reports and suggestions.
 
Its an emacs mode, which 1) may rule it out for many users, and 2) means it wont do obtrusive popus. But other than that, it seems like 90% of what youre looking for.

Ive been using Remember the Milk for about a year now, and it seems to provide most of what you describe (and what I consider essential in a todo app).
 
You can email tasks in, which is a great low barrier interface to the system. I set filters to forward email I get, when appropriate, to my todo list. When  a new bug gets assigned to me in Launchpad, for example, it gets forwarded to my todo, with the correct tags (depending on the project the bug is in). Of course, this setup relies on me maintaining it.
 
I tag all my tasks by context (tasks for which I need to be connected to the net, tasks for which I need to be at home, shopping I need to do when Im on the high street), priority and time estimate, so its always easy to find out what I should work on next.
 
RtM can talk to me via Jabber, so I dont even need to use the web interface just to find out that its time for that next task.
 
RtM has a pretty good API, so its easy to write plugins, but I havent seen anything yet that connects other sources of data (I rely on the email interface alone, but it requires me to be an email hacker, which I understand not everyone can be).
 
RtM has a great user interface, its a pleasure to use, and since theyve added Google Gears support I even have my tasks offline.
 
But RtM doesnt seem to have truly taken off - it looks like it was designed to fit perfectly with one of the major online app providers, but so far it doesnt look like it generated much interest. I think I know why - an efficient todo app isnt a something thats ever going to be popular, because most people dont actually want to be productive.
 
If you take a look at what applications are generating most interest and money these days, it is stuff that helps people be less productive and suppress the necessary bad feelings that come with boredom and impotence, not something that reminds them that they should get back to work.

I just broke out of my feed reader to tell you about rememberthemilk.com too.  It has priorities, time estimates, physical contexts and due dates as you outline above.  It doesnt have dependencies.  I deal with them by setting a future due date which causes them to disappear from my action smart list.
 
You can use the excellent search to find tasks matching whatever criteria you need.  And you can save any search as smart list which is then viewable just like any of your other lists.
 
I fire tasks to it with a little ruby script I wrote from the terminal.
 
It isnt perhaps what you are dreaming of although it isnt far off either.  Perhaps some program sitting above the API could use the search capability to do the next task is  ? prompting?

I really like your not now and heres why approach, even if the end result is that you realize that you no longer have any excuse to not be doing a particular task.
 
I would maybe add a I dont have the energy excuse, if only for tracking and learning when youre likely to finally complete that cringe-worthy task youve been avoiding.
 
One thing that would be handy for me is an urgency curve, or at least a selection of urgency profiles like deadline, appointment or steadily increasing risk of attracting flies.

Heh, Ive probably been working on this for about a decade now, but am too lousy at getting things done to have much to show
 
Latest version Im playing with is using a quick & dirty desktop app to post stuff off to my online Personal Knowledge Base. Ive got the posting-off side done, not got onto task editing etc. yet. The first priority was to be able to log & view what Ive done, and that bit I have got going:
http://danja.talis.com/timegrid/
http://dannyayers.com/2007/10/04/a-little-dogfood
 
A critical point (IMHO) is not to hardwire any particular user interface to the data store, so you can hook up existing tools (like OSAF, as mentioned above) to a common store. Which means using a flexible data model alongside well-defined protocols - the obvious choice being Semantic Web tech. The basic modelling can easily be covered by RDF/OWL, the prioritisation etc being added as a fairly lightweight numberic layer on top.
 
Over the years Ive played with mapping between quite a few related tools and the common model*, although this time around the only one Ive so far hooked up has been a todo.txt parser. (Guess I should do a todo.txt renderer soon).

hello,
 
your post is very interesting. I have been working for the last month on researching and implementing a manufacturing scheduling algorithm for a small furniture workshop. I was totally ignorant of the field a few months ago but it was a very interesting experience. Anyway: I read your entry with this bias and the system you sketch here seems very close to problems that I have been working on recently with this project.
 
I discovered that one of the key aspect is that it is not so much a data architecture problem, nor it is an interface design challenge: as you noted it should integrate into already built data and interface systems, plus the data to record is quite straightforward (dates, text, dates) so the difficult and interesting bit to figure out is the recommendation or prioritization algorithm. To produce a sufficiently well done algorithm thatll prompt you with a relevant list of five things to consider doing just now and can minimally learn how to do so as you use it.
 
And more than that there is some times where the system should not prompt me anything to do and be elegantly silent: there are activities that I do with pleasure and without any exterior incentive, reading books, drawing, cooking, doing nothing
 
This seems essential in order for me to be able to rely on such a system. If it was constantly and bluntly pushing his five relevant things to me I would stop doing what he says. And there are some times where it would be encouraging to have quasi empty list that says for example: do just one thing and you are done for now
 
The rules that you started to lay down on the end of your post seems very pragmatic and right to start in this direction. Today it seems to me that a library of code that implement such prioritization and task recommendation processes would be the best contribution to the field. In the domain of manufacturing scheduling among several other interesting examples: http://www.frepple.com/

Title: Area Scientists Study Confirms Own Prejudices
 
CAMBRIDGE, MAIn a study published today in the prestigious journal Nature, Harvard professor Dr. Thomas Jacobson, an expert in the field of physical neuroscience, finds that the gangly cortex, the area of the brain associated with stumbling, fumbling, and general klutziness, is smaller in members of the Red Sox sports team than in other major league baseball players.
 
The study, entitled Differential Size Analysis of the Gangly Cortex In Professional Sports, was conducted using a technique called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or fMRI, in which brain activity is observed on a computer monitor while subjects perform a mental activity. In his fMRI studies, Dr. Jacobson noted significantly less mental activity in the gangy cortex of Red Sox players when he asked them to visualize various aspects of a baseball game.
 
Obviously far more research needs to be done, explained Dr. Jacobson, but this evidence does appear to support the popular belief that Red Sox players are just better than everyone else.
 
The study could have major implications for the entire field of physical neuroscience, which examines how differences in the brain can affect performance in various types of strenuous physical activity, including baseball, American football, running the mile, hockey, and the biathlon.
 
I havent seen the study but I think its extremely brave work, said former Harvard President Lawrence Summers when asked to comment. Theres an academic orthodoxy of political correctness that says you shouldnt inquire too much into the differences between sports teams. Well, Dr. Jacobson has thrown that out the window and science is better off for it.
 
The study appears in the July 27th issue of Nature, along with new research showing that eating chocolate is good for your heart, Jews are just smarter than everyone else, semen makes women happier, and all women are bisexual. A new study showing that having sex with scientists is associated with a 20-point increase in IQ is expected to be released soon.

Even gay men who deny their own homosexuality will become more sexually aroused by male sexual stimuli than by female stimuli.
 
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/06/030613075252.htm
 
They know these man are gay even though they deny their homosexuality! Wether the scientist spy these people at home or they throw a bunch of bones to know if the man is really a gay.
 
Thats really bad science.

Title: Dear Colleagues: Orders from Chinas Minister of Internet Censorship
 
from Journey to the Heart of Internet Censorship
 
The Xinhua exclusive Who is most hurt by the Web? is available at the follow address: http://news.xinhuanet.com/focus/2006-05-08/content_4494204.htm. It contains many articles, so each site is asked to put a link on its home page so that Internet users can read them directly on the Xinhua site. This will reduce the amount of work for each site. (9 May 2006)
 
The website Qianlong has already posted a news report about a change in the increase in Beijing taxi fares (http://beijing.qianlong.com/3825/2006/05/19/134@3182655.htm). All sites are asked to put it in their news section, but not in a prominent position, to not put it on their front page, and to stop comments on the subject. (19 May 2006)
 
You are asked not to cover the matter of the real estate auction of public land at Dadun Beidingcun, in the Chaoyang district of Beijing. (22 May 2006)
 
Regarding the news report, After a programming revision, the CCTV central television station has decided to stop broadcasting the national anthem, websites must not post it, refer to it or comment on it, and those that have already posted it should take it down. Step up monitoring of forums, blogs and comments on the news, and suppress offensive or insulting reports as quickly as possible. Comply strictly with these instructions! (27 May 2006)
 
A few agitators got residents in Dongzhou (in the southern district of Shanwei) to commit an act of vandalism on a windmill and attack the police on 6 December. The competent authorities are in the process of taking measures to resolve this problem, and the trial of those responsible for this unrest is taking place right now. The leading news media in Guangdong province and thewebsites Nanfang Xinwen, Jinyang, Dayang and Shenzhen Xinwen are currently covering the case and will publish articles on this subject on 24 and 25 May. No news websites from other provinces should cover the case or post articles on the subject. Discussion forums, blogs and comments must not talk about the subject. (22 May 2006)
 
Dear colleagues, regarding the death of a radio presenter while she was at the deputy mayors home, do not disseminate any reports, do not send any new articles, withdraw those that have already been posted on the site, and ensure that forums, blogs and messages no longer refer to this case. Please reply. (30 May 2006)
 
Dear colleagues, the Internet has of late been full of articles and messages about the death of a Shenzhen engineer, Hu Xinyu, as a result of overwork. All sites must stop posting articles on this subject, those that have already been posted about it must be removed from the site and, finally, forums and blogs must withdraw all articles and messages about this case. (17 June 2006)
 
Regarding the issue of unequal income distribution, please use articles from the Central Committees main information mouthpieces and nothing else. Please do not spread rumours about this matter or conduct online polls. Please reinforce monitoring of comments, discussion forums and blogs and immediately block any violent or obscene message. (28 June 2006)

Somehow Im made wonder if a similar but far subtler message isnt disseminated among major media outlets in the United States. The number of things that seem to get either missed or ignored by the big media.
 
To cite one example, try looking for mention of Reverend Lennox Yearwood Jr. being beaten by police outside the Gen. Petraeus hearing earlier this year. Somehow, MSNBC, ABC News, CBS News, and CNN (their web available content, anyway) all missed the story, which I thought wouldve been a huge deal.
 
Somewhat puzzlingly, the only major network to come through were Fox News, but I suppose a black man being beaten for no reason is their viewerships idea of entertainment.

Title: The Joy of Public Speaking
 
A few months ago I was asked if I wanted to give a talk (via videoconference) to a technology conference in India. Being extraordinarily bad at saying no, I said yes. I asked what they wanted me to talk about and they said I could speak about whatever I liked. I thought about it for a while and concluded that I should talk about my life and how I got out of a small town in the middle of the country and ended up working with famous people. Due to a timing screw up, I didnt get to spend as much time on it as I liked, but I did my best. I can put the draft up if anyone wants it. (Update: Heres the talk, as prepared.)
 
(My hope was that talking about all these things would give people lots of different subjects to ask questions on, and then I could go into more detail about whatever interested people. But oddly, the questions were instead mostly about the few things Id left out of the narrative. I wonder if that means I addressed everything in enough detail that I answered all their questions or whether I didnt talk about the things they actually cared about.)
 
Giving a talk via videoconference is a painful thing. First, your disembodied head is looming six feet tall over a room of people. Its hard to imagine thats attractive to anyone other than Big Brothers most ardent fan. Second, you have only the blurriest view of the audience youre speaking to. Third, you cant hear whether theyre laughing or not, because if you get an audio channel then all you hear is the delayed sound of your own voice repeated back to you  which is incredibly distracting  so instead all you get is silence. Its incredibly difficult to connect with an audience under these conditions.
 
Still, I did my best, and Im told it went reasonably well. I sure had fun  theres a real buzz you get from speaking before an audience, whether its on the radio or via videocast or in person. Suddenly your depression and thirst and hunger melt away and you just light up with enthusiasm and energy. The students who filled the room I was addressing applauded and thanked me; but in truth I really owe a debt to them.
 
(P.S. If you did attend the talk, Id love your honest feedback on how it went. Send me email at me@aaronsw.com or post a comment. Thanks!)

Title: Was Rachel Carson a Mass Murderer?
 
A new issue of one of my favorite magazines, Extra! is hitting the streets, with a blurb for my article inside on the cover. When I decided to get into political journalism, Extra! was the first magazine I turned to. Every other month they issue a brilliant magazine full of articles which collect and dissect the standard media narratives on a particular issue and then lay out the real story for you. Its invaluable. I think of their work as a good digest of the news: you get the same misinformation youd get everywhere else but you also get how and why its misinformation.
 
For my first piece, I decided to take on the noise machine thats been loudly proclaiming in news outlets across the land that the environmentalist movement, headed by Rachel Carson, is responsible for the deaths of millions of African babies. Why? Because they discouraged the use of the noxious pesticide DDT, which was previously used for controlling the spread of malaria.
 
For the article, I dug into the science, interviewed the man behind the misinformation campaign (Roger Bate, a character straight out of Thank You For Smoking), and corrected claims from right-wing think tanks (no, Rachel Carson did not kill all those babies) and from blogs (no, the whole misinformation campaign is not funded by the tobacco companies).
 
You can read the full article on Extra!s website or Ive put up a version linking to all my sources.
 
An interesting footnote: As I noted above, Roger Bate insisted he had not been funded by the tobacco companies, as many have claimed. Instead, he said, their main original funder was the May and Stanley Smith Charitable Trust. The trust, a $264 million California foundation started by a mining magnate, has the mission of provid[ing] grants to organizations that serve the needs of children, the elderly, the disabled, and the disadvantaged. However, it has also been a major contributor to the libertarian Cato Institute and George Mason University. Bate says that its trustee, Luther Avery, didnt agree entirely with everything I was suggesting but at least thought the debate was worthy of being exposed.
 
In 2001, Luther Avery passed away, leaving his $400,000 a year trustee job to his son, Mark Avery, making Mark the fifth highest-paid foundation executive in the Bay Area (San Francisco Business Times, 11/14/03). But apparently that wasnt enough  Avery stole $52 million from the Foundation and fled to Alaska. (San Francisco Chronicle, 6/10/07). This June he pled guilty and now he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. (U.S. Attorney for Alaska, 3/6/07)

Misconceptions both on the right and the left? Argh thanks for joining the flotilla of enablers that excuse the crimes of the right by pretending both sides are to blame.
 
No, DDT is a meme of the right. Most hardcore right-wingers have heard of it and think DDT is good because the left banned it. Most left-wingers have simply never heard of this idea.
 
You cite a bunch of right-wingers in this story. The closest I saw to someone potentially on the left was an opinion piece you sourced to the San Francisco Examiner  it was by Angela Logomasini of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.
 
This is a case of out-and-out fraud by the right, fraud which has probably killed people in developing countries by discouraging Americans to the right of Bill Clinton from supporting programs that could actually save lives, like drug-treated mosquito nets.
 
Dont be afraid to assign blame where its due. Its the only thing that may save us.

Sorry, it was just too hard to resist my one chance to play the false balance game. Ive changed it to right-wing think tanks and blogs. Is that better?

Africa Fighting Malaria may not have gotten the money, but it sure looks like Bate did through ESEF or CCSI (ESEF folded about that time) and whether they passed it on and used it to found AFM is the real question.
 
With the like of Bate, one has to be precise.

Title: Sweating the Small Stuff
 
So Jottit has launched, only five months after I suggested to my friend Simon that we create a website that was just a big text box people could type stuff into. And there are two ways I look at it. One is: It took us five months to do that? And the other is: We did that in only five months?
 
When you look at what the site does, it seems pretty simple. It has few features, no complex algorithms, little gee-whiz gadgetry. It just takes your text and puts it on the Web. And considering how often I do that every day, it seems a bit odd that it took so long to create yet another way. And then I check the todo list.
 
As Ive said, this is a site I wanted to get every little detail right on. And when you start sweating the small stuff, its frankly incredible just how much of it there is. Even our trivial site is made up of over two dozen different screens. Each one of those screens has to be designed to look and work just right on a wide variety of browsers, with a wide variety of text in them.
 
And thats just making things look good  making them work right is much harder. Each screen does, on average, five or six different things. And each of those things can be done under three or four different modes. Now were up to over 500 different things to do, each of which can have bugs in lots of unthought-of ways. And then, many of these pieces are exposed to users, who can do whatever they want with them  and do. If youre building a site that accepts text from users, you need to think about something that lets some people just paste stuff from emails, others write HTML, others play YouTube videos, while others try to insert malicious text to break things for people.
 
There are lots of features we want to add to Jottit, but before we do any of that we want to make what we have work perfectly. And, at the moment, that means tasks as varied as reporting a bug in a piece of software we use to its developer, configuring the web server to display a nicer error message under certain odd conditions, having another computer monitor the first computer to see if it goes down, figuring out how to tweak the UI to make certain unclear things clearer to people, rewriting some of the text on the site to be nicer, creating a new site to inform our users of updates, making some stuff from our project open source, fixing stuff in other open source projects, testing the site on phones and weird browsers, examining an algorithm we use to see if it needs improvement, and fixing a bug that was just reported by a user. And those are just the things on my todo list!
 
When you look at it that way, its amazing anyone ever builds a website.

It seems a bid odd that you graduated from a top school, Delbert.  Just send your stuff over to Robert Morris to proofread before you publish it next time.  Actually, youre just adding to the corpus of un-proofread websites with all this jotit stuff anyway.  Maybe as a paid service you could automatically forward everything to Robert Morris to proofread before publishing.  At least that would in fact be something.

@Bosco, its barely even Infogami 1.1.  And did you notice what happens if you click the Forgot Password link?  It sends you your original password.  Which means the passwords are stored in plain text.  Didnt Aaron learn anything the last time a well-known database of passwords got stolen?  Evidently they didnt cover hash functions and cryptographic responsibility in his Y Combinator seminars.
 
Incidentally, if anyone wants to set up a web page, I recommend WordPress.

@Matt, the fact that it might be encrypted doesnt help.  Its physical computer theft were talking about here.

@Eric, Im not convinced that the ability to decrypt users passwords is the largest concern when a physical theft occurs.  Who needs a users password when all their data is already accessible.
 
Suppose hashing is still the simplest and safest representation for storage, but its a hassle having to copy and paste a temporary password and then set a new password.

Title: Perfectionism
 
This may be hard for you to believe, but Im something of a perfectionist. I get a special kind of joy out of tweaking every last detail until its just right, making sure each pixel is in its place. Unfortunately, Ive never really been able to indulge this desire on any of my previous projects, either because my skills are too weak (no matter how much time I spend on it, Ill never be able to craft a page like John Gruber can) or because time is too short.
 
At Reddit, for example, we were always rushing-rushing-rushing to get more done. In a recent post, Paul Graham suggests startups can make you rich if you simply make sure to email him once a week. At Reddit we had no such worries: Paul was sure to email us weekly, sometimes even daily, usually asking why we hadnt added any new features to the site lately. (In fairness, it worked, I suppose.)
 
When you get that question once a week, you get to try out many different answers, including questioning the premise. At first I give the usual low-level excuses: we werent feeling well this week, we had to go to a meeting, Alexis was out of town. Then we started in on more general principles: afraid of change, distracted by day-to-day fires, dissatisfaction with the codebase. And once I sent him Slates suggestion that the Eccentrics own egotistical indolence has resulted in self-imposed limits to their skillsat the very least it deprives the world of more of their unique cultural prognostications. (He was not amused.)
 
Paul eventually became convinced that we had written lots of good code but wouldnt release it because we were perfectionists. Knock it off, he would tell us. Its more important to get it up than to get it right. Paul had become convinced that users love seeing new features, it gave them the impression of an exciting vibrant site.
 
There is something to this, of course. But I have a contrary proposal: users love perfectionism. Creating something brilliant is a process of continual refinement: adding bits where theyre needed, chipping off others that arent, and sanding everything smooth once its in place, then polishing it until it gleams. Do one thing, release it, and dont stop releasing improvements until you do it really, really, well.
 
Adding features is part of this, of course, but not at all the whole thing. You cant create a great sculpture just by tossing on more and more clay.
 
Meanwhile, even if users cant immediately see all the subtle details youve added, they begin to add up to a feeling of  if youre talented  delight. The software knows where you want to go and has already laid out the trail. The path is worn smooth and shiny. Everything looks beautiful along the way.  And every day it gets a little bit better.
 
For my next startup, Jottit, thats the plan.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.
 
August 31, 2007
 
The problem with perfectionism is that users can never love what they never see if a product never reaches perfection, the danger is that the the perfectionist either ends up never releasing it, or dumps out something they know is crap when they get sick of it (regardless of how great everyone else thinks it is) and loses interest in it forthwith.

I think Pauls point doesnt contradict yoursit sounds like he was just proposing that you live out loud. I think your first round of users are sort of expecting to be guinea pigs, and you need to carefully take advantage of them for their feedback. Simultaneously, you are stepping through continual refinement. Hopefully you reach a place of relative perfection by the time your next round of users come through the door, because they may not be as forgiving.
 
I think refinement tends to follow a series of arcs where you add features and things until you realize theres too much, then you remove and refine more until theyre back in balance. You could say this about any creative work. The top of the arc is the point where things are at their worst and most cluttered (eg. the four-button-plus-scroll-wheel iPod).

I think the difference between excellence and something that has a lot of investment (time and money) is that special quality called talent.
 
Like your analogy to sculpture and the amount of clay applied: talent is knowing how much clay to apply and where to apply it.
 
Timeless art (Michelangelos sculptures and ceiling work come to mind) have both: earth-shaking talent and a limitless capacity for personal investment in the effort to make that art.
 
Make something that delites you and well see the difference. You may not make any oney but neither did Michelangelo.
 
In the tech world the difference is exemplified by Bill Gates and Gary Kildall. No one remembers CPM any more so we have to use Steve Jobs to illustrate excellence in technology. I can live with that despite the fact that Jobs drives the talent absolutely crazy at times. In the Michelangelo paradigm hes the Pope and not the artist: the patron of great works. Gary Kildall on the other hand genius.

Youre totally wrong. Users could care less about perfection. Things have to sorta work most of the time, sure anything beyond that is engineer OCD.

You can so create a great sculpture just by tossing on more and more clay. If you do it right. OKCupid uses that method, and imho its pretty awesome.

There are 2 things to keep in mind:
 
The quality of a delivered product or feature increases logarithmically with delivery time.
 
The use value of a delivered product or feature decreases exponentially with delivery time.
 
Lets call the point on the time graph where the two plot lines intersect perfect ship date (PSD). Before PSD youre creating value by not shipping and after PSD youre destroying value by not shipping. Since the point is unknowable you have to choose which side of the point youd rather err on.
 
I think history shows that erring on the early side is a better survival strategy than erring on the late side. Worse is better: http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html

I think youre on the right track, but not quite there.  In my view, a product can never be merely functional.  If it doesnt provoke an emotional response, thats critical missing functionality.

Perfection isnt as important as is a well-adapted system.  Determining which functionality best satisfies a majority of the uses for the largest sub-set(s) of your user base will prove more valuable than providing an exceedingly polished set of functions that dont map as well to solving the problems your users are trying to solve.

Title: The Interrupt-Driven Life
 
After what seemed like years working in the Reddit isolation chamber, I begun saying yes to all the interesting projects that came my way as soon as I got out. And there were a lot of interesting projects.
 
I signed up to build a comprehensive catalog of every book, write three books of my own (since largely abandoned), consult on a not-for-profit project, help build an encyclopedia of jobs, get a new weblog off the ground, found a startup, mentor two ambitious Google Summer of Code projects (stay tuned), build a Gmail clone, write a new online bookreader, start a career in journalism, appear in a documentary, and research and co-author a paper. And thats not including all the stuff I normally do. Ive actually been spending most of my time catching up on my 2000 email backlog, reading a book a week, following a bunch of weblogs, and falling in love. (Falling in love takes a shockingly huge amount of time!) Yes, it has been pointed out to me that Im insane.
 
Clearly part of this is that I have some kind of severe psychological problem (an inability to say no, an inclination toward stress, and a nasty habit of coping with stress by submerging myself in new projects). But its not completely failing either. Every project has kind of half-finished. Maybe this is worthless, maybe instead of half-finishing thirteen projects I should just completely finish one. But it doesnt seem obviously stupid  a half-finished project has some value (educational if nothing else) and it seems increasingly likely that some of them will get finished properly.
 
So how is it that Im able to do so many tasks that even I, upon reflection, cant see how theyre all getting done? The secret is to be interrupt-driven. Previously, if I wanted to do something, Id immerse myself in that thing. Id wake up in the morning thinking about the problem, spend all day either working on it, reading background materials for it, talking to friends about it, thinking about it in bed before I went to sleep and then dreaming about it. Im sure I did much better work this way: all that thinking and dreaming led to lots of ideas I wouldnt have had otherwise. And it was fun, too. Immersing yourself in a problem can be very enjoyable. (See Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.) But clearly, you can really only work on one problem at a time this way and it doesnt leave much room for other people in your life.
 
In the new system, for every task I have a partner. And theyre the one responsible for thinking about it. Perhaps they dont immerse themselves in it totally like I sometimes did, but it takes up a substantial portion of their mental energy. And so, after we hash out the big plan together at the beginning, they work on it and think about it and worry about it and when they get stuck or finish a piece or just want to talk about it, they shoot me an email. Meanwhile, I sit at home and just deal with these emails, answering questions and solving problems as they come up.
 
Now while I think giving people a partner on these projects is really valuable (I wish I had one on more of my immersive projects) Ill readily admit that Im lousy at it. Ive been spending too much time ill and traveling and with people in my life to respond promptly or in detail. (Im sorry guys; Im going to work hard to pare things down and do better.)
 
But I think the larger principle is valuable. This is clearly how the real big-shots get things done. Recall the scene in Brazil where the harried executive strolls purposefully (yet aimlessly) through the corridors with a trail of people waving papers behind him to which he barks either yes or no. (Reprised in last weeks Psych.) Of course, when things get that far, its rather unclear whos actually doing things. As with the political figure whose every minute is scheduled by their campaign manager or their chief of staff, one begins to wonder whether the others are working for the boss or whether the boss is simply working for them. In this way, moving up the corporate ladder means giving up more and more of your power and freedom.
 
At some point I plan to go back to the immersive life. I have some big plans that are just important enough to need that kind of dedication. But this is the year of Other People. I cant be everything to everyone, but Ill try my best to get things done.

grad student/thesis advisor

coder/project lead
etc.
 
Note, however, this doesnt work well for anyone who is not in a superordinate social position - otherwise, its just being overloaded with demands beyond control. Anyone who has had to deal with job/spouse/kids near-simultaneously can talk about being interrupt driven, and its no fun.

Love is over-rated, its a bad meme that society loves (pardon the pun) to purpetrate. Based on no scientific research I think most people fall in love with the concept of love rather than the person. And its this concept of love which like a parasite manipulates its host to further its own end - in this case being in love.
 
Dont get me wrong, Im not a cynic. Ive been in love lots of times, but Ive always found that I can always become out of love by simply concentrate on all the negative aspects of the relationship or person. Go on, try it if you dare - spend 20 days only thinking about the negatives and see what happens.
 
Love is nothing more than a perception disorder.

Title: Improving the Foo Camp Format
 
Ive been to several Foo Camps now and always the system has been identical: Get a bunch of meeting rooms of varying sizes. Invite a bunch of the top people you know of in the field. Have them write the schedule.
 
When you first arrive, Tim meets and greets at the door, his associates behind him ask for your name and give you a badge and a t-shirt and a short form to fill out. The form has your name on it and asks a few questions about what you do and who they should invite next year and that sort of thing. Then they take your photo and print it onto the top of the form and put all the forms up on the wall in a huge display that you have to be pretty tall to see all of.
 
You mingle as everyone arrives and then you all cram into a big meeting room. Tim and his compatriots give an opening address welcoming you to the conference and explaining the format. Then everyone (all 300 people or so!) stand up and say their name, affiliation, and three words to describe themselves (usually going over). Sometimes people shout talk when they think the person should give a talk. Then Tim says a few more words and they wheel out huge paper foam boards with the schedule outline printed on them. It lists the name of the room and the number of people it approximately holds at the top and the session times on the side. Then Tim says go and theres a mad scramble to the boards with people pushing each other out of the way to write down their preferred session.
 
This always struck me as a bit silly for a computer company. The people I most want to hear  like aging James Randi  cant exactly push their way to the front of the crowd. And the people who are convinced that their topic is the most important for everyone to go to are usually deathly boring.
 
How would I do it? First, I would put a few words of description on peoples badges and wall-cards. Second, I would put the wall-cards online. (Theyre digital photos anyway.) Third, during the name introductions Id point a video camera at the person introducing themselves and project it onto the big screen up front so that people dont flip around their chairs and crane to see.
 
But the main thing Id do is make people pitch for their sessions. There are a bunch of different ways to do this, but the one I like best at the moment (and thus the one Id try first) is to hand out PRS devices to the audience (these are little hand-held gadgets that send an IR pulse to a computer at the front of the room recording a vote on something) and then have all the people who want to hold a session form a line going towards the back of the room. Each person in the line gets 30 seconds to pitch their session. If people like it, they press a button on the PRS and their vote gets recorded. After the pitch, someone enters the presenter name, the session name, and the estimated length into the computer recording the votes. (If someone in the line wants to hold a similar session, they can consult with the person pitching and merge things.)
 
Once every session has been pitched, the computer does a constraint optimization problem to schedule only the most popular sessions in timeslots with the least conflicts (the computer knows if a person wants to see both James Randi and Eugenie Scott, so it can try to avoid having them speak at the same time) and place them in rooms with the appropriate amount of space. This schedule is printed up and placed on the website, maybe with a few spots reserved for last-minute changes, and this is what people follow.
 
Aside from being a really sexy use of constraint optimization, this solves a lot of problems: people get a little taste of every session, the most interesting sessions are scheduled, conflicts (wanting to see two sessions that are scheduled to the same time) are minimized, rooms are allocated by audience size instead of by ego size. If you want, you can even print up a schedule for each participant, with the computer telling them which is the session they liked most at every timeslot.
 
Buying a bunch of PRSs cant be that expensive  for comparison, Google purchased two nights at a hotel for every guest  and you can reuse them every year. If giving people a chance to pitch their sessions takes too long, you can have them submit a one paragraph description to a web site and let people vote on the web site. If this requires too many attendees have laptops with them, you can have them do this before the conference. But that requires more foresight than I expect the average attendee has, which is why I like the PRS system. Im not sure why OReilly sticks to paper.
 
Update: By email, Peter Kazanjy suggests another variation: have people write their session ideas up on cards, put the cards on the wall, then have everyone make a mark on their top five ideas, then schedule the cards and rooms based on how many marks they have.

Ive been on the outside looking in for a while on this foo stuff, and its interesting to see an analysis on the format.  Thanks.
 
However, this post also illustrates a frustration a wanna-be like myself has with foo:
 
Folks like yourself come out with perspectives on it, and it seems like nifty topics are bandied about, but I have no sense of what actually happens there and what it leads to.
 
Which is just a horrible tease.
 
At the same time I guess I see the point in losing dead weight like myself so the Illuminati can proceed forward with changing the world unhindered by the world thats to be changed.
 
So heres a solution (if you agree its a problem).
 Its quite similar to your PRS idea.
 
Have you ever seen Ken Goldbergs tele-robot dealio?
 
http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/forefront/fall02/telerobot.html
 
Essentially its a real-time choose-your-own-adventure style tour mashed with instant voting.  In all of Goldbergs demos at berkeley there were two actors, an attractive man and woman, dressed in skin tight suits all cyborged up with cameras and what not just walking around interacting with people, and they would be fed lines and instructions by some unruly mob on the net.
 
OReilly should have a few of these folks touring the Foo scene.  This would give us a tour bus through Foo in real time, which would be really cool, and you wouldnt even have to smell our cheeto breath.
 
Thoughts?
 
Regarding your PRS idea: if you want help implementing it with sensor networks (roughly 30 to 50 bucks a head), as opposed to IR, Id be more than happy to lend a hand.  Hell, it may actually get me an invite.

The beauty of Sci Foo is the blend of chance and democracy.  It is true Brownian motion of thoughtful people picked by the organizers.  It seems the meeting is intended to force unscheduled or unintended meetings and associations by people. The Organizers have been careful to select participants  we should trust them.
 
By labeling everybody with their affiliations  Harvard this, or Microsoft that  you introduce an unnecessary filter.  The corporates will go to their sessions and the academics will flock together, etc.  There are lots of meetings like that.
 
I doubt every book Aaron has read was a masterpiece but I hope that every book he has read was instructive in some way and perhaps in an unexpected way.

Aaron,
 
I think youve proposed a great idea and also offered an excellent example; I just had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Randi speak this morning, in fact :).
 
Its not just the issue of physically pushing to the front, by the way, but the way that the current system rewards assertiveness, even aggressiveness and demotes the more humble.  Unfair and unfortunate all round.
 
I havent attended Foo and probably wont be invited to do so anytime soon, but I hope the Foo organizers respect and implement your idea.

Hmm, thats about how we did it at Barcamp Nuremberg last year. Worked OK. But it was below 100 people. We also pre-voted for session interest by raising hands. Even less expensive than the gadget, but admittedly we still had to spent some minutes moving around the yellow notes on the whiteboard.

Session voting and optimization is a fine idea. As mentioned in a previous comment, using SMS may be an inexpensive and easy way to go.
 
I would like to see such meetings have some sort of loose goal (perhaps create one or more once the group is assembled). Again, pitches and quiet expressions of interest may help.
 
Offering suggestions for subsequent year invitees may be better toward the middle of the meeting instead of the beginning.

Title: Sci Foo 2007 Gossip Liveblog
 
Industry heavyweights OReilly, Google, and Nature come together to sponsor a science-focused version of OReillys runaway success FOO Camp, bringing together top people in the field to eat and gab and plot. Our correspondent on the scene at Google headquarters in Mountain View and the conference hotel in Sunnyvale (where Google purchased a room for every attendee) will be providing live updates on the famous and their doings.
 
Martha Stewart is here with her boyfriend Charles Simonyi. Frank Wilczek is just as friendly in person as on TV. Dinner with Nat Torkington and Hal Varian. James Randi just told me to get glasses. Esther and Freeman are here  double Dyson decadence! Paul Sereno, Americas Most Photogenic Paleontologist looks photogenic in person too. Jaron Lanier seems to know everyone.
 
Kid looks past me to ask what the guy next to me does. I look miffed. He looks back at me and says well, come on, everyone knows your story.
 
Tim OReilly kicks things off by singing a duet of I Feel Good. Ted Selker gabs about our distractible mutual friend. Dean Kamen brags about the robots hes seen. Lee Smolin. Eugenie Scott gets a round of applause. Neal Stephenson and Kim Stanley Robinson are sitting together. Lots of comic book artists. Theodore Gray. Chris Anderson. Yossi Vardi says hi. Eric Drexler. Vik Olliver talks about his self-replicating 3D printers. Danny Hillis. George Dyson is also here. Sergey Brin says he likes neck stretches.
 
A quick glance makes it seem about 10% female, but Tim says its more like 23%.
 
Paul Sereno brought a bunch of fossils. Were not supposed to blog them until hes published. Drew Endy talks about domesticating biotech and a summer camp where college freshmen do their own biotech engineering. Felice Frankel shows series of brilliant science photos from her work with G. M. Whitesides and promotes imageandmeaning.org. Saul Griffith and Jim McBride show a series of diagrams to explain energy sources, paths, and usage. Charles Simonyi talks about his time in space. Martha Stewart talks about the food she made for him.
 
The hallways are full of people to talk to  I dont go for a minute before getting into a conversation. Kovas Boguta hints at his latest secret project. Sarah Brown catches up. The famed LH shares her inexhaustible supply of love. Daniel Chudnov of the Library of Congress introduces himself and tells me about the ten terabytes of data they have at Chronicling America. Brady Forrest tells me about the many conferences he worries about.
 
Martha saw one of her subordinates eat food thats been out too long and
worried that she would die of salmonella. Vaughan Bell tells me what its like to study people with psychosis and delusions. A group at breakfast wonders who is the Richard Feynman and Carl Sagan of our era. CSI has driven so many people into forensics that colleges have started whole new programs because of it  can we do the same for the rest of science? Science shows always show us at the university all day, one complains. How come they never show us at the pub or at meetings like this?
 
In one session a group of people discuss their citizen science projects  attempts to let normal people assist them with science. Others talk about visualizing data and transporting huge swaths of it. Google security is frighteningly helpful. Danny Hillis talks in the hallway about buying land for his clock. Jeff Hawkins talks about his neocortical theory. Eugenie Scott speaks on the attacks on evolution. Henry Gee on the Jewish community in London: People are shocked if their rabbi is not a practicing lesbian.
 
I signed up to give a talk.
 
At lunch there was a fellow working on genetically evolving robots, using a 3D printer to make the robots. Zach Kaplan of Inventables had a big bag at the table, from which he kept pulling out the most amazing things  squishy magnets, plastic that expands in water, instant snow, erasable pens, and so on. It was hilariously fun. On the way back in my old friend Chris Anderson said hi and plugged his new startup with the inimitable Adam Goldstein, BookTour. Adam  say hi sometime!
 
Theo Gray demoes Mathematica 6. Ted Kaehler, a lieutenant of Alan Kay, demoes the latest stuff from Squeakland, which has similar demos but for kids and with less elegance. (Dean Kamen got very interested; presumably for FIRST.) Bjrn Lomborg takes his Copenhagen Consensus show on the road. Hugh Reinhoff tells how he diagnosed his daughters congenital illness by sequencing her DNA to find the genetic mutation. (Harvard charges only $3.50 a reaction!) All the stuff you need these days is available on the Web, he explains. But the doctors get totally freaked out.
 
The Google buildings are almost mazelike.
 
George Dyson has a standing-room-only talk on Gdel and the Draft Board. (It was already moved to a larger room once.) The rest of the Dyson family and Martin Rees, President of the Royal Society, are among the numerous in attendance. George Dyson gives a madcap tour of Gdels attempts to become a full professor at the Institute for Advanced Study  a story of endless disappointments which Dyson manages to make quite funny. Its brilliant, if you can look past his standard bits of softheadedness. Freeman Dyson pipes in with stories from his Neal Stephenson notes that Gdel went on to work on lonely philosophical projects and George suggests that the open-ended freedom of the Institute was a bit of a mistake. Tim OReilly wonders if this is a more general lesson. I once paid Larry Wall a salary to do  basically whatever he wanted for a year, he said. I worry that it was the worst thing that ever happened to the Perl community, because that was when Perl 6 turned into what someone called a performance art project.
 
Martha Stewart fills a big room speaking on the Paperless Home. I may not look like it, she says, but Im the typical homemaker. I have a dog, I have a daughter, I have a garden, I have a farm, and I door I did it all myself. And as a homemaker, shes convinced homes need to become computerized. Not too computerized, of course  not like those crazy folks at MIT who want to have refrigerators that talk and coffee makers that do the same thing every day. Stewart wants to preserve traditions too. So shes going to build tools to organize the ultra-tedious tasks of life. Shes very bright, hard-headed, and engaging. So exhausting, says one woman upon the sessions conclusion. We pay people to do that sort of work.
 
Dalton Conley, the persecuted sociologist, and his arthack wife Natalie Jeremijenko gab at dinner. Dean Kamen gesticulates wildly and talks about watching beautiful women who bend down to pick things up. Nat Torkington discusses how OReilly refused to censor his video demonstration of New Zealand culture. Chris DiBona admits he just works at Google (as a grown-up!) so that he can do science tourism. Theo Gray shows me the 3D Table of the Elements he printed out using a lenticular.
 
The Internet here is really wonky.
 
Timo Hannay of Nature introduces himself and welcomes me, giving some clues as to why I was invited. He asks me to explain Science that Matters, which is an odd situation. My proud co-author Jim Hendler gives a talk on the future of science publishing. Paul Ginsparg ducks out to look at Howtoons, where Saul Griffith, who is dating Tims daughter Arwen OReilly, explains that they try to combine emotional stories to attract girls and action at a distance (guns, explodey-things, etc.) to attract boys, and telling the real stories behind discoveries to attract all. Theo Gray talks about the liability issues involved in publishing his Popular Science column. They made sure to get Judith Regan as their publisher so that they could print all sorts of dangerous stuff in their book, only to have her sacked because of the O.J. Simpson debacle. The conversation then devolved into explodey-things you can make at home. But the book should be out soon. It looks great.
 
The WiFi at the conference hotel adds ads to pages. Wow, is that annoying.
 
Eric Bonabeau apologized for being rude to me the other day and explained what his company does  predict human behavior based on modeling cognitive biases. Clearly people arent rational economic actors, he explained. Just look at Quinn Norton.
 
Someone whose name I didnt catch talks about finding which genetic differences increase your risk for getting a particular disease. To get 1x coverage of your genome from Celera costs only $100,000 and 23andMe hopes to do portions of your gene for $1,000. And just doing portions costs tens of dollars. You can browse the genome of Jim Watson and find the genetic mutations unique to him. Perhaps that mutation explains the extreme sexism, jokes Paul Ginsparg. He shows a large study of genetic risk factsors and examines Watson to see if hes at risk.
 
I give my talk. When I start, about 4 people are there, but I charge ahead and 15 or so more people show up. I give a demo of Open Library, which most people miss because they came late. Then we discuss how to open the scientific literature. Ginsparg says that studies have found that about a third of all papers, preferentially high-impact papers, are available for free online. We learn about the ways people keep online bibliographies (including the Drupal modules involved). And someone else suggests that the Wellcome Trust just buy Elsevier and open it up.
 
Natalie helps Dalton set up his computer for their joint session, in which they make somewhat opposite arguments. (They look much less cool when theyre wearing casual clothing.) He covers the problems in studying his book on birth order. He shows that blacks who were called for the draft are less likely to die in later years (which I was shocked about), which he proposes is because the military is the most color-blind institution (he suggests the black-white test score gap is smaller there too). He notes that womens groups prefer the voting records of politicians with daughters (for a potential natural experiment). Roommate lottery finds that each point loss in GPA costs you .25 points and that roommate drinking is a major influence. But once the effects are known, people adjust their social behavior. Thus social scientists are on a treadmill. Carl Bergstrom says he sees similar patterns in evolution  even if the animals are at a draw, you can see if the genome is under heavy selection.
 
Natalie talks about her Urban Space Station project which uses closed systems engineering to create safe urban spaces. Attached shell have a lab, one project of which is the Environmental Health Clinic, where people come with environmental problems and get prescriptions for things to do to help improve their world. One prescription: the greenlight.
 
I wanted to get into a fight with Dalton about the metareliability of these natural experiments but couldnt find him  he and Natalie were too busy taking care of two adorable children. At lunch I explained Open Library to some folks from Nature, then got involved in a discussion making fun of Stephen Wolfram with Chris DiBona and others. I learned the meaning of my Google New York shirt. Jim McBride told me how much he liked STM (which I saw on some other peoples feed readers) and invited me up to their abandoned air traffic control tower. Paul Ginsparg introduced me to Michael Kurtz of ADS.
 
Tim gives the closing speech: he wants to hear what new connections were made, thats his metric for success. Afterwards, I get in a great conversation with Carl Bergstrom who tells me about new features on his Eigenfactor site. Then I bump into Bjrn Lomborg, who is amazed I know about the Copenhagen Consensus. Hes been giving copies of his new book to everyone within throwing distance and stops to amicably persuade me that we should spend less on stopping global warming. Incredibly friendly guy  imagine the lead of Thank You For Smoking but a surfer. I talked to a lot of other people but I dont remember the details.
 
The Google people are packing up the camping tents and mats. Tamara Munzner demoes some of her visualization software. She gave me and others a ride. Ezez Lieberman told me about his work modeling versions of evolution in which strucural forces cause random drift to tie with fitness selection and his wife Aviva Presser told me about her work investigating methilation in gene sequences.
 
It was an incredible conference. Probably the best Ive been to (although thats not saying much).

A couple of comments.  The actual percentage of women in attendance was 23%, according to my quick look at the semi-final confirmed attendee list as of a week before the event.  While many people will complain the number of women is still too low (I think it is), but compare to the male/female ratio in papers in Nature and Science, and youll likely find it reasonably comparable.
 
I also want to clarify the comment I made about Perl (which Ive made previously in public.)  First, the statement about Perl 6 being a performance art project was not made by me.  It was made by a leading Perl programmer (not associated with OReilly) who shall remain nameless unless he wants to step forward, maybe five years ago.   Second, I think some nuance was lost.  Whenever Ive made this point about Perl, Ive expressed it as a worry, not an affirmative statement.  That is, Ive worried that it was bad for Perl that I took Larry from situations in which he had a day job in which he had to wrestle with real-world problems, and had that to drive the development of the language, and put him into a situation where he could deal with the language in the abstract.  I dont actually know the answer to whether that worry is justified or not (although the long wait for Perl 6 may suggest that it is.)  When Ive talked about that in the past, Ive always added I wouldnt necessarily bet against Larry, because hes a real genius, and Perl has resurrected itself again and again in the past.
 
This does remain an open question.  Often constraints are important.  (This also came up in the talk by Pete Worden at Nasa, who said (in his session about earth colliding asteroid response) that we could do an asteroid mission in 12-18 months if we really had to, versus ten plus years if we didnt.  But he also said that the easiest way to do this is with a really long view, so you have time to nudge things rather than doing something potentially catastrophic.)  So the real question is the right balance.

Title: Consciousness Clarified
 
You ever notice how when you learn a new word you begin seeing it used everywhere? Lately Ive been feeling that way about consciousness. I knew the word before, obviously, but lately Ive clarified my thoughts about what it is and sloppy usage of the term sticks out like a sore thumb.
 
Consciousness, the dictionary kindly explains, is the state or condition of being conscious. And we all basically know what it means to be conscious. You poke someone awake and ask Are you conscious? You get hit on the head by a large rock and you get knocked unconscious. Being conscious, in short, means being awake, being aware of your surroundings, seeing colors and feeling pinches and hearing songs.
 
Now theres something weird about being conscious  something so weird, in fact, that Ive found many people are bizarrely tempted to deny it. Consciousness is what the philosopher John Searle calls ontologically subjective. That is, when you see the color red, while its true that all sorts of complicated things happen in your eyes and brains, a particular experience  the one we call seeing red  happens only to you. If aliens with the most powerful viewing technology possible beamed down to earth and peeked inside your brain, theyd still have no idea what the color red looked like. Theyd see that a certain wavelength of light triggered certain electrical impulses in certain centers, but theyd never see red. Its just not there.
 
Now we dont know for sure what causes consciousness (its an ongoing research project) but whatever the answer is, it must be caused by something. Yet this obvious fact is continually missed by laypeople who make bizarre comments like as soon as computers become self-aware, they might become conscious.1 This is as absurd as saying that as soon as computers are told about food, they might start digesting things.
 
Consciousness isnt some vague property of things that look smart to us. It has a real, physical meaning: feeling things. I suppose its logically possible that a talking robot might start feeling things, but the chances seem awfully remote.
 
Example: This weeks New York Times Magazine suggests a robot might exhibit the first glimmers of consciousness, namely, the reflexive ability of a mind to examine itself over its own shoulder.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

And not just laypeople: this is precisely the debate.
 
One side defines consciousness as the part of our minds which is not merely machine, thus by definition is something a computer could never have. The other side claims there is no such thing, that our entire experience of consciousness lies on the physical side of the mythical mind-body divide.
 
You seem to come down on the first side of this, by the usual method of stating that it is entirely obvious that consciousness is something else. You owe it to yourself to read Dennett, who I think at least makes it plausible to all that this need not be so.

p.s. I might add that I find the use of the word consciousness for any robot we could build soon about as idiotic as you do.

Have you been reading Nicholas Humphreys Seeing Red? He makes a big deal between the sensation of seeing red (redding, he sometimes calls it) and the perception of red. He has shown that some people with the usual bizarre kind of brain damage that these people love can perceive objects without the experience of seeing them (blindsight), so the two are different. He sees the evolutionary role of sensation as being to make us care about what we perceive - patients who can perceive without sensation tend not to make the effort to do so after a while.
 
Anyway, Im with you on the clarification thing, but with improbable on the something else thing - some of the time at least.

Aaron, please do yourself a favor and immediately start reading Douglas R. Hofstadters new book I Am a Strange Loop. It is the culmination of his decades of work exploring the nature of consciousness. The highly oversimplified version of his view is that consciousness arises from a representational systems of patterns, including a pattern of self and an ability to recursively cross levels of abstraction in these patterns.
 
Read the book already, its great.

Im not really sure what youre trying to say here. It is surely real and physical but since everything in our universe is real and physical, thats a tautology. When you get punched in the head, the physical changes in the fist, skin, skull and nerves cause physical changes in your brain which the illusion that is you interprets as pain and shock and so on.
 
Saying I feel pain is useful shorthand for describing the physical state of the universe, in particular: the cells in your brain are arranged and firing in some particular way. Nobodys going to argue with that, just as nobody argues that fist is a useful shorthand for describing the bundle of bones, tissues, and blood at the end of someones arm balled up in a certain way.
 
Since this shorthand concept consciousness seems to be an emergent property of a sufficiently-sophisticated agent whose model of the world includes both representations of others models and of its own, I would frankly be pretty surprised if a robot could ever be built that was honest-to-goodness intelligent, without its also being conscious. Then again I have a pretty high bar for intelligent (passing one Turing test doesnt cut it).

Or, maybe we just dont know enough about it yet. The conclusions that youre jumping to seem preposterous to me; why should we think that consciousness is ontologically subjective except for our own ignorance?
 
I for one expect consciousness to join planetary orbits and the origin of species in the list of great, formerly mysterious phenomena that we now understand. In the light of recent history, it seems like folly to say that anything is impossible to understand.
 
By the way, another concern I have with the views youve expressed previously is that they seem to imply that some special property of the universe was sitting around for fifteen billions years, waiting for us. Maybe that will turn out to be true, but it would be a reversal of the trend that weve seen in most major scientific discoveries.

Jamie,
 
Not everything that one might talk about is real and physical.  Real numbers, for instance, are neither real nor physical.  Yet we talk about them and describe their properties.  So Aarons statement is not tautological, though I think it is wrong for other reasons: A feeling is about as unreal and unphysical as something can get.
 
Also, wrt to your oblique assertion (a la Dennet) that consciousness is an illusion: This has always struck me as preposterous.  An illusion is what happens when ones senses are mislead into perceiving that which is not.  In other words, an illusion implies an observer.  So, you see, calling consciousness an illusion just begs the question.

Searle is right, consciousness is ontologically subjective.  That is its most important  characteristic.  Interesting that you picked up on it :)  This doesnt explain consciousness but it gives us a place to start.  The brain processes observed from the outside are not observed (felt) the same as when you are that brain.  Lots of processes are like that  even motion through space, which looks quite different if you the thing moving.  If you think about it that way, its not quite so surprising.

improbable: I think I provided a pretty clear idea of what consciousness was without excluding the possibility of computers having it. Dennetts position seems, like most of his positions, completely unreasonable.
 
Mark: We believe things are consciousness both because of what they do and because of the mechanism they use to do it. We know that dogs are conscious because we know they have similar brains to us. Similarly, if I call your telephone and make your telephone say Im conscious! I see red! you still wont think your telephone is conscious.
 
Jamie: In the section you quote, I wasnt trying to say that consciousness was a physical fact as opposed to taking place in some other dimension. I meant it was a thing like digestion as opposed to a vague notion like intelligence. People often treat conscious like intelligent: perhaps someday this computer will be intelligent is a reasonable statement; perhaps someday this computer will be conscious is not so much.
 
Jamie claims that Saying I feel pain is useful shorthand for describing  cells in your brain  firing in some particular way. This is close to the Dennett/behaviorist position and I find it completely bizarre. Its true that every time one feels pain, a certain set of cells in your brain are firing in a pattern, but the pain is caused by that firing, its not simply that firing. If you pinch yourself, you wont just cause some neurons to fire  youll feel a pain in your arm. I dont have patience to spell this out in more detail, but if you still dont believe me, I recommend reading Searles discussion of behaviorism in The Rediscovery of the Mind and, more briefly, in Mind: A Brief Introduction and, briefer still, in The Mystery of Consciousness.
 
Meanwhile, David claims that if we knew more, we wouldnt think of sight as ontologically subjective. Im not sure what David expects us to learn. I cant think of anything we could possibly find that would communicate to aliens what the experience of red is like. And theres certainly no evidence that any such magical thing exists  it seems pretty clear that our brains are neuron firings and the like.

We do?
 
Perhaps someday this computer will be intelligent is a reasonable statement; perhaps someday this computer will be conscious is not so much.
 
I dont see how you can say that until we thoroughly understand what consciousness is and what causes it! Consciousness is possible in this universe. But we dont know what causes it. So how can you be so sure that computers cant possess it?
 
I have no idea what we might learn. Neither do you. Keep an open mind. And after clarifying for us that experience is not the same as the neurological systems that cause the experience, I find your last statement pretty bizarre. Im not waiting for some whole new aspect of the universe to be revealed. Im just saying that the future hasnt happened until it happens.
 
Instead, wasnt it you who was saying that something physical about the brain itself causes consciousness? Your assertion that neurons can experience consciousness, but transistors or marbles* cannot, seems to imply an lan de conscience much more than anything I have said here.
 
By the way, when you email somebody your reply to them, you really should put it into second-person.

Why do you need to bring aliens into the picture? For the subjective experience you refer to as seeing red, other humans cant experience it either. Imagine aliens that have the technology to take human eyes and incorporate them into their own anatomies. Does that give them the ability to have the same subjective experience as humans?

None of this seems that hard to me. A mental model is a (necessarily very) abridged map of some collection of probabilities in time-space. Living creatures evolved to the point where they needed good mental models of not only their environment (to avoid the quicksand), not only the other creatures mental models (to guess what the lion is going to do next), but every human around them including themselves (to guess whos going to help or screw over whom). Just as the creatures are benefited by sensing pain, they are benefited by sensing that they are a continually-existing singular conscious entity moving forward in time. It seems clear that this belief in our own consciousness is an evolutionary advantage in a socially-rich environment of long-lived agents: my ancestors without it probably couldnt have been as concerned about making long-term goals with the aim of survival and reproduction.
 
Its hard to have a fair discussion about this. Every response to this thread has talked about I, we, you, which presuppose there is something real and physical about the referents of those pronouns. Just as pi refers to the concept of a ratio of an ideal circles circumference to its diameter and does not actually exist in our universe, I refers to a very complex collection of symbol-manipulating mental models being run like a tinkertoy computer by the physical matter inside my skull. Its shorthand that we cant really live without because we are these things. Pi is an emergent property of elementary geometry, and I am an emergent property of physics. Once we all agree on that point we can start having a meaningful conversation about consciousness.
 
Ill put the Searle books on my reading list, but I doubt Ill be all that impressed; the Chinese room thought-experiment is founded on a severe, I would say laughable, misunderstanding of the relationship between brains and minds. My reaction to reading about it for the first time was surely this isnt what passes for philosophy about the mind nowadays, its so stupid and so Ive never been interested in reading more Searle. (I think I first read of it in The Minds I; I would have been 11 or 12.)

Aaron,
 
if seeing red is something more than neurons firing, then why is that my patient last week with a stroke in the occipital lobe cant see in an as yet not entirely defined region of his visual field? He was alert and oriented to time person and place and has no evidence of pathology between from the film of tear overlaying his eye all the way back through the optic nerve, the optic chiasm, the radiations, and into the occipital lobe?
 
The information isnt being processed. What is not being informed? His soul? His consciousness? Wernickes area is still intact: he has the word red. Brocas area is intact: he can construct sentences and use the word red appropriately. The biological deficit is in a part of the brain further from the eye, logically, than the banks of the calcarine sulcus, specifically a huge area of white matter in the occipital lobe.
 
The biological its neurons model has proven better than any other model, since Cahal, in explaining psychiatric and neurologic illnesses (like strokes that involve virtually every element of consciousness) and the effectiveness of treatments that are used. It explains the stages of development. It is more thoroughly tested than any other model and has held up to innumerable experiments.
 
If you maintain that red is not in the neurons, you will need to explain why hormones and psychoactive chemicals effect thought processes, explain the repetitive pattern of thought changes that follow spatially similar strokes. You will need to explain color blindness. And you will need to advance an alternative explanation.
 
I think, if anything, the word is misleading. Like Open Source software, conciousness is an umbrella term of convenience, its scope makes it inherently resistant to testable definition.

Jamie accurately points out that living creatures need[] good mental models of their environment, themselves, and others. But then he says this amounts simply in a belief in our own consciousness. I tried to show that consciousness isnt simply a belief, its a real physical process that has to be addressed.
 
And, for what its worth, those Searle books are vastly superior to the Chinese Room, which Searle never saw as fit enough to publish in a real book (my sense is that hes a tad embarrassed of it).

Of course not. Human eyes just convert light into electrical impulses,
like web cams. Plugging a web cam into a computer doesnt give it any

Title: Fear and Loathing: A Correction
 
The other week in a post titled Fear and Loathing in Biotechnology Firms, I wrote:
 
Hey there! said the scientist. Hi, said the bored-looking African-American woman behind the desk.
 
In response, I recently received the following comment from a poster who goes by the name I WAS THERE THAT NIGHT:
 
Im not a large african american woman, and there was no desk. Your facts are incorrect, and you looked very very scared that night, my friend.
 
Id like to take this moment to correct the record. Upon reflection, security sat behind a barrier that was indeed tall enough to make it a counter and not a desk. We at Raw Thought deplore the casual use of language that causes many speakers to conflate counters with desks and we strive for precision in these matters. We deeply regret the error.
 
Id also like to take this moment to correct another error. The same article suggests the same so-called desk was reached after ducking into a door. After a further review of notes by the author, we have concluded that it was not actually a door, but more of a small hallway leading to several doors, really a kind of alcove actually.
 
I hope this post underscores our commitment to facts at Raw Thought. We continue to stand by our claims that journalists noses look bigger while on drugs, that giant vats of transgenic corn cure cancer, that CostCo is authentically historic, and that Genentech is the Best Company to Work For in America. We can only hope that its employees continue to read our quality content.

Title: Announcing the Open Library
 
Early this year, when I left my job at Wired Digital, I thought I could look forward to months of lounging around San Francisco, reading books on the beach and drinking fine champagne and eating foie gras. Then I got a phone call. Brewster Kahle of the Internet Archive was thinking of pursuing a project that Id been trying to do literally for years. I thought long and hard about it and realized I couldnt pass this opportunity up. So I put aside my dreams of lavish living and once again threw myself into my work. Just as well, I suppose, since San Franciscos beaches are freezing cold, champagne has a disgusting taste, and foie gras is even worse.
 
I thought of the smartest programmers and designers I knew and gave them a ring, sat down for coffee with them, threatened to fly out to their homes and knock on their doors. In the end, we got together an amazing group of people  all sworn to secrecy of course  and in the past few months weve put together whats probably the biggest project I ever worked on.
 
So today Im extraordinarily proud to announce the Open Library project. Our goal is to build the worlds greatest library, then put it up on the Internet free for all to use and edit. Books are the place you go when you have something you want to share with the world  our planets cultural legacy. And never has there been a bigger attempt to bring them all together.
 
I hope youll take a look and let me know what you think. And if this project excites you the way it excites me, I hope youll join us.

I like it. Markdown looks simple enough that writers will use it for their ordinary work, which can then be formated as they wish. HTML is a bit awkward for that.
 
Two suggestions to think about:
 
Some Guides, like Popularity, could come directly from usage. Other Guides could be run by organizations, such as scholarly societies, philosophical groups, political parties, corporations, or governments  whoever runs it would control the content of that Guide. Anyone could set up a new Guide, though only a limited number would get enough momentum to be widely useful, by having credible recommendations on many of the books in their field. Each Guide might appear to the end user as a personality (think of spirit guides), though almost always a Guide will be a group creation.
 
Hopefully 3rd-party sponsors will buy hundreds of prepaid free downloads at a time, because they like the book, like the author, like the movement or cause  and/or want to send their own short message or ad targeted to people anywhere who like them. Note that the click fraud problem largely disappears with this kind of targeted ad.

Title: Fear and Loathing in Biotechnology Firms
 
I was sitting with my journalist and reading Fear and Loathing when I noticed that things werent seeming the way Id become accustomed to them seeming. For one thing, my journalists nose seemed a fair sight bigger than one would expect a nose to be, even accounting for taste, while her eyes seemed to be moving back and forth in her head as if they werent quite sure whether they preferred it in or out.
 
Still, I shouldnt criticize. I suspect I didnt look my usual self either, what with my head making those small wobbly notions on my neck and my leg vibrating back and forth as if it were thinking very hard about something. Why it was forced to work as my leg, supporting me all the time while i gave it no consideration in return, perhaps.
 
As I finished the book I slammed it down on the desk, causing a couple other books to fall off the side. We must rent a very fast car, I demanded, before scrunching up my face in an inevitably doomed attempt to get a look at myself. I didnt normally sound like this.
 
My journalist agreed, so we popped some pills and picked up a BMW. It was a little past midnight at the time, so you could hardly notice the cars nasty habit of accelerating right up to the edge of other cars, stopping hard a couple inches before it hit them.
 
We must find a heart of darkness, said my journalist. I just looked at her. She continued mumbling about a heart of darkness while stepping on the accelerator. I decided to look away. She continued to make friends with the accelerator. Ive got it she shouted, wrenching the car around, Vacaville!
 
My journalist assured me that Vacaville was a small city outside San Francisco filled with giant vats of transgenic mutant corn that cured cancer. I wasnt quite sure what any of that really was, let alone which part of that was a heart of darkness. My fears were not allayed when we pulled off the freeway under a giant light-up sign that said Authentic Historic Vacaville, only to see a couple 7-11s and a CostCo. We got back on the freeway.
 
The next time we got off the freeway, there were a dozen industrial buildings with sinister yellow lighting belching vast plumes of smoke into the air. We ditched the car behind a tree, dropped our wallets and identification in it, and, arm-in-arm, begun strolling through a place which had even less claim to the title of Authentic Historic Vacaville.
 
In 2006, the leading biotechnology firm Genentech was named the number one Best Company To Work For by Fortune Magazine. I suppose this incredible allure could explain why the companys campus was surrounded by barbed wire. It did not, however, explain why the barbed wire was facing in.
 
There are a couple of ways to get into the Genentech campus. You can climb the barbed wire fence. You can swipe an ID badge and go through the imposing metal turnstiles. You can drive past the guard at the main gate and show some kind of ID. Or you can find the side gate that they forgot to lock and open it. My journalist didnt want to scratch her pants, so we used the side gate.
 
And that was how we found ourselves strolling in the moonlight around the factories of a leading biotechnology firm.
 
This place is incredible, my journalist said, as we approached it. Construction worker, I said, as I spotted a man walking through the corridors of the empty new building. We continued walking around it.
 
Im always morally torn by major biotech companies, she explained. Smoke break, I said, as the construction worker stepped outside the building and paused.
 
On the one hand, this place makes drugs that save peoples lives  treatments for cancers and cystic fibrosis and asthma, she told me. Heading out, I told her, as the construction worker walked across the campus towards the gate.
 
And yet, on the other hand, this place is pure evil. We walked past large vats labeled Poison and huge machines that looked like they could crush us. Smoke belched from the top of the building and we could see more buildings and a parking lot in the distance.
 
Companies like this are made up of dozens of people, each of whom, individually, are the sweetest guys. Nice, friendly people who just care about doing well at their work. As we approached the buildings, we saw that even now  2AM  the place was alive. New cars were pulling into the lot and men and women were walking from building to building. The yellowed light on their white lab coats gave the whole thing a sinister air.
 
And yet, together, they manage to pull off the most incomprehensible evils. I was about to join her discussion of organizational sociology when I heard a go-kart pull up behind us.
 
Excuse me, said the man in the go-kart. Do you folks work here?
 
I was about to come up with some explanation but my journalist dodged in front of me and saved me the trouble.
 
No, sir, she said, with complete sincerity.
 
Do you have visitors badges? asked the man, sounding a bit puzzled.
 
Definitely not, she said.
 
Are you supposed to be here?
 
No way. Actually, we were just going for a stroll when we found ourselves in this bizarre place. We were wondering if you could tell us how to get out.
 
The man in the go-kart thought about this for a while before getting out of the kart and walking towards us. As he stepped into the light I could see he was wearing a bright orange vest.
 
Huh, well the fastest way to get out of the facility from here is probably to walk through the entire campus, he explained.
 
Oh, I see, said the journalist. Well, could you escort us off the premises then? she asked. I restrained myself from kicking her.
 
The man in the vest looked back at the go-kart, where his partner was sitting. Nah, my theres no more room in the kart, he said.
 
Oh, well then maybe you could take us to security? she said. I dug a small hole in the ground, placed my foot into it, then used the other foot to fill it back up with dirt in a vain attempt to stop myself from kicking her.
 
Im actually not allowed to take you guys to Genentech security, he said. See, Im over with construction. One of my men came by and told me that he saw to people walking around the premises, so I just came to check it out. He thought about this for a while. Let me see if I can find you someone, he said.
 
And that is how we got a burly man in a bright orange vest to escort us onto the Genetech campus, a series of industrial buildings facing a shared quadrangle of matted grass, with some concrete sidewalks laid across it. The whole thing looked a bit like a college campus, I suppose, if the colleges buildings had been designed to look like some kind of sci-fi bubble city. Through the windows one could spy huge machines with many levers dials and large vats that stuff was being oozed into and out of.
 
People entered and exited the buildings in a hurried manner, and one scientist, a frazzled-looking man with a redheads beard and an orange t-shirt reading got juice?, crossed the path in front of us.
 
Excuse me, said the man in the vest, his manly striding posture suddenly becoming bowed and deferential before the frazzled scientist. I found these people who got lost wandering around the campus, he explained, as if it was a question. Do you think you could try to get them home?
 
Oh, sure! said the scientist, genial and alive as a carnival barker, as if he made a habit of wandering around the Genentech campus at 2 in the morning looking for people to take back to their cars.
 
Thanks so much, said the man in the vest, before scurrying back to his go-kart.
 
The scientist reached for a walkie-talkie from his back pocket. Security, are you there? Security? he said and paused. The radio crackled. This is security, it finally replied. Where are you? he asked. There was a pause. Then a crackle. What?
 
Are you in your office? Pause, crackle. Um, yeah.
 
OK, be there in a bit.
 
And that was how a Genentech scientist badged us into the facility and begun taking us through its corridors.
 
So what do you do here? I asked, as if making conversation.
 
Oh, we, um, make drugs to treat breast cancer, he explained.
 
Yeah, right, my journalist whispered in my ear. Awful big facility just for treating breast cancer.
 
What do you do? I asked. Oh, Im a scientist here.
 
Oh, really? A scientist? Heh, I always imagined scientists wandering around in big white labcoats carrying beakers, I joked. Oh, we do, he said with utter sincerity. Actually, I just took my lab coat off  if you guys had been here a couple minutes earlier I would have been wearing it.
 
We wandered past hallways labeled with Genentech propaganda and stopped right before the company cafeteria, ducking into a door to find the desk for security.
 
Hey there! said the scientist. Hi, said the bored-looking African-American woman behind the desk.
 
Um, these two folks got a bit lost wandering around the neighborhood and I was wondering you could help get them out of here.
 
The security womans eyes widened. What? she shouted. You brought random strangers in here? They cant be in here! You cant just bring people in here!
 
Well, I just figured I ought to take them to security and you guys could help them out.
 
Help them out? Help them out? Im not allowed to leave this desk, she cried. Oh, they cant be in here. You gotta get rid of these guys.
 
Oh, okay, said the scientist, completely unfazed. Well, Ill walk them back to their car.
 
Yeah, whatever, she said dismissively. You just do what you gotta do, cause they cant be in here.
 
And that was how a Genentech scientist took us through the building, past offices, through the loading dock, out the back past more industrial equipment, a running commentary all the way.
 
Howd you guys get in here? asked the guard at the gate as we walked past him. Hed obviously heard about us. Oh, my journalist said, it was open. We just walked in. The guard just laughed and waved.
 
The scientist asked where we were from, just in the spirit of making conversation. My journalist explained that we were from San Francisco and wed decided it was a nice night for a casual stroll, so we had been walking around Vacaville. The scientist nodded approvingly, as if he always ran into cityfolk who came out for a stroll around Vacavilles office parks at 2 in the morning.
 
Soon wed located our car and said our goodbyes. The scientist waved goodbye at us and we tried to stifle our giggles until we got back to the car.
 
At moments like these, which seem to stand outside of space and time  middle of nowhere, middle of the night  one thing remains constant: Dennys. Always open, with decor that hasnt changed since its founding in the 1960s, a diner like Dennys is a perfect place to go to make sense of it all. But none of it makes any sense at all; there is nothing to do but lay your head down on the table and puzzle at a world that is more strange than you can possibly imagine.

This tries to be funny, but I found it difficult to laugh.  Between the lines I saw an ugly ooze of prejudice that turned my stomach.  But dont worry folks, its ok. Its hip prejudiceprejudice against pharmaceutical companies.  It used to be equally hip to be prejudiced against gays and african-americans.
 
Ok, there is one funny partclearly the author has no concept of what Genentech is.  Its actually one of the last pharma companies you would characterize negatively.  The people there go to work every day, thrilled to be saving lives and improving the world.  Sure, lets criticize that.

Wow wow wee.  Why dont you schedule a meeting with Genentechs PR and ask to take a tour?  Why dont you interview the patients that survived from the cancers they beat using Genentechs medications before you and your journalist make assumptions?
 
And yet, together, they manage to pull off the most incomprehensible evils.really? The incomprehensible evils produced from the Vacaville site are the foosball players. Im serious, they are wickedly good.  There is one player from there that has this pull shot. Its so good that he said he sold his soul to the devil to acquire the shot.  And theres this other guy with a sinister bank shot. His 5 man bank shot can be classified as  a huge machine(s) that looked like they could crush us.
In the end, we can safely concur with Helen Momma Boucher, Foosball is the devil!

How can you say that biotech is evil without any explanation?  You offer no proof, no evidence, nothing at all to back up your claim.  Are they evil for making cancer curing drugs?  Are they evil in the way they escorted you through the building?  I dont follow you at all.  You simply say that biotech in evil, which is an unsubstatiated opinion.  I can do what you do:
 
Milk is evil.
Chair is evil.
Lamp is evil.

I work at said biotech firm and you have a lot more facts that are outright lies.  There are no vats that are labeled poison, there is no inward facing barbed wiresure there is a fence and security, its a facility that costs half a billion dollars and corporate espionage has actually happened in this industry.  Secondly you are extremely lucky you didnt get arrested for trespassing on private property.  Thirdly, check out Genentechs philanthropic endeavors.  Also note that were an extremely liberal company who emphasizes social and racial equality.  Were rated one of the best companies for working mothers, even offering onsite day care to employees needing such services.  Youre shortsighted and illegal adventure is not only a lie but also moronic and childish at best.

The things that is so doing my head in, lovely people from Genentech, is that you were all lovely. Aaron made a point of it, as well. Maybe you thought of it as sarcastic, but it wasnt at all. Even the ones that really were annoyed were lovely, and the man who took time out to help us was amazing. Individually, I doubt there was anyone there that wouldnt have ripped out their own beating heart to help someone in need. And you all were happy, well treated, etc. The heavenliness of it was part of what made it so intense and, to some degree, distressing.
 
Pharma companies like Genentech make drugs that have personally saved my life. Thats where my ambivalence comes from- for every me there are a bunch of people in the world that dont get treated due to business decisions, logistics, etc. Theres a myriad of ways it comes about, and subtle critiques of why it happens, but Im left with that human moment of knowing how it feels to be sick and without hope. The pharma angel descended on me. Maybe its the survivors guilt, maybe its the belief that we could collectively do better, but it leaves me heartsick.
 
So how does it happen? How do oil companies keep the world going and destroy the climate all at once? How do people as nice and generous as you add up to doing horrible as well as wonderful things? Why does it seem like sometime you can add more lovely people and end up with more terrible acts? And what, if anything, can we do about it? Its like a mythical man month of morality.
 
So there was fear, we were scared out of our wits at times. And there was loathing, for, like you, ultimately being in the middle of this thing we dont understand and cant get out of. And like you, were basically good people that get misunderstood sometimes.
 
There are huge vats labeled poison. I believe its required by law on corrosives.
 
(The barbed wire facing in comment was actually a miscommunication. That was my high school in LA, not the Genentech campus.)

Sure we make profits, were a company in a capitalist system.  Thats how we survive.  The expenses the public sees is from the raw material used to create the life altering drugs.  You look at one component and see that it costs us over five hundred dollars and we must use fifteen of them every other day and then throw them away after one use and you wonder why we charge so much?  Furthermore what is the price of human life?  If were such an evil organization bent on milking the world, then why would anyone take our products?  The reason is that they save lives.  They stop cancer from growing and they work.  If you really think were so evil and even have the audacity to compare us to oil companies who have nine billion dollars in profit each quarter for a product with inelastic demand, then honestly you dont care about the peoples fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters that we have helped live longer lives.  You honestly dont care about the humans who live to breath another day, who enrich their familys life another minute.  The problem with liberal politics (coming from a democrat this sounds funny) is there shortsightedness.  You see only what we charge, but you never attempt to place, or you do with fleeting desire, your minds around the costs to bring these products to market and their ultimate effects.  Our biggest dreams are to be able to go out of business.  To be able to eradicate cancer, but seeing as how cancer is in fact your very own body with mutated DNA, the chances of that happening are slim.  So we are dedicated to the treatment of such a disease and the ability to give a dying person more time with their families, possibly even a lifetime more.  In short, you two and your ilk are the real evil, the real enemies of the millions of people who are dying out there.

Please understand my point of view; the entire medical field doesnt save even a significant fraction of the lives evil oil companies save.
 
If they stopped, it would all shut down, the lights would go out, and wed die. Wed end up eating each other in darkened besieged streets if oil companies didnt aggressively, sociopathically, seek out their product, take it from whoever is on top of it, and get it to market efficiently. Id like to think I boycott Exxon, but of course I dont. If I owe Pfizer my life 5 times over, I owe Exxon my life 1000 times over.
 
That leaves me ambivalent. If you look at the time stamp on this post, youll see it leaves me ambivalent late into the night.
 
You say yours is a company doing what it has to to survive in a capitalist system; that is what I was saying. We are interdependent. We rely on companies like Genentech to make us drugs, you rely on us waving our insurance cards indiscriminately when we feel bad. Ideologies aside, however evil you may think we are, youre still going to take our money, and our insurance companys money. Were still going to take your drugs. I think we can all agree insurance companies are evil, but again, Id be dead and youd be unemployed without them. None of us are ready to defect from this system.
 
I think its hard to find evil. Every time you try to nail it down, everything gets hopelessly complex. I think this is kind of what the banality was about. Its not the Jack the Rippers of history that do great evil, its not even the bad leaders. The bad men of history never killed millions of people, they created systems, and then ordered the system to go do it. I dont think Genentech is a system expressly designed for killing people, and I dont think I am either.
 
I think Genentech is part of a system that moves independent of the morality of the people within it. I think I left that night with a much greater awareness of a fairly simple thing. I came to look at that system, and like the campus itself, suddenly found myself in the middle of it.

Just a couple of things to say here (most of its already been said)First off, wild, random Thompsonesque behavior is great fun (albeit at someone elses expense) and as a fan of Hunter S. Thompson, and even Kerouac Ive pushed the limits of decency and reason.  Where Ive drawn the line is the at someone elses expensepart.  One of the security guards lost their job that night.  Thats right, because of your behavior.  Maybe he deserved it.  Maybe he was evil.  So, while you debate with the others on this blog (very wittily, I might add) about the dichotomy of life and its relationship with good and evil, YOU COST A MAN HIS JOB.
 
By the way Journalist, this duality of man subject has been argued to death by every intellectual or psuedo-intellectual since man has existed.  Plato, Aristotle, Nietzche, and yes Thompson, just to name a few.  Its getting old my friend.  Take a lesson from the oldest civilization on earth, the Chinese.  Its called Yin and Yang.  It is what it is, and harmony is only found when you embrace it.  If you really want to helpquit your job, move to the Arizona desert, build an earthship, and live the dream.  Otherwise, grow up and understand the consequences of your actions:  Yin = you storming the Genentech campus. Yang = Hard working provider to his family loses his job.  Theres good and evil for ya.

Title: Real Good Books
 
So I was sitting there, reading Natalie Angiers The Canon and complaining to my roommate. God, this book is so overwritten, I whined. This is the worst science book since Lauren Slater published Opening Skinners Box. I read her a random sentence: Am I sounding a self-pitying, sour-grapes-turned-defensive whine? Of course: a good offense begins with a nasal defensiveness. I was about to read more when she stopped me. If that book is so bad, she asked, why do you keep reading it?
 
And so, we decided on a plan: for the month of June, I would only read good books. Unfortunately, this plan didnt go as well as I had hoped  good books are harder to find that it might seem at first. I realized what I really wanted was books that were compulsively readable, the kind that once you slurped down like wet noodles, where once you started in on them you just couldnt stop.
 
Ive read a couple books like that, but not many. For example, David Boies autobiography isnt the kind of thing I would normally pick up. Self-aggrandizing autobiographies arent exactly my thing and Boies, while interesting, isnt exactly a topic of fascination for me. But when I found myself holding it with a couple minutes to kill, I started reading it and before I noticed it I was most of the way through the 500 page book.
 
Or take James Wolcotts Attack Poodles. Now I love a good media-bashing as much as the next guy, but this one I just couldnt put down. I had to sneak away from dinner to finish reading it. And when it was done, I found myself wanting more.
 
What both books have in common, aside from being fun reads, is a small red rectangle on in the upper left of their covers. The rectangle is part of the Miramax Books logo which stretches from the back cover around the spine to the front of every book they publish. As far as I know, Miramax is the only publisher audacious enough to put their logo on the cover of their books, and while I initially took it as a sign of Hollywood arrogance, I now see it as something else: a mark of quality. Perhaps, I figured, Miramax works so hard to make their books readable that they want to capitalize on that brand by making it really clear which ones were theirs. I even dreamed of having my books published by Miramax.
 
So when my plan for June fizzled out, I tried to think of how I could fix things for July. And I hit upon the idea of spending it only reading Miramax books. Unfortunately for me, when the Weinstein Brothers (who ran Miramax) left Disney, Miramax Books got the axe. The Weinstein Brothers have restarted their book division at their new company (cleverly named The Weinstein Company, apparently because Fellowship Adventure Group was too gay) but their first real book doesnt come out until September.
 
So heres a plea to you readers: where does one find compulsively readable books? Who do you trust?

I have no idea where to find such books, but Ill tell you some I have found (although it is mostly fiction):
 
At the moment I am devouring David Brin and Salmon Rushdie.
 
Richard Dawkins is one of those people who is so eloquent that its all too easy not to think about what hes saying. I recommend /The Ancestors Tale/ for a tour of coolities in zoology.
 
Neal Stephensons /Baroque Cycle/ took me a couple of months to get through, and I didnt want it to end.
 
/A History of Mathematics/ by Victor Katz has been good so far. /e: the Story of a Number/ was delightful when I read it, though it might be boring if you already know calculus.
 
Richard Feynman, obviously.
 
/This Boys Life/ by Tobias Wolff, which is a memoir, which, from what I gather, means an autobiography that reads like a novel.
 
/What Mad Pursuit/ by Francis Crick was alright.

Anything by Rachel Carson.  Silent Spring is something everyone should read just because of its historical importance, although its somewhat dated as a piece of science writing.  But her other three major books, especially the Sea Around Us, are amazing and hold up very well.  Id say Carson was the best writer Ive read.
 
As for autobiographies, E. O. Wilsons Naturalist and Watsons The Double Helix are must-reads.

There are so many good books, so you have to choose efficiently. Here is a method: decide based on the first page. If you cant decide, thats a no. You can read a lot of first pages very quickly, right there in the library. You dont have to be too selective, because what ultimately grabs you may be a surprise.

I think lots of other publishers put their logos on the covers of their books, at least in fiction.  Penguin and Vintage definitely do.  Do you read much fiction?
 
If so, T.C. Boyle writes books that I cant put down, as does Nadine Gordimer.  I also thought The Russian Debutantes Handbook was pretty funny.

I read over a hundred and twenty books in 2006. Some of them were OK. Some were good. Some were very good. Here are the handful that I can recommend you read without any reservations.

Im surprised you liked Against Love. I was thrilled when I found out about it, since Im very sympathetic to the cause, but I was terribly disappointed when I read it - I found it lacking in substance, and the Kipnis tone ranging from whiny to drunken. Someone should write a better book about this subject. Still, kudus to Kipnis for daring, I suppose.

Might I recommend the fiction of RIchard Powers? The Goldbug Variation from 1991 is amazing, read it twice to make sure it stuck, goes deep into what a crazy molecule DNA really is, into the ramifications of how genetics forces upon us certain behavioural traits. The latest one, the Echo Maker, instead explores the brain and how much can go wrong with it. All within the context of very real characters and their personal histories. Amazing stuff.

Title: That Vision Thing
 
Ironically enough, I remember the moment clearly. It was about five
years ago now, when I looked up from the car and realized I couldnt
see. I had been staring at my computer a lot, and reading books when I
wasnt doing that, so I didnt notice much, but that day, riding in the
car, I looked up and realized I couldnt read the street sign. I
definitely used to be able to read that sign, but there it was, big and
bright and green along the highway, and all I could make out was a blur.
I had gone blind.
 
Legally blind, as I learned yesterday. My vision is below the legal
threshold in the US for legal blindness. (Far below, as far as I can
tell, but the eye exam chart doesnt really make fine-grained
distinctions at that level.) And yet, for five years, this never really
bothered me. I never wore glasses for more than an hour, I squinted hard
enough to pass the vision test at the DMV, I sat close to blackboards
and listened carefully.
 
I tried a couple things to improve my eyesight, but nothing very
seriously. I tried, but it never seemed important enough to warrant the
effort. And so I walked thru life, legally blind. I didnt really
notice.
 
My roommate, Quinn, has been nagging me about this. She wants me to get
LASIK, I think largely because it involves lasers. But finally the other
day I took some action and went to the optometrist.
 
You know those eye charts you see sometimes? The ones that famously
start with E at the top and then the letters get smaller and smaller? I
couldnt read the E. When I looked up at it, all I saw was a vague blur.
So they gave me contacts.
 
Contacts are an odd thing. Theyre almost invisible, malleable little
things that you cant see once theyre stuck on your eye. One minute,
youre living a Monet-like existence of a world blurred, then tap your
eye and suddenly, invisibly, everything is clear.
 
I had no idea the world really looked like this, with such infinite
clarity. It looks like a modernist photo or a hyperreal film, everything
in focus everywhere. Everyone kept saying oh, do you see the leaves
now? but the first thing I saw was not the leaves but the people.
People, individuated, each with brilliant faces and expressions at
gaits, the sun streaming down upon them. I couldnt help but smile. Its
much harder being a misanthrope when you can see peoples faces.
 
Then came the signs, the signs with messages I could read from a
distance. No longer would I have to carefully count my stops on the
subway because I couldnt read the station signs. And then the
buildings, their edges no longer fuzzy like clouds but hard and harsh
and magnificent.
 
I no longer feared myself, formerly this vague visage in the mirror that
I had to look away from. Now in the mirror I could see my face, and even
thought it looked good.
 
The resolution on my cameraphone suddenly seems insufficient. The crumbs
and dirt in our apartment that previously drove my roommate crazy are
now visible enough to drive me crazy too. I can look people in the eye
and smile and see them smile back. I can see the contours of their
faces. When I look up at night I can see the things in my room, even
when the lights are off.
 
My eyes are open and I can now experience the beauty thats been more
than a few feet in front of my nose.

I hear you, Aaron. The clarity of the world immediately after I upgrade my glasses prescription always astounds me, and the first one was a huge shock.
 
I was in a similar position as you, and I didnt get glasses for years until after I needed them, but I really liked the impressionistic effect of being partially blind and seeing everything in blur. Ive worn glasses now for about 10 years, but I still like to walk around without them on sometimes and experience the world in blurs and soft edges, without the extraneous details and the hard, sharp boundaries of the objects of the world.

This is awesome!  I can clearly remember getting my first pair of glasses when I was about 11 and the shock of being able to see anything in any detail.  It was also extremely interesting going through a phase of correlating the individual blurs that different people were - so thats what Jeremy looks like
Its wonderful to have clear vision (even if it has to be upgraded every few years).

You should consider LASIK, its one of the best things Ive done. I loved contacts, but its nice to have perfect eyesight all the time. You lose the morning / evening ritual, and if you live your life with very irregular hours like me, your contacts wont get uncomfortable after wearing them 16 hours.
 
Besides, its one of the more surreal experiences you can have - youre awake, with eyes wide open. High precision machinery swoops down on your eye, peels your cornea away, and attacks it with beepy lasers. You can see your field of vision getting clearer bit by bit. To some, that sounds like the worse thing ever, but I got a kick out of it.

ha.. I went through sort of the same experience. I was having trouble reading fine print, so I got an eye exam. The optometrist said didnt anyone ever give you a vision screening before? I said sure, plenty of times, I had them annually when I was a kid. He said did anyone ever diagnose you as dyslexic? I said yes. He said well youve been farsighted ever since you were little. Its not surprising that nobody caught it, the usual tests are for screening farsightedness. Youre not dyslexic, your eyes just have a hard time focusing at the distance youd read a book. So I got eyeglasses, at the age of 40.
At the time, I had gone back to school to finish my art degree. I was taking painting classes. The teacher asked me what happened to me, he said I was suddenly painting with more vibrant colors, and my whole style changed. I just said, well I started wearing glasses and now I can see what Im doing.

Interesting is the first word that comes to mind! Pretty much reminds me of my own path to contact lenses. It was much like you described, for years I had no idea that I even needed any glasses! I used to get headaches and a bit of watering in my eyes but could mostly get by without too much discomfort. And when I paid a visit to the ophthalmologist, whaam! -2.25! Now, of course, its -5.5 and stable, thanks to contact lenses.
I loved the way you expressed your first view through the contact lenses. Very similar to what I had felt. Good for you mate.

Your roommate and a poster are all for you having Lasik, but if you do consider laser eye surgery remember the operative word: surgery. Its easy to forget that Lasik is serious business and not every Lasik surgeon graduated at the top the class.
 
I work with a nonprofit Lasik patient advocacy. We dont provide Lasik; we evaluate and certify Lasik doctors based upon patient outcomes. We also publish the 50 Tough Questions For Your Lasik Doctor to help evaluate any potential Lasik surgeon. Our website is full of objective information and we host a patient forum where you can converse with others.
 
Now that you know what you have with contacts you may want to have it with Lasik. Pick the best available doctor and do your own research. Dont go into Lasik blind (pun fully intended).

Its simply amazing youve gotten this far, being blind.  I remember the first time I got my vision checked.  At 18 I could finally see.  What did it for me that first night was looking at the street lamps half a mile away.  No more blurriness and shiny lines that made every spot of light look like a drawing of a star done by a 7 yr old.  Every light was just that, a simple and pure point of light.  Hoorah for clarity!

Title: Discrimination and Causation
 
First, lets imagine that tomorrow scientists announced the discovery of rock-solid, unimpeachable, 100% convincing evidence of differences in mental function between men and women. Lets say, for example, they notice that theres a tiny hole where the math center of the brain should be. No wonder they do worse at math!
 
No doubt, The Times would respond with a handwringing article about the important scientific implications and David Brooks would throw a party and denounce closed-minded liberals. George Bush would cancel programs aimed at helping girls learn math and Harvard University would shut down their task force on getting women tenure.
 
But are these really appropriate responses? Showing genetic differences is only the first in a long line of things that need to be shown to prove that gender-based disparities in tenure are unavoidable. As Jeremy Freese has pointed out, its a long line from genes to social outcomes. To make the case, you need to go a lot further.
 
Second, you have to show the genetic differences are relevant. Its possible the hole in the math center could be completely insignificant, that women do just as well at math irrespective. So you need to show that the hole causes differences in functioning. One way to do this is to find different people with differing sizes of holes, control for as many other factors as possible, and see if the size of hole is correlated with some test of math functioning.
 
Third, you need to prove that the differences are unavoidable. The brain has amazing levels of neuroplasticity. Perhaps with the right environment, women can be taught to do math with another part of their brain. Perhaps, as a result, they might even do better than men at math. Again, Freese has pointed out that the same genetic differences (or genetic similarities) can go all sorts of different places in different environments. If theres an easy environmental change that makes even genetically different women equally good at math, we ought to make it.
 
Fourth, you need to show a causal link from the genetic difference to the tenure disparity. Why is it that doing worse at math causes you to do worse at tenure? Are speed-math-tests used as a relevant factor in tenure decisions? If so, maybe you guys should really cut that out, because thats a pretty stupid test.
 
Fifth, you need to show that its the only cause of discrimination. Even if genetic differences cause some of the disparity, its still morally required for us to remove the rest. Do guys with holes in their math center do just as bad as women at getting tenure? Do women with no holes do just as well as men?
 
Right now, theres only even arguable evidence for the very first of these. Those of us who want to shove discrimination under the rug need to do a lot more work on the other four.

But are these really appropriate responses?
 
No. We all know plenty of women who are good at math.
 
Given a mental task X that a man is good at, youll likely find a woman who is good at it as well.  This we simply know from experience.

Yes. And given a tall person, you can almost certainly find a short person who could beat that tall person at basketball. A correlation doesnt have to be 100% to be valid  and as far as I know, there isnt even a correlation between mathematical talent and gender. There is a correlation between variance in talent and gender: men are (as demonstrated by standardized test scores and subsequent careers) more likely to be really good or really bad, and similarly less likely to be average. Could be cultural, could be genetic, could be random  but thats only really important if you want to fix it, rather than just wanting to know it. And if you want to fix it, Id like to know why.
 
The higher standard deviation means that for accomplishments that require the top fraction of a percentile, men will be overwhelmingly dominant even though the average man isnt better at math than the average woman.

Aaron, as you see from Byrnes response - not to mention The Bell Curve - you are dealing with rationalization, not rationality.

Before someone get huffy, I should note the refution of the above statistical argument, which granted is a bit subtle: The problem is that it relies on a simplistic statistical model in exactly the range where that model is least reliable - which, rationally, should at least give pause regarding how correct an explation it is.
 
The deep problem is that Ive never seen anyone who advanced that argument then say, Yknow, you have a really good point there. All models are provisional, and I never realized there was a subtle flaw in my statistics there. Its always something like No! The model says! Its just natural, men get to be in overwhelmingly in the top spots, science proves it!. This is why a certain type of liberal comes to hate science - I strongly disagree with them on their anti-science views, but I sure understand where they are coming from.

It could be that standardized tests measure the ability to perform well on standardized tests, not apply abstraction and logic to real-world problem solving.
 
The career observation is completely bound in gender-role norms/expectations and, most likely, indicative of only that.
 
Such makes mathematical talent extremely difficult to measure.

The main reason genetic differences matter is that we might be able to enhance humans by knowing them.
 
If there is a smarts gene ( i know, i know  a whole set of em with tradeoffs  ), we should find it.
 
The problem is that it is completely taboo to even suggest people study the issue earnestly.
 
Think about the opportunity cost of that decision. Specifically, think about the unenhanced researchers whose development is relatively impaired compared to where they could have been without the taboo.
 
Clearly there are huge genetic and sociological issues leading to the trends in disparity of outcome between groups.
 
Hoping to fight the unjust causes, such as blatant discrimination, should not come at the expense of hindering research.

Id be delighted to respond to Seths counterarguments about the correlation between genotype and phenotype, but so far, Seth has only addressed the correlation between being me and being Bad and Wrong and Dumb.
 
Of course models are provisional! Of course they could be wrong! Id be delighted to have some sort of laboratory to test them  perhaps some kind of educational system in which people of given attributes take tests, and these scores are recorded and later compared to the average success rates in those groups. For example, if our tests revealed that men and women had roughly equal ability, but different variances in skill, and if their later success demonstrated approximately equal average ability, but substantial variance in skill, we might decide that the correlation between gender and variance in mathematical ability implied some sort of correlation between gender and variance in mathematical ability.
 
Until that happy day, Seth and I will just have to use ad hominem arguments to emphasize how awful it is to disagree with us. Which is too bad, yknow?

Actually, the most likely response to this would be a simultaneous outcry from those who say, See, we always knew this, now we have proof and those who say, Studies like these could lead to discrimination and the scientists were irresponsible for even studying the question. Its largely the exact same response when studying race, IQ, poverty, religion, sexuality, etc.  Aggressive egalitarianism has many sacred-cows when it comes to refusing to acknowledge differences, for fear they can be used for further discrimination.
 
My own feeling is that the largest reason for the appearence of a gap in male/female math abilities, reflects preferences related to the types of employment math is used in, and how it is used.  Perhaps the job of university physics prefessor isnt, for completely different reasons, as attractive to women as other employment.
 
On the other hand, people who firmly deny sex-based differences in ability, have no problems embracing the idea that men are more aggressive and violent than women.

Title: Follow Your Heart
 
For years, Ive wanted to be on public radio. As a kid, we used to hear the voices of Garrison Keillor and Ira Glass and even Carl Kasell, while our parents drove us around in the stationwagon. As I grew older, I came to respect radio as a particularly unique medium for explaining things to people; a skill, like writing, that I wished to develop.
 
Ive had a few desultory attempts, but I finally had a good excuse to get my act together. Public broadcasting people are sponsoring a Public Radio Talent Quest and Ive decided to submit an entry. My idea was to make a radio show about science that matters.
 
Heres my first attempt. (You can listen and vote for me on the contests website.)
 
For those who dont love the magic of radio, a transcript follows:
 
Its 1958 and youre sitting on a table with your shirt off. You signed up for an experiment on vitamins improving vision and now someones plunging a needle into your arm. Ow! Since when do vitamins require needles anyway?
 
[music: Waltz (Better Than Fine) - Fiona Apple]
 
Now the man is gone and youre waiting for the experiment to start. Theres another kid here too. You both look pretty bored. Then the other kid starts goofing off. Doodling, making paper airplanes, that sort of thing. And then you feel it.
 
[TAP tap tap]
 
Your hands begin to shake. Your heart starts to pound. Your face begins to feel flushed.
 
[tap tap TAP.]
 
Boy, goofing off sure looks like fun. So you join in.
 
So that shot in your arm? The thing is, its actually adrenaline. Hand-shaking, heart-pounding, face-flushing adrenaline.
 
Half the kids in the experiment were told the shot might make their hearts race. And those kids? They sat quietly, even while the other kid in the room with them goofed off. But the rest? The ones, like you, who werent told? They joined right in.
 
One kid started throwing wads of paper at passersby. Another grabbed a piece of equipment off the wall and used it as a hula-hoop. They just felt so good, they later explained.
 
We think of our feelings as unerring: follow your heart, do what makes you happy  that sort of thing. But what the adrenaline experiment showed is that its not so simple. Feelings dont come with nice, clean explanations. Our brain makes a guess. And sometimes it guesses wrong.
 
Were not the slaves of our emotions. For the kids in the experiment, just knowing why they were feeling a certain way was enough to change their response.
 
Following your heart can be fun. But its also nice to know that you dont have to.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

Talking way too fast. Hula Hoop becomes huloop and the phrasing is: long pause followed by whirlwind delivery.
 
They probably only get to hear it once and you must hear it several times and you know what youre saying while it should come as a series of surprises to the listener - who shouldnt be forced to ever do a whatd he say?.
 
Relax.
 
Love.

I think its partly that you have very quick words, punctuated by long pauses.  It makes the whole thing sound less fluid than it could.  Like each short sentence is supposed to stand on its own.  I think you could stick to the time limit, and still slow down your speaking, and have it turn out alright.
 
Also, I wouldnt completely cut the bit of piano background in the beginning.  Just fade it and leave it going quietly behind you for a while.  Having it cut off adds to the abrupt feeling.
 
Generally pretty good though, certainly for a first try. :)

The short sentences work great in text, but less well when read aloud. Your writing style has probably been  been honed by years of checking your site stats daily, but a writing style that engages readers and maximizes hits is much different than a good speaking style.
 
Similarly, many of the constructions only work well visually. For example:
 
Then the other kid starts goofing off. Doodling, making paper airplanes, that sort of thing.
 
Here youre using a sentence ending with a verb, a period, and then a list of examples. Perfect for web copy, sounds really awkward when read aloud.
 
Also, your intonation tends to get worse at the end of sentences. Speaking in longer sentences would also help to ameliorate this, although granted youd have to fix this anyway.
 
Good overall design though. The informative bits do a good job at setting up the central insight at the end.

At first listen the pace made me miss a few unarticulated words, but having read the transcript and then listened again, the piece came together.

You do sound a lot like Ira Glass.  I read a very similar study on epinephrin.  The study was performed on grownups, and used a waiting room accomplice to induce the subject into a fight or a positive interaction.  Tough to squeeze a dramatic arc into 2 minutes.

I think Ive actually got a draft e-mail somewhere about this. Ive been looking for some site that addresses this. It seems a site could work, one that updates the state of countries based on several variables at several time scales. A table of countries and performance variables with a zoom button, but the zoom is temporal: 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, 100 years, 200 years. Maybe a temporal scroll function, so you can, in the time scale of your choice, step through the data: 1990s, 1980s, 1970s, 1960s, etc. Hans Rosling indicates this data is out there in his TED talk and names some of the data sources.
 
Each number in every table could presumably link through to a historical wiki article about that time period, providing non-numeric context.
 
How to measure peformance? Some baseline characteristics would have to be included: acreage, population, immigration rate, emigration rate, a cohort plot. World Mapper has an interesting array of other variables, but the data should be in tabular form for purpose of massively multivariate comparison, at least at the density of the stocks page or the sports page.

Aaron, I agree with your thinking about subtle sexism and racism in our industry, that the problem is widely misunderstood (as evidenced in the comments at blogoscoped).
 
There are at least four phases that organizations go through in addressing the problem, and there is lots of variability as to how quickly they progress.  1) the identification of overt sexist and racism, 2) attempts to enhance ?diversity? with awkward explicit or implicit quotas, 3) the recognition that organizations are more powerful, more effective, when they take advantage of individual differences, and 4) recognizing and driving  heterogeneity in thought, perspective, methods, as a competitive advantage.
 
I am a manager at Cisco.  The Cisco US engineering community is not particularly diverse by conventional measurement.  But the corporate culture is strongly driven by principles of inclusiveness and collaboration, harder to measure but better goals.  As more and more engineering happens outside the US the conventional metrics will take care of themselves.
 
One interesting stat: soon, worldwide, fewer that 30% of Cisco buy decisions will be made by white men.
 
Lastly, I?d like to better understand your mention of Cisco?s role in content filtering in China, will investigate further.

I did a little reading, and I speak here as an individual, not a Cisco employee.
 
It looks like the Chinese government (or their agents) use standard Cisco router packet filtering technology to build ?the great firewall?.  There are no Cisco engineers ?building? the firewall, there are no features or functionality being developed for the Chinese government.
 
 ?Google?s hackers are a lot smarter than the Cisco people building the Great Firewall of China. therefore may be a tad unfair.
 
There are, broadly, two classes of packet filters.  Filters that act on information available in IP packet headers (source IP, destination IP, etc.).  These filters are gross but can be executed very fast.  Finer filters can filter based on packet payload contents (keywords, patterns, etc.).  These finer filters exist primarily for signature-based intrusion detection.  They run much slower.  It appears that the Chinese government uses both
 
I?m not a Google engineer or even a Cisco engineer but both mechanisms would be trivial to circumvent with multiple hops/spoofing and encryption.   I suspect this is not a technology issue at all but one of policy, and for Chinese citizens, non-trivial personal risk.
 
As for Cisco?s role, I?ll continue to learn more.  It appears that Cisco?s actual contribution to the Great Firewall is its unwillingness to refuse to sell standard routers, not clear to me that that?s evil.  I?d be interested in and open to alternative views.

Title: The Incurable Romantic
 
romantica curious word meaning all things to all people. From my point of view, it means that in [ones] emotional relationships [one] should not be too brightsomething, perhaps, that I should not state so baldly. But again and again the action of the [romance] novels plot is carried forward by our heros failure to realize that in any mans life there are literally dozens, if not hundreds, of women who will do just as well; that he wont die if he doesnt win fair Susans dainty hand; and that very probably he will catch a most uninteresting variety of hell if he does win it. Which, come to think of it, is not unrealistic: emotional maturity is one of the rarest qualities in life.

I blame it on evolutionary traits that we, brainy humans, idealize and rationalize. The animal has to have some sort of fixation for the mate that it has found, so fit and all, so attractive. Really, we wouldnt bode well for the species if the interested animal just walked away from its mate at the first sign of trouble.
And then we humans make it into some sort of epic, and throw wars and tantrums in the name of love. We are neither romantic nor tragic, just animals with a huge brain.

What a dispassionate view of love. Sure, fundamentally, things like love, jealousy, and the soul are illusions  bursts of electricity or chemical reactions in our brains or whatever. Sure, we are nothing but animals, but Camilo: we are romantic and we are tragic, if those words have any meanings at all. The knowledge of the nature of our emotions does little to soothe the pain of jealousy or belittle the joy of holding a loved one. That is the joy of being human - the joy of being imperfect, irrational, and emotional.
 
Saying we are animals with a huge brain is like saying Googles servers are doing nothing but playing with 1s and 0s, ignoring the service they are bringing to civilization.

Andrei, you are an artist or a computer scientist. Or both. And you are right - I was trying to be glib about one of the most fundamental drives in our lives, and a force so strong that it even defies clear and imminent dangers.
 
Yerby is correct: we do not need that particular person to be happy, and many other people will come later. But it is because the way we treat that one person that we define our life and the way we see the world. It is just that, sometimes, it is painful.

Title: A Call for Science that Matters
 
Ever see a study that makes you scratch your beard? Ever hear about a research result that makes you go I wish everybody knew about this!? Ever want to run into a congressmans office and hit them over the head with a journal article? In this era of technological complexity and postmodern fiction, sometimes brain scans can reveal more about the human condition than a new novel. And yet, while the novels get detailed reviews in the New York Times, the best a research study is likely to get is an inaccurate description and some ambiguous quotes from the studys authors.
 
Well, heres your chance to change that. In the comments, post your favorite study  the one that makes you sit up and say wow, this result ought to change everything. If you dont mind, well take the best to help fill up a new website were starting, collecting and sharing these new research results. (If you want to help us with the project, be sure to let us know!)
 
Ill go first:
 
In 1994, the RAND Corporation, a major US military think tank, conducted a massive study (with funding from the Office of National drug Control Policy, the US Army, and the Ford Foundation) to measure the effectiveness of various forms of preventing the use of illegal drugs, particularly cocaine.
 
They analyzed a variety of popular methods and calculated how much it would cost to use each method to reduce cocaine consumption in the US by 1%. Source-country control  military programs to destroy drug production in countries like Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia  are not just devastating to poor third-world citizens; theyre also the least effective, costing $783 million for a 1% reduction. Interdiction  seizing the drugs at the border  is a much better deal, costing only $366 million. Domestic law enforcement  arresting drug dealers and such  is even better, at $246 million. But all of those are blown completely out of the water by the final option: funding treatment programs for drug addicts would reduce drug use by 1% at a cost of only $34 million.
 
In other words, for every dollar spent on trying to stop drugs through source-country control, we could get the equivalent of twenty dollars benefit by spending the same money on treatment. This isnt a bunch of hippy liberals saying this. This is a government think tank, sponsored by the US Army.
 
OK, your turn.

I think the study quoted in this article very interesting: The researcher began the game by exerting a fixed amount of pressure on the first volunteers finger. The first volunteer was then asked to exert precisely the same amount of pressure on the second volunteers finger. The second volunteer was then asked to exert the same amount of pressure on the first volunteers finger. And so on. The two volunteers took turns applying equal amounts of pressure to each others fingers while the researchers measured the actual amount of pressure they applied.
 
The results were striking. Although volunteers tried to respond to each others touches with equal force, they typically responded with about 40 percent more force than they had just experienced.

If half of the students in a programming class are incapable of abstract reasoning (and will fail that class because of it), what does that say about the general population?
 
Prescription: people incapable of abstract reasoning need to be made into second-class citizens, with absolutely no say in any important social, political or economic decisions. Nothing to say about pollution, energy, healthcare, tax policy, war, peace, not even the political system itself. Their judgement is provably no good.

And empathic parenting is only the tip of a very big iceberg in research about the history of childhood. Childhood in the past was horrific. And childhood in primitive cultures is horrific.

Research is interesting. Experimental results that are published due to a expected outcome are interesting. Experimental results that are not published due to an unexpected outcome can be even more interesting.
 
Its great to publish results when an experiment produces desired results. But what if out of 100 tests, only 5 succeed and 95 fail. However, its the 5 that succeed that are published? We are left believing the experiments are valid and reproducible when they are not 95 out of 100 times.

Interesting idea. Heres a survey that changed how I think about diet. Summary: Half of all chemicals tested in standard high-dose animal cancer tests, whether occurring naturally or produced synthetically, are carcinogens.   The focus of regulatory policy is on synthetic chemicals, although 99.9% of the chemicals humans ingest are natural.  Plants in the human diet contain thousands of natural pesticides produced by plants to protect themselves from insects and other predators.  If reducing synthetic pesticides makes fruits and vegetables more expensive, thereby decreasing consumption, then the cancer rate will increase, especially for the poor.

These were some really great posts; I read all of the linked articles.  Some of the cognitive bias ones were annoying because the researchers seemed oblivious that when asking people to Rank by probability: (1) A, (2) A and B that English is just ambiguous enough that its legitimate (or not, depending on precise wording) to rank (2) as more probable than (1).  Some of the other cognitive bias questions also likewise seemed stacked.  I wonder about the cognitive bias of people when confronted with the possibility that modern physics experiments may cause catastrophic events; for example, Ive been wondering for some time about the Large Hadron Colliders safety report, which uses Hawkings (untested) theory to that argue that the world will not end when the LHC starts up.  Now six different academics authored this paper [1], but one wonders about cognitive bias when one realizes that they are effectively promising that 6 billion people on our planet will not die due to the logical consequences of an untested theory.  Perhaps I misread the paper or perhaps I should contact the authors and ask for an explanation.
 
The programmers fall into 2 categories writeup is really informal; I think one should look for better studies in that area.

If one is being strictly rational, it probably makes sense to throw billions of dollars at researching life extension on humans and species similar to us.  Most people are strictly irrational when dealing with the ethical issues of letting people live longer, thus the pressing need to popularize life extension research.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey

Title: Secured Leisure
 
When I was disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business, I flattered myself that, by the sufficient though moderate fortune I had acquired, had secured leisure during the rest of my life for philosophical studies and amusements. I purchased all Dr. Spences apparatus, who had come from England to lecture in Philadelphia, and I proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the public, now considering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for their purposes; every part of our civil governmentand almost at the same timeimposing some duty upon me. The Governor put me into the commission of the peace; the corporation of the city chose me one of the common council, and soon after alderman; and the citizens at large elected me a burgess to represent them in the Assembly.

Improved ecommerce for public benefit?
 
Someone with computer skills and leisure might take a look at a project that could make new business models feasible  especially for musicians, artists, and other small businesses selling digital content at low prices.
 
By lucky accident I explored possible uses for online financial accounts that could REPRODUCE through any number of generations, inherit many services, options, and methods through family trees, and evolve in community use. Its new and appears revolutionary, but hasnt received much attention.
 
My overview at www.smart-accounts.org may look too good to be true. But if it wont work, then somebody whos bright could figure that out quickly. Ive looked for a showstopper for two years and havent found one.
 
This idea needs both commercial and open-source development. It should be available for all, not locked away in some corporations patent collection. I published it quietly for just that purpose, and have no proprietary claims.

Title: Everything Good is Bad For You
 
While we were developing Reddit, we always used to run into people whod recognize us and come up to say hi. Oh, wow, theyd say to us. I cant tell you how much your site has killed my productivity. I check it a hundred times every day. At first, we just laughed these comments off. But after a while, I begun to find them increasingly disturbing. Wed set out to make something people want  but what if they didnt want to want it?
 
For too long, simple popularity has been the only metric of a startups success. Another startup, known as Twitter, has recently broken into the mainstream. And I constantly hear people saying things like Yeah, well, I know it seems like a pointless waste of time. But its so popular! As if anything so popular had to be worthwhile.
 
Cory Doctorow recently made a similar argument. When he publishes his books online, he notes, people are always telling him they dont like reading off a screen. And yet, these very same people spend every free hour of the day reading email and weblogs and news articles off a screen. Its like watching someone shovel Mars Bars into his gob while telling you how much he hates chocolate, Doctorow complains. Doctorows conclusion? Blogs are just better.
 
But I think Mars Bars are just the right analogy. Everyone in America knows that its easy to accidentally find yourself stuffing your face with junk food when youre not paying attention. But no one would seriously maintain that junk food is better than fine cuisine. Its just easier.
 
Similarly, if you printed out all the blog posts and news articles and emails the average timewaster reads in a month and placed the resulting hulking volume down next to a copy of, say, War and Peace (which it would no doubt dwarf), its hard to imagine the average person saying theyd actually prefer to sit down and read the first. (If War and Peace doesnt strike your fancy, substitute a similarly large tome.) But reading bite-sized blog posts is by far easier.
 
The same goes for reading stories on Reddit or your friends pointless twits about their life. Looking at photos of sunsets or reading one-liners takes no cognitive effort. Its the mental equivalent of snack food. You start eating one and before you know it youve gone through two cans of Pringles and become a world expert on Evan Williams travel habits.
 
We need to stop pretending that this is automatically a good thing. Perhaps Procter & Gamble doesnt care of their making us into a nation of fat slobs, but theres no reason why programmers and the rest of the startup world need to be so amoral. And no doubt, as pictures of cats with poor spelling on them become all the rage, people are beginning to wonder about where all this idiocy is leaving us. Which is where apologists like Doctorow and Steven Johnson step in, assuring us that Everything Bad is Good For You.
 
It isnt. YouTube isnt going to save us from an Idiocracy-style future in which everyone sits at home and watches shows like Ow! My Balls! (in which a man is repeatedly hit in the balls)  YouTubes damn-near creating that future. As I write this, YouTubes #1 featured video is titled Farting in Public.
 
It doesnt have to be that way, of course. Nobody prefers farting to thought. Its just that, as David Foster Wallace noted about television, people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests. Similarly, no one (Doctorow included, I suspect), actually prefers blog posts to novels, its just that people tend to have more short chunks of time to read blog posts than they do long chunks of time to read novels.
 
Technology was supposed to let us solve these problems. But technology never solves things by itself. At bottom, it requires people to sit down and build tools that solve them. Which, as long as programmers are all competing to create the worlds most popular timewaster, it doesnt seem like anyone is going to do.

Agreed although Id like to point out that nowadays these things seem to be more about people and governance than about technology.
 
You could probably use the twitters and reddits of the world for all kinds of useful things, if you really wanted to.

sorry, just had to do it. ;)  where does compilation and aggregation fit in to all of this? personally, im not a huge fan of twitter, on its own but i think that if twitter were mashed up with other bite sized services, integrated into larger social meshes, and delivered through more effective medium, it could be a very valuable building block.

I think internet content is a slight improvement on what came before.  Lets compare:
 
Watching Americas Funniest Home Videos
 
Reading political blogs
 
Watching CNN
 
Wasting time at work reading reddit
 
Wasting time at home watching Everybody Loves Raymond
 
Reading comics in the newspaper
 
(On the comics front, at least, internet publishing is a huge winner.  Probably because comics already fit the bite-size chunk model).

Question: So, is there an olive oil for the mind?
 
Thought (as I burned the time involved in a page of War and Peace reading this and now writing): Who is driving the log-file level trends we see? Im sure you have demographics data on reddit users, right? Are they 19 or 34? Whats their average income? If video games might be good for smarts, is it also possible that the Internet might still something for the better?

The problem is with schedules of reinforcement. Blogs, being candy bars serve up their nugget of reinforcement quickly. The novel has a very long amount of reading for a more complex, richer and more sophisticated (perhaps weaker) reinforcement - insight into oneself, the human condition, and so on. A blog makes a pithy insight and we are done and we throw the candy wrapper away.
 
Youtube is the perfect example of the quick payoff reinforcer. Video is often instantly reinforcing for looking at it, and the activities involved are often more so.
 
I have not seen your site reddit but I am sure it is good since it seems to generate behavior according to your plug.

One side of these things are of course that people watch YouTube or read blogs and social bookmarking sites but the other side is that the same people also produce the content. Its easy to say that watching pictures of cute kittens or the latest high powered beer cannon might not be very intellectually stimulating but for people who in the past exclusively would have been information consumers to start producing their own content on a large scale can not be so easily disregarded. No matter what you think about the content in itself we are talking about people breaking down the top down communication model of older media and replacing it with something much more democratic and p2p. So if people are consuming information created by their peers and producing their own just for entertainment they will probably deal with politics the same way. What we want is for people not only to read a few more books a year, we want people to start talking to each other about society and to start acting together to change society.

That used to just be a weak joke, but not any more. When web folk talk shop, the highest praise is to say that that someones site is habit-forming. Highly trained people spend their every waking moment trying to make a media product hit someones pleasure center in just the right way. Is there a real difference between that job, and say, genetically engineering tobacco for a higher nicotine level?

But, Ill still take Web 2.0 over the mass media. Yes, the dumbing-down is happening, but so is the smarting-up. The world is slowly learning how to filter information without commercial or governmental gatekeepers  Reddit is just one step along the way and I hope you have some pride in that. Long term, Im optimistic.

Aaron, I think you might find it interesting that the topics of most of your recent blogs have paralleled the same thoughts that B.F. Skinner once had. In fact, you are arguing the same exact things.
 
We can point to remarkable achievements in all these fields, and it is not surprising that we should try to extend them. But things grow steadily worse, and it is disheartening to find that technology itself is increasingly at fault.  Beyond Freedom and Dignity
 
We want to do something - we want to find out whats the matter with people, why they cant live together without fighting all the time. We want to find what people really want, what they need in order to be happy, and how they can do it without stealing it from somebody else.  Walden Two
 
If youre looking for answers to your problems, societys problems, and man-kinds problems, Skinner has proposed them. The reason why they were politically rejected is an interesting story for another time.
 
Its all right to stir people up, get them interested. Thats better than nothing. But in the long run youre only passing the buck.  Walden Two
 
Its a job for research, but not the kind you can do in a university, or in a laboratory anywhere. I mean youve got to experiment, and experiment with your own life! Not just sit back not just sit back in an ivory tower somewhere as if your own life werent all mixed up in it.  Walden Two
 
Cheers and keep it coming.

Scott: Leadership in choosing important problems to solve is lacking, as always. However, Im not sure how many people (read: hackers) would join a company that, say, computes ways for Americans to conserve electricity.
 
pwb: Novels can be a waste of time. Youtube can be too. I think the point of Aarons post is that programmers have by-and-large abdicated responsibility for how their creations are used (you cant be a hacker if you go around telling people what to do all the time, I suppose). Does Youtubes ability to spread video that authorities dont want seen make up for fart videos? I dont think I can answer that. Are there features that Youtube could add that would make important-but-not-hip videos more accessible? Yes.
 
Lloyd: Yes, the web has improved media in many cases. What if we get so good at entertaining ourselves that we never have to stop and think? That question may sound far-fetched, but more programmers should ask it as they sit down to grab users attention.
 
Im starting to sound like a preacher. You shouldnt waste time on the web! You shouldnt smoke or commit adultery! I dont want paternalistic sites that tell me how I should be entertained/informed. I do want hackers to start asking themselves, How do we build something that people want that is useful?

Just to save people the need to click, the argument is that some forms of widely-observed discounting of the future lead to inconsistent outcomes (youd rather had read W&P, but you red blog comments like this one instead).
 
As Wikipedia says, the functional equation for hyperbolic discounting is as follows: v = V / (1 + kD)
 
where v is the discounted [future] value of the reward, V is the undiscounted value of the reward, D is the delay in the reward, and k is the degree of discounting.

Dan, I think programmers in general are more idealistic than the population at large, but that may just be those Im watching (e.g. Aaron). If that company is offering a job, Id be interested. But in my experience, such a company would be hiring part-time or a volunteer position, because they dont have the money to hire a full-time programmer, because they dont have enough support from the general public, because the general public doesnt recognize energy consumption as a more important problem than, say, knowing what their friends around the world are eating for lunch.

So, why not make a) more subreddits or b) (the better option, I suppose) allowing people to create subgroups from reddit. I, for instance, am interested in reading all about neuroscience, and if such a subreddit with an selection procedure kind-of-thing would exist, I would be inclined to register as a user.
 
Moreover, why not give people the ability to indicate which language they speak in a users profile, so articles in all their languages could show up for those users, instead of having only English ones?

Aaron, sometimes I find your comments a bit perplexing because, in the case of this post, you fail to take into account that statistics on popularity do not correlate (necessarily) to the overall positive or negative effect something may have on culture as a whole.  For example, even if YouTubes most popular video has to do with farting in public, this does not correlate to the idea that most people enjoy watching videos of others farting in public, just that the people who frequent YouTube do.  My dad, for example has never visited YouTube and counts as one of the tens of millions who never have and probably never will.
Furthermore, if we were to actually look at many of the inventions which people initially criticized for having negative impacts on people and culture in general (Im sure people made this claim about the telephone, faxes, email and even things like flying - I read a post of someone recently who believes that flying has made the world less well off because cultures are melding into one another - a concept I find preposterous, for many reasons I wont get into here), we will find that while there is a contingent who uses it in a completely useless manner, superficially, it has brought great benefit to culture.  The telephone is a perfect example.  While on one hand we could say it keeps people from feeling the need to visit one another, it opens up a whole other avenue to communication with people you wouldnt normally or ever be able to communicate with.  (For example, my wife is from Germany and I can only imagine how seldom we would hear from them or vice versa due to the fact that we are extremely busy on both sides of the Atlantic.)
So, as far as questioning whether applications being developed are making people more productive or not, I dont think that is a question that you can even begin to guess the effects of (using induction or whatever form of science/quasi-science you wish).  Twitter is an example of an application my colleagues (in the tech business) and I have debated.  While I feel that 99% of the content of Twitter is useless, just like that of the net, the raw content as a whole is telling about the subculture that uses it - and you need to remember that users cant be judged solely on their tweets/twitter comments, but also need to be viewed in relation to the content they produce on the web as a whole - and misses the potential positive effect it has on a sub-subculture within Twitter.  (I, for example, have been practicing using it for taking notes on two philosophy essays Im writing and have found it to be a great tool I cant find elsewhere because of the sources of input - i.e. IM, api or SMS - I can use for sending updates to my feed.  If you combine that feed with other items I have written, I think it is definitely a productive use of web technologies.  You are free to disagree, of course)
In the end, your twist on application developers needing to funnel their creative talents towards creating applications that are good for us is appalling because it assumes you or someone else knows what is good for me and good for culture as a whole.  (And I use appalling to emphasize my belief that trying to manage or control the way people interact in a free society harkens us back to the days where the Church in western Europe wanted to control what people believed and were allowed to learn - as an example.)  People should be free to chose their sources of relaxation (i.e. outlets) and also where their education come from.  For me, that freedom is responsible for the rapid progress we have made in science, theology, philosophy, etc. in the past two centuries.  Now all of this assumes you agree with my premise that the past two centuries are full of progress - and you may not, but thats another discussion.

Its the boiling frog analogy and the path of least
resistance again.  People will tolerate just about
anything if it comes in small enough chunks.  With
sites like Youtube, remember the long tail.  I have
found many valuable videos there, mostly live music
performances, so it has enriched my life even if
I never watch the popular videos.  I find that,
despite all the talk of empowering individuals,
the best content is still produced by dedicated
people and even the best home video or blog post
has little to offer in comparison to research,
software, books, or art done by full-time
dedicated people.  As another commenter noted,
if you kill user-driven publishing sites like
Youtube, people driven to distraction will find
new distractions elsewhere.  Plus youll be killing
off the long tail, and a lot of people will lose
a lot of value.  I dont see any other legitimate
way than self-motivated self-improvement to make
people stop wasting their time, but I havent
thought about the issue at depth.

I think this is a really good point, Aaron. There comes a time when you just have to say to yourself I dont want to waste that much time, and do something more productive. I dont play World of Warcraft because I want to spend time writing code and getting good grades in school. Is it fun and easy? Sure. But in the end I dont think its worth it.
 
I have friends who live a lifestyle similar to your short attentive requirement/mars bar analogy. They watch a lot of TV, and dont do much else with their lives. All of this seems to fit with the hyperbolic time discounting model.
 
Its also far easier to write short blog posts than it is to sit down and think about something important, but the latter is usually better. I like your blog posts specifically because they tend to contain bigger thoughts that actually get my brain working and take some effort.
 
But youre right. Its very easy to succumb to reddit and think oh, Ill just spend five minutes. Forty minutes later Im sad that Ive wasted so much time. But sometimes it does keep me informed on whats happening in the world, or give me a new avenue of thought about something interesting. Is it worth it? I suppose each person might have to find where to set their own limit.
 
So good thoughts. I will have to watch my habits and force myself to do more productive things than easy things. The ironic part is that I found this blog entry after spending an hour browsing through feeds in Sage.

Someone should write a Firefox extension that you could configure only once a day (or so). You would set how frequently you can visit a certain site (your gmail account, your reddit listings, your rss feeds if they are on bloglines), and then it would refuse to browse to those sites after you hit your self-imposed limit.
 
Our resolution at the beginning of the day would then take precedence over our weakness whenever we have a free moment.

Id prefer to read the bits of blogs to War and Peace.  Blogs have information that helps you; War and Peace is presumably written in a classical style which I personally am discomforted by.  But if it came down to reading the bits of blogs vs a brilliant nonfiction book, Id again choose the bits of blogs as theyre more useful to me, and if it came down to reading the bits of blogs vs a good fictional novel Id probably choose both.
 
But Ive never been able to figure out why the public cares about what it cares about.  Therefore, making something that is popular alone seems pointless.  Any benefit will have to come from other factors, like being a technological stepping stone or smacking people in the face with a new paradigm, or little network effects that are hard to see unless you squint.

Ill proceed to restate my previous comment in a more comprehensible and positive tone.  Im usually grossed out by popularity.  But I think that people do want to create cool things, and there are so many barriers in the way that programmers can really help the situation by knocking down some of the barriers with technological and social fixes.  So yeah, I think that programmers do have a duty to do something beneficial for the public.  Adding fuel to the blaze of apathy and popularity I think is destructive.

I think the point of this post is that people do, on some level, recognize the importance of global problems. Its just that at any given point in time, its easy to do local, immediately rewarding things than to worry about global problems. Thats why well-meaning, curious people are sucked into reading the web for hours. Aarons pointing out that hackers have abdicated responsibility for not thinking globally. Make something people want is justification in and of itself.
 
Come to think of it, perhaps that directive should guide how you build something, not what you build. At least when youre tackling large problems. First, answer Richard Hammings questions: Whats the most important thing you could be working on? Why arent you? Then, as you work on that important thing, make something that people want.

But many of you have independently found out how to deal with it: self-restriction.
 
A particularly annoying minister here wanted a special card for playing on slot machines. Datatilsynet, the special government group set up to handle privacy issues, shot down that idea pretty quickly. But Im not so sure its a totally bad idea.
 
If it could be done in a way that respected peoples privacy, would you be in favour of a system that allowed people to put restrictions on themselves? For instance a card (with appropriate crypto magic to remove the privacy issue) that you used when buying cigarettes, gambling, etc, that you could configure to stop yourself from giving in to your vices of choice for a week, a month, or a year? Forget the practical and privacy issues for a moment. Do you see any ethical problems with this?

Want to talk about wasted time! Every time I sit down to read Infinite Jest, I end up ignoring all the things I ought to be doing (chores, work, interaction with other human beings). I think its amusing you quoted Wallace, given one of the main themes in his writing is obsessing over trivial things (like entertainment).

Ive been noticing this for a long time. The thing is, as you said, people inherently dont like to read things on their computers. There is no computer-based solution to this, only faster-paced and smarter versions of Reddit on the horizon, moving us closer and closer towards total destruction of our attention spans.
 
If you want to spend time well, start by turning off your computer.

YouTube can be a fantastic source of culture. Just look up Casals, Prelude in G, Piaf, Brel, Manolete.
 
You can see the only film ever made of Leadbelly. Albert Ammon playing his Stomp Boogie Woogie. The mind-boggling musical dexterity of Adam Fulara. Dozens of talented sopranos doing O mio babbino caro in their own way.
 
Where else will you ever see the late Renata Tebaldi doing the heart-wrenching Un Bel Di?
 
Hours of fun. Better than TV.

I fully agree with you regarding say twitter, but I believe the its about return on investment. I spend the first hour of each day looking at reddit. By the end of that hour I feel in touch with american politics, have probably picked up a few interesing facts about breaking news in science, know about some obscure and bizarre creature of the depths and get quick comparisons of cultural differences across the world etc. 
Although I love reading, spending the same hour reading War and Peace will not give me as wide a kick-start to my global community life as reddit.
You could spend lots of short timespans reading a novel but spending those same moments on reddit exposes you to so much more

Plenty of good points here.
 
As to why we read reddit (even if we dont want to want to read reddit) I think its like reading the gossip of the web. And simply put, were hardwired to want to hear gossip. Just like were hardwired to like the sugar in Mars Bars.
 
For most of humanitys history, its benefited us to keep up on gossip and to eat sugary things. Evolution just hasnt been able to keep up.

The Wallace quote reminds me of the old Christian adage that or sins are pretty much the same old boring thing (seeking a lesser good, of which there are few), while each mans way of expressing virtue are quite distinct.

I run a site that attempts to offer a wide range of mind stimulating content, many of which are challenging articles that would take some time to read.
 
From watching stats over the years , I would conclude the same general truth - people are more attracted to more links to information , or downloading audio lectures of information they can save for later , or watching quick videos , than they are to digging deeper into the articles.
 
But having been an information addict for years , I can attest that later never comes , and the library of digital info available to us keeps growing - but our ability to stay in one place long enough to integrate any of it seems to be shrinking.

Didnt the BBC once consider themselves responsible for the betterment of the public?
 
They tried to offer the public what they considered the best of the best, but were criticized for being elitist.  Who were they, after all, to decide what was best for each individual?  In the end, they cant compete with people who give people what they want which is usually some form of pabulum.
 
If the people at reddit feel that it is their obligation to provide material for the betterment of their audience, then perhaps they should start some sort of elite group that sifts through the waste for the gems (using some agreed upon, documented criteria available for public scrutiny) providing these to the public via some page?
 
Perhaps you could have a Reddit Editors Choice page for links that are judged to be of superior value?
 
Id go to that page, and if I agreed with your standards, Id frequent it.

Aaron,
 
The point about Reddit and YouTube is not that a lot of the content is inane or crap. When you get a very large user base, the average quality of posts goes down. The important aspect is that such sites make the few nuggets of quality content much easier to find and to spread to a wider audience. When I read reddit, I filter through to open only what looks relevant to me. The few gems each week make me more informed than scanning the papers. As soon as I find the return on my time too low, Ill stop visiting Reddit.
 
Finally, if people find themselves wasting time on Reddit, it just means they have time to waist.
You must already know that most corporate jobs are more about scratching your balls than scratching your head ;)

Ive recently wasted about 30+ hous of my life watching the first 3 seasons of 24.  Ive also gotten 30+ hours of Jack Bauer entertainment awesomeness time out of it.
 
The same can be said re: reddit.  For every hour wasted, theres a great link or vide that I never wouldve stumbled upon otherwise, like the recent Mike Gravel video.

Title: John Hockenberry on Reporting the War at NBC
 
John Hockenberry is a long-time, well-known American journalist. Hes won four Emmy awards and three Peabody awards. Now that, as he puts it, mainstream media doesnt want John Hockenberry anymore, hes become a Distinguished Fellow at the MIT Media Lab, where he recently gave a talk which commented on some of his experiences covering the Iraq war while at NBC.
 
Here are some excerpts:
 
I was very happily employed at NBC. I wasnt like, running around, trying to stuff toilet paper into the plumbing and sabotage the place. [] But I was interested, because we had a lot of meetings at NBC about, you know, if youre doing a story and the person youre doing the story about offers to buy you a drink, youve gotta say no. If youre doing a story and they send you, after they see the story, some napkin rings  silver napkin rings that are monogrammed Thank you, Jon, for the story, youve got not only to return those, youve got to report those to the standards people at NBC because theres a whole ethics and conflict-of-interest thing.
 
So at one of these ethics meetings  I called them the return-the-napkin-ring kinds of meetings  I raised my hand and said You know, isnt it a problem that the contract that GE has with the Coalition Provisional Authority [] to rebuild the power generation system in Iraq [is] about the size of the entire budget of NBC? Is that kind of like the napkin rings thing? And the standards people said Huh. Thats interesting. No ones brought that up before. Now Im not saying that Im smart or that Im advanced or that Im ahead of my colleagues or maybe I had a lot of free time to think about this or maybe Im some pinko-proto-lefty like Richard Nixon. I dont know! But the fact that it drew a complete blank among the NBC standards people was interesting to me.
 
[Now] in fact what happens in the networks  and you can find this at ABC and other networks at well  is that this [conflict with the profit motive] manifests itself [as journalists saying] Well, we are better reporters because we deal with these kinds of conflicts all the time. And because we deal with those and we always decide in favor of the audience, it sort of exercises our journalistic muscle. And this is the line you get from all of the entities.
 
You may or may not be aware that there was a real strong full-court press to sell the media  and Im not pro- or against it at this particular point, but there was a process in place where individuals in the media got access to the individuals involved in the planning of the war. There were generals who came in, there were former secretaries of defense, Schwarzkopf spent a whole lot of time giving sort of off-the-record, quiet briefings. And the generals would sort of bring in a certain group of editors and reporters and I went to all of these briefings.
 
At one of them, Hockenberry explains, a well-known pollster told about a briefing he gave to all the senior officials at the White House about how the polling data from the Arab world showed that Americas negatives were simply off-the-charts. Everyone was quiet. Condi asked a few technical questions and then finally Karl Rove spoke up. Well, thats just until we start throwing our weight around over there, he said.
 
Hockenberry was stunned and thought they should do a piece on what this revealed into the mentality of the wars planners. But NBC News didnt think this was a very good idea. America wanted the war to happen; their job was just to wait and see how it turned out. Were not particularly interested in the story, Hockenberry explains. Were a process thats trying to maintain people in front of the set, so in a certain sense media at that point was doing its own kind of shock-and-awe that went right along with the wars shock-and-awe [because] the business is just to grab eyeballs.
 
Later, his team edited together a montage of clips about what it was like for reporters who were still in Iraq to experience the shock-and-awe campaign. Vibrant images, narrated by a tense reporter who was on the ground at the time.
 
We played this piece for the editors. And it was very moving, very powerful, and it was a very different perspective from what we were getting. And at the end [] there was quiet around the table, because it was kind of an emotional piece and certainly the emotion in this reporters voice was detectable over a satellite phone line.
 
And the standards person goes  and again, this is his job, I dont begrudge him that  he goes, Seems like, seems like she has a point of view here.
 
The table was silent. Just dead silent. And I was infuriated. But whenever I get this sort of infuriated feeling I think You know, this is a career-ending moment here. There is something I could say that would be right. There is something I could say that would be wrong. And there is something that I could say that would be right  and also would be wrong.
 
And it was the beginning of the coverage of an event that would be extraordinary and I definitely wanted to be around to be a part of the next days coverage, but I had to say something. And it seemed as though, if nobody said anything, people would go well, I guess well have to tone her down.
 
So I said, You mean, the war-is-bad point of view?
 
The piece aired.

Because John Hockenberry is part of the DRM (Disability Rights Movement) his outsiderness credentials go unremarked, but its worth noting that like most PWD (Persons With Disabilities) he brings something to all this stuff thats unique.

Wouldnt shedding light onto the mentality of the wars planners grab a huge amount of eyeballs? Thats what always gets me. Its just an excuse to toe the party line and spread party propaganda. The news would sell just as much, or more, if they would expose scandalous stories of the war planners and their idiocy. They choose not to do that as it goes against the other (grander) financial interests of the parent companies (e.g. General Electric).

Title: Aarons Patented Demotivational Seminar
 
Thousands of people out there are willing to give you a motivational seminar, but only Aarons Patented Demotivational Seminars are going to actually admit they demotivate you. Ive collected thousands of actual facts from real scientists and the verdict is in: people dont matter, except for a couple of rare exceptions, and youre not one of them. Sorry.
 
Lets start at the beginning, shall we? The universe is a bunch of random particles shooting through space following a handful of simple laws. Through completely random and unintentional properties, some of those particles bounced together to form you. But, I swear, it was a total accident. They didnt even realize they were doing it at the time and if they knew theyd probably feel kind of guilty about it.
 
For a long time, it was pretty clear that most people didnt matter. The average person didnt leave their town or village and so only interacted with a small handful of people who lived near them, most of whom found them annoying. The Internet has changed all that. Now the average person doesnt leave their computer and so only interacts with a small handful of spammers who read their LiveJournal, most of whom find them annoying. Luckily for posterity, their LiveJournal will probably disappear within their lifetime due to a hard drive crash or some other kind of poor server maintenance.
 
But lets say you want to make a difference in the world. You can learn a skill and go into a profession, where you get bossed around and told exactly what to do by people more powerful than you. (Obeying them is called professionalism.) Its completely futile; had you not gone into the professional (or if you decide to disobey orders) they would have found someone else to do the exact same thing.
 
The same is true even if youre the one giving orders. Imagine about the most powerful job you can think of. Lets say youre a US Supreme Court Justice, able to change the laws of the worlds only superpower with the stroke of your pen. Well, big deal. Had you not been appointed to the Supreme Court the President who appointed you would have found some other judge who would have made the same changes to the law. Yeah, you get to wear a robe and feel powerful, but when you look at the cold, hard, scientific facts, youre not making a lick of difference in the world.

I heartily disagree. And, to top it off, I found your post motivating.
 
Actually, people do matter when it comes to other people. (I dont know if they matter in the grand scheme of the universe.) And, though I get your point about being outside of the system, none of us are outside of a system. And it has been amazing me lately how much difference just one person in a powerful (or even not so powerful position) can make.
 
It is easy just to be a cog in the wheel, so I reccomend (to myself who wants to make a positive difference) to act with integrity and kindness - which alone can radiate out with such vast ripples of effect - and to be deliberate about which wheels I am a part of.
 
Even doing what I love and being willing to be happy is a blow to facism, frankly.

Quote: The universe is a bunch of random particles shooting through space following a handful of simple laws. Through completely random and unintentional properties, some of those particles bounced together to form you. But, I swear, it was a total accident.
 
Alright, sorry to be a nerd. Im doing a PhD in Physics so please understand my agnst. FIRST, the laws of nature are NOT SIMPLE!! Dude!! What did you get for your Physics exams? Einsteins 4D description of space-time might seem like a simple idea to the layman (and I suspect a lot of lay people think they understand it because theyve seen a rubber sheet being deformed and a ball dropped into it), but have you actually tried solving Riemann Tensors for anything but the non-trivial cases? Its hard!! Very hard! And theres a lot more going on than the rubber sheet have you believe! And dont get me started with real Quantum Mechanics. Its full of postulates which cant be explained with convential logic and the number of postulates in QM is rather large (especially when you try to use the theory for solving real problems) - probably because its an ad hoc [read: crap] theory which hopefully will be replaced with something more elegant [read: more self consistent with fewer postulates]. Which brings me to the frontier of Physics - your Brane Theories, which incidently are also not simple to understand, even for the most gifted indidivals of this species. Yes you might have read Brian Greenes book, but its my personal experience (as a scientist) that other scientists deliberately leave out the crucial details when presenting a paper. And the devil Aaron, is in the detail!
 
Maybe when you meant handful of simple rules you meant simple to the atoms? Or simple to some God-like entity? Clearly they aint simple to us mere mortals!
 
Which brings me to my next point (abruptly): Entropy. Im not sure if you know much about the subject. I suspect if not, a googling is in order. Its a much loved subject close to my heart. Ill assume you know what the concept entails. So according to Entropy we didnt arrive by random chance. Human life was thermodynamically favourable for the given circumstances at the time, ergo we exist. I think you miss used the word random. Entropy is very much like Evolution, yes there is randomness - but its not truely random. In evolution some species are more preferential to others and hence survive and reproduce. I always thought of it as the same thing with Entropy - some energy configurations are more favourable than others, hence they exist. Again for anything but the most trivial example its very difficult to understand.
 
The great question (Im sure your smart enough to have spotted it) is Why? Why are humans entropically favourable? Is it because we increase the disorderness of the universe? Or are we a meta-state for something greater?
 
Life, is anything but simple and very few things happen in a vaccum.

This may be the most overtly revolutionary thing Ive seen in your blog!  Sure, its a bit of an over-simplification, but breaking things down to their simplest terms can also help to prevent meaningless justifications.  Thinking outside of the common paradigm is often the only way to matter.  Most other existences only allow you to BE matter.

Title: The Secret Behind The Secret
 
The #1 bestselling book in America is a 216-page volume called The Secret, based on a DVD of the same title. Truly life-changing information, exclaims the publisher on Amazon.com. A new era for humankind, exults the web site. This is The Secret to everything  the secret to unlimited joy, health, money, relationships, love, youth: everything you have ever wanted. [] [It] utterly transformed the lives of every person who ever knew it Plato, Newton, Carnegie, Beethoven, Shakespeare, Einstein.
 
What is this incredible secret? Namely, that the universe is governed by a heretofore unknown Law of Attraction, as yet undiscovered by conventional physicists, that the world rearranges itself to conform to your thoughts. Or, as one proponent put it, the universe is akin to a big mail-order department, in which you order what you get by sending energetic messages out to the universe.
 
This stuff is so blatantly absurd that its not really worth debunking. And its silly enough that Barbara Ehrenreich has already written the definitive mockery (Thoughts exert a gravitational-type force on the world, so that whenever you think something, the thought immediately attracts its physical equivalent. If you think money  in a totally urgent, focused and positive way, of course  it will come flying into your pockets.). Twice (I dont have to write this blog, I can simply visualize it already written  or could, if Id bothered to read the whole book and finish the DVD.)
 
But, drawing on some of Ehrenreichs other work, Id like to discuss they why of this book. The books success is easy enough to explain. As the Canadian publisher put it in an interview with the Toronto Star, Basically, human beings are lazy. If you tell them you can get rich just by thinking about it, obviously, theyre going to buy it.
 
But these books also have a more insidious effect. As Ehrenreich notes, by making your lack of wealth and a good job into personal problems, you discourage people from looking at the social systems that created and sustained those problems. By telling them their thoughts control the universe, you can persuade them to do things like  as one Secret-endorsing book encouraged  Place your hand on your heart and say  I admire rich people! I bless rich people! I love rich people! And Im going to be one of those rich people too!
 
And, in reverse, by telling people that bad things are caused by their negative thoughts, you get to persuade them to stop thinking about bad things. Im a really big believer in The Secret, a young black woman recently explained at a Secret-related book reading. But I also believe that discrimination and racism are real. How can you harmonize those things?
 
You just said you believe in discrimination, explained the guru. You be-live it. Im going to ask you to stop believing it, because if you focus on the negative, you project it yourself.
 
Thats right  if you stop believing in the existence of discrimination, itll stop happening to you. No need to fight to end it! Those black people banned from lunch counters in the South? They werent simply believing hard enough. Those studies showing that resumes with black-sounding names on them received far fewer callbacks as identical ones with white-sounding names? The researchers didnt take into account their thoughtwaves.
 
Following this idea goes to some pretty dark places and the authors take it all the way. I really love what youre doing, said a young man at the same event. But how, for example, was 9/11 attracted to the people in those buildings? Thats something I cant understand.
 
Sometimes, we experience the law of attraction collectively, explains the guru. The US maybe had a fear of being attacked. Those 3,000 people  they might have put out some kind of fear that attracted this to happen, fear of dying young, fear that something might happen that day. But sometimes, it is collective.
 
When you manage to convince people that even getting murdered is their own fault, youve truly found the secret of success. For the already powerful, that is.

I find your term absurd very interesting  telling that you dont even attempt to disprove The Secret. Because you cant. Your desire to disprove The Secret causes an attraction of lack of evidence to you. Obviously you must believe in The Secret for evidence of the truth of The Secret to be attracted to you. You are so closed-minded, not to mention arrogant. You think you are based on reason and evidence yet you cannot see that you have not and can never disprove The Secret.

The Secret is recycled dreck for the feeble-minded, but
 
I would assert that strongly held beliefs can open and close doors in our lives.  Actively changing beliefs can have very positive consequences.
 
I used to believe the world owed me a certain amount of success, happiness, and pleasure.  I actively rid myself of that belief, some doors leading to painful and futile behavior were closed, and some doors leading to fruitful and fulfilling thoughts and activity were opened.
 
I now believe (decided to believe, and labor to believe) that the only thing worth calling free-will is action that takes a person away from comfort, to the edge of a persons comfort zone and a measured bit beyond, in a direction informed by communication with the person I feel I should be, 5 to 10 years in the future (my future higher self).  Obviously, I also have to believe I have ability to communicate with a future self, one that shares my personal history, but has broken through some of my current limitations.
 
For example, I contemplate my limited access to the facts of my past, since it is mainly only available to me through imperfect human recollection.  Contemplating this limited access makes communicating with my future self through a temporal haze seem less fantastic.  And other mental exercises like this.  (Another example: imagining a dialog with myself as I was 5 years ago, as preparation for a third actor to join the dialog, myself 5 years in the future.)
 
Now I will quickly play devils advocate for the examples you gave.
 
I admire rich people! I bless rich people! I love rich people!
 
It is possible despising rich people might make a person feel conflicted while working to provide outstanding value to customers in a capitalist arena.  You would lose the edge to work hard to provide outstanding value, and you would then miss the opportunity to be financially rewarded (with outstanding renumeration).
 
But I also believe that discrimination and racism are real.
 
Believing that discrimination and racism were purely imagined might give a young black woman the courage to put her whole talents for display, because she will be unafraid that they will be rejected because she is black.  When she is rewarded (probably less than a white man would be rewarded, but still rewarded), her gains are very real, and they will also give her more courage to push further.  But those real gains came from believing a falsehood.
 
(I will skip the 9/11 example, because it is as thickly stupid as a migraine.  My ability to play devils advocate only stretches so far.)
 
My point is that individuals can sometimes gain individual success by denying social truths.
 
My point is that the strategies for individual success and strategies for success for a whole social/economic group (a traditionally disadvantaged group), those two types of strategies frequently class, if not absolutely clash.
 
What I see as a typical reason: individual success is often based on value creation; success for a whole social/economic group is often political and based on re-partitioning finite wealth and so is zero-sum.
 
I am leading to a question.  I dont remember ever reading an answer to this question.
 
Is there any way to reconcile individual gain and social/economic gain for a disadvantaged group?  Any way besides applying fractions of ones energies?  (I will spend 40% of my energy on political solutions, and 40% of my energy on value creation, and the remaining 20% enforcing partitions in my life to deal with the frequent clashes of identity.  With some task switching algorithm so that neither is short-changed, and I get maximal effectiveness from the fractional energy.)
 
Surely the golden middle will have some of ones energies toward the political, and some of ones energies toward value creation, and necessarily some of ones energies toward maintaining identity through contradictions of thought and activity (and some energy going towards task switching and effective time allocation).  But nobody seems to talk about working on applying this allotment of energies thoughtfully and systematically.  Nobody I ever remember reading.
 
Unless you are talking about the outrageously wealthy spending money, spending money only in their later years, spending money that has no risk of diminishing their standard of living, and spending money on a limited number of social goals (absolutely no social goals that put the current power distribution at risk).
 
(Sidenote: are value creation and political activism really in conflict?  Activities that satisfy both simultaneously seem to be few.  Surely, the world could not support hundreds of thousands of stimulating, provoking, readable political essayists.  I am also interested in learning more activities that simultaneously create value and promote a worth political cause.  Are they numerous enough to engage a whole citizenry?)
 
Why is an ordinary person with active value creation goals and active political goals so invisible?  My guess is that such a person working to such a mixture of goals would be a very strange bird.  And this person would be maximally politically useless and maximally politically inconvenient.  There would be absolutely no political gain (anywhere to anybody) from promoting such a way of living ones life.

I see nothing wrong with any effort that convinces people to take responsibility for their own lives.
 
To blame everyone but oneself for ones problems, or to spend ones life trying to remove the mote from a neighbors eye while ignoring the beam in ones own, simply perpetuates the most vicious of vicious circles. Resentment begets resentment.
 
Yes, people do suffer innocently. There is racism. There is terrorism. There is crime. But the only sufferings that matter are the sufferings of the soul, and these can only be self-inflicted. Our own wickedness is what we should fear, not that of others. This is the message of most of the worlds spiritual traditions, both secular and sacred.
 
Books like The Secret may not be sophisticated, but they are saying nothing more than what the wise have always known. Sophistication usually does more to delay the coming of wisdom than to hasten it; the wise have always known that, too.

Note:  I agree with your general take that the premise of the Secret is absurd.  But, like many of these phenomena there is a small grain of truth which can be dredged from it all.  The essential ideas, which can be found more transparently and eloquently said elsewhere, are the following:
 
1) Goal focus is important - those with particular and explicit goals in mind tend to succeed at those goals more than those who dont, simply because they devote their energies toward steps activities get them toward their goal. This is somewhat obvious, but it bears repeating, since many dont think in this manner.
 
2) Persistence is important - those who persist in a particular goal are more likely to achieve than those who dont, or who give up in the face of initial failures/setbacks.  Again, somewhat self evident, but worth explicitly stating.
 
3) Internal and External Self-confidence is important  to the extent that the secret gives individuals self-confidence, however falsely so, they are more likely to reach their goals if they believe in it and, more importantly, are able to convince others to believe in it to.  Achieving a particular goal requires the help of many others, and, consequently, the ability to persuade others that your ideas and goals are realistic and attainable. This Law of Attraction is sort of pseudo-babble proxy for increasing ones chance of internal and external self-confidence.
 
Now, I am not one who advocates engaging in self-deception merely to get certain beneficial outcomes (assuming that the above identified traits will result from the self-deceptive act of believing in the law of attraction).  This smacks of the argument that believing in god is good, even if untrue, because it causes individuals to behave more charitably.  But, then again, we all engage in self-deception to some degree.

The Self Help industry is the opiate of the masses.
 
Theres a new documentary series from Adam Curtis on how our concept of freedom has changed in the west from WW2 to the present. It goes some way to drawing out the context for the rise of the self help industry. Its called The Trap.
 
It seems to be available on GoogleVideo. Youre looking for 3 one hour segments. If it disappears, try archive.org. Several older Curtis docs are available there. (Power of Nightmares: the politics of fear is a personal favourite.)

Jacob: People make certain kinds of thinking errors that are well-understood, but unfortunately understanding them doesnt help much (a little, but not a whole lot). Look up behavioral finance for one examination, which is applying congitive psychology to what people actually do in investing.
 
Some very bad things come from combining
 
1) The propensity to see pattern in randomness
2) Over-estimation of abilities (everyone thinks theyre above average).
 
So you get lottery-like outcomes, with a few big winners, lots of participants losing everything, and instead of saying Its a lottery. Maybe we should organize society more evenly, they say Think happy thoughts about winning the lottery. Think real real hard about it.
 
Some of this comes from the fact that the big winners then get to hire clever people to push the idea of Lottery winners deserve it, and how you can be one too. And so theres a feedback effect there. But the big problem is that even knowing the thinking problem doesnt give you much of handle on how to approach dealing with it on a societal level.

I agree completely. The point isnt the worthiness of their goals.  Its a much simpler point  almost too self-evident to state  those who have goals, and focus their energies toward those goals tend to achieve those goals more than those who dont.
 
If somebodys goal is financial wealth, the person who single-mindedly devotes their energy toward becoming an investment banker as a means of achieving wealth is more likely to be wealthy than a person who haphazardly hopes for wealth.
 
This is ultimately a different question from whether the goals themselves are worthy.  I agree that many super goal-oriented individuals are doggedly pursuing goals that I dont consider very meaningful.  However, everyones preferences are individualized, so what is right for me is not necessarily right for others.
 
Thus, to the extent we can draw any wisdom out of the Secret, this is one  if you have a particular goal, youre more likely to achieve that goal by pursuing it actively, and letting people know that you are pursuing this goal.
 
Not a very compelling point, but it does seem to underlie the premise of the movie.

To gauge the lameness of any self-help offer, just look to see if they equate happiness with the accumulation of money. The more money they imply youll get, and the faster youll get it, the lamer the offer.
 
Likewise any offer that tells you youll get something because you deserve it.
 
There are certainly some people who can really benefit from breaking out of personal or societal bonds that hamper them. But for most people, the real secret to being happy is to decide to be happy.

WOW!!!
Who cares about who believes in the secret or anything else for that matter! The good opinion of people just does not matter. Who are they anyway? Nobody and every body. If any person has to give a belief in anything to the public it is because of their own fears. Do not take anyones opinion except as worthless, just believe in yourself. Useless and meaningless opinions are a set up to put you down, useful and good opinions should lift you up, and these people who are negative by nature and should be avoided.
 
If I lived in the year 1850 and told a story about wavelengths of energy creating images in my minivan navigating me through the world on a system created called GPS. That would be so absurd to these people and even the language I would use or even a photograph of the automobile would look like an abstract painting. They could not understand what they see with their limited understanding of creation.
 
The people who have anything negative to say about the secret have a limited understanding in their minds of what is the future. The fears they hold and the ways they know are under attack and their fear of the possibilities of our future being so simple is threatening them and their limited minds and belief systems. They just do not know of what they speak and that is why the speak and live in criticism and fear.
 
I do not believe Christ was anymore than any of us but I do not say that Christ or Catholicism is not true. My opinion in that matter just does not matter to anyone and should not. So let it be said that what matters the most is what you believe in. Do not share with the negative world a positive way of life. Hard work is whose law? I see many people who work very little for lots of money. I see lots of people work very hard for little money. Money favors no person, nor can money give love. So believe in the secret and dont believe in the secret, just keep it to yourself and know that if someone has to give their opinion do not believe them because they are coming from a hollow and painful place that when they speak their main purpose is to put you down and seeing you fail is their goal.

Aaron - youre bang on with your criticism of the Secret. Im appalled by how many people have bought into it. Thats why I wrote The Happy Neurotic: How Fear and Angst Can Lead to Happiness and Success http://www.thehappyneurotic.com
 
The premise is that you can be productive, happy and well-adjusted while remaining as neurotic as ever. I think fear and angst are great motivators. The belief that negativity will bring down terrible karma on your sorry ass is totally misguided. If you use your fear to motivate you to take action you can do amazing things.
 
Many self-help books promise us wealth, perfect health, and even to reverse the aging process if only we love ourselves, say positive affirmations, and eliminate all negativity. But most of us arent getting any richer, healthier or younger, and were starting to feel like idiots as we go around chanting, I am a perfect being of love and light while cutting people off in traffic.
 
Keep up the great work.

Quantum physics is real  A thought does birth action in your body.  Good thoughts bring good feelings and actions thus good health (less stress) and a higher success rate if you so desire.  The Universe does not listen but in a sense, it feels.  Although a grain of sand we are, so thus is a quark to an atom.  But, then I ask, what binds it all?  Energy, yes?  Ay, theres the rub.  The Universe feels I think.  Energy is its tentacles.
 
I cannot say that The Secret is true or not.  All I know is that when I was told passionately by my friend about it, I felt really good and I accomplished more goals and started new ones with fervor.  One can not judge this just by a movie (perhaps that is why you are disturbed, because they made money off of people buying it?), but must try for themselves.  But if you do not believe, then you will not know.
 
If we are to deny truths but have only beliefs then we will never advance as a society to any level but only digress.
 
We will know more and see more in the future when we are ready for it.  I have hope that you will as well.

Title: Newspeak
 
It started way back in the eighties, with the Stay Free maxi-pads. At least, thats what they said on this TV documentary I saw once. How could you tell people to protect their freedom when they thought you were talking about feminine hygiene products? I mean, you still had the words, of course, it wasnt Orwellian or anything, they didnt take away the words, they just added new meanings to them. Particular kinds of meanings. And who really wanted to use them after that? It made the whole idea of freedom seem kind of dirty.
 
We dont have freedom either, of course. Freedom lasted a little longer, before finally dying out in the late nineties when the name was taken by that pornography download software. I mean, try telling some guy in the street youre just trying to protect your freedom. Ive tried! He laughs and then he makes some sort of obscene sexual pantomime. Makes it kind of hard to be an activist.
 
Activist took a little longer. Companies bought out the core concepts before they moved to the little stuff like us activists. Activist was what they called it when they privatized the sewer system in the late 2000s. Activists are shit, you used to hear the right-wingers say. Now they dont even need to say it  its in the dictionary.
 
So when I recruit kids I cant tell them what theyd be. Saying theyd be activists is straight out, obviously. But I cant even tell them we do protests. Protest is what they call it when you call AAA when your car breaks down. Kids dont want to go around fixing broken cars. Theyre not big on protests.
 
Liberty quickly became the leading brand of thong underwear. Control is the #2 online role-playing game. Rights are the new name for gift certificates. Democracy is the kind of M&Ms where you get to pick the color. (Geez man, we all like chocolate, but youre taking things a bit too far, is what the kids say when I tell them we need to fight to protect democracy.)
 
Its like a nightmare version of Intelligence (or, as it used to be called, Wheel of Fortune). They bought up all my words.

But they do detract from old uses. When the new common definition replaces the old, you lose control of your own language. You lose a bit of capacity for communication. You lose control of your own argument. Outside of physical or legal suppression, is there anything more demeaning to a community?

Surely meaning is nothing more than a social contract? Its only a set of agreed rules controlled implicitly by usage, and usage of language is carried out by community and society. Its a collective activity. Thus if the will of the community is to change the meaning of a word, then the members have to keep up with it, or work to maintain the canonical status of their meaning. Only way I can see round this is if valuable meanings are lost - but if theyre not the ones the majority of people want, then we have to have rules about who in which minorities should be able or allowed to define value of meaning, and it seems like were on the slippery slope to technocracy. Which isnt necessarily a good or bad thing, but which is quite hard to defend ethically in the context of the current libertarian and individualist climate.

Title: This Television Life
 
Have you ever listened to that show on NPR, This American Life? I dont know about you, but as far as Im concerned, it has to be one of the most amazing things to ever grace our countrys airwaves. Back when it started, over a decade ago now, it was unlike just about anything you heard on public radio. This wasnt a show about news or music or comedy. It wasnt even, really, a show about people. It was a show about stories, stripped down to their pure essence, people talking to you with a little bit of music in the background.
 
Humans seem to have a natural craving for stories. Whatever the topic, its more fun to hear a story about it. Everyone tells stories. Everyone tells stories, but some people love crafting them until theyre perfect, like little pastries of information with curves in all the right places. And thats what This American Life did each week on the radio: it presented three or four perfectly-crafted stories, all tangentially related to one loose theme, to your car or home for one full hour.
 
A couple years ago the Showtime network called Ira Glass, the head and host of This American Life and asked him if he wanted to make a television version of his show. For most people, getting a call from a television network would be a fairly big deal. But not Glass. Every week, his radio show is heard by 1.6 million people. A hit show on Showtime gets half a million. So Glass said no, there was no way their show would work on television. Still, Showtime persisted, asking what it would take to make it work. So Glass thought of every crazy demand that came to mind. And Showtime met them all.
 
The result, which premieres tonight on the pay-cable Showtime network, has to be one of the most amazing things to grace American television. It is unlike just about anything youve ever seen on TV. The best way I can think to describe it is this: Have you ever seen one of those stock photo movies? You know, the kind with the lusciously oversaturated colors, weird landscapes, and slow-motion movements? The kind of footage that makes the normal world look magical? Now, take that, and imagine an entire television show made out of it. Its absolutely incredible.
 
To promote the show, since Showtime isnt exactly, This American Life went on a six-city tour. I caught them in Chicago, where a jam-packed crowd of dedicated fans (still pissed about the team moving to New York to film the TV show) came to hear What I Learned From Television. We were in the Chicago Theater, a local landmark that holds thousands. And, I have to say, its probably the most fun Ive ever had in a theater.
 
You know how on the radio show, they do these incredibly moving stories that just send chills of emotion down your spine. Now imagine listening to that, in the middle of a crowd of thousands of people who all came out to hear the very same thing. I mean, these were people who cheered individual names in the credits at the end of the show. (Well miss you Elizabeth Meister!) Ive never felt a room so charged with emotion before.
 
So do these guys a favor. Do yourself a favor. Take your Nielsen box and switch it to Showtime tonight at 10:30. Itll be like nothing youve ever felt before.

the KPF* family of stations (Im familiar with L.A. and San Francisco, not sure if theyre elsewhere) used to have a series by a man with the name Joe Frank.  He had a new show most weeks with some light music in the background and told a number of stories.  It gets really interesting because sometimes the stories have a point, sometimes they seem to offer a point but derail right before they get there, leaving you wondering.  Sometimes its just prose about whats going on in his life (for about 3 months he described a prolonged breakup he was going through).  It sounds similar to what youre talking about and theres a wealth of material available if you can find it, but it may take some searching.

Title: How Quantum Mechanics is Compatible with Free Will
 
The actions of almost everything in this world are causally determined by the state of the world that precedes them. Once you start a machine, if no one touches it, its behavior can be predicted entirely in advance from the laws of physics. When you drop a pen down a well, it is physically necessary that it fall.
 
But our behavior doesnt feel that way. When we stick out our tongue it feels as if we had to specifically choose to stick it out, that this was our own action and not a predetermined consequence of the existing state of the world.
 
Some people argue that because the evidence for determinism is so overwhelming, free will must simply be an illusion. But if so, it is a very odd kind of illusion. Most illusions result from a naive interpretation of our senses. For example, in a classic illusion, two drawings of equal size appear to be of different size. But when we are told this is an illusion, we can correct for it, and behave under the new (more accurate) impression that the drawings are in fact of equal size.
 
This simply isnt possible with free will. If someone tells you that you do not actually have free will but have actually been acting under an illusion, you cannot sit back and let determinism take over. When the waiter asks you whether you like soup or salad, you cannot say Oh, well Ive just learned that free will is an illusion and all my actions are completely determined by the previous state of the world, so Ill just let them play themselves out. I mean, you can say that, but the waiter will look at you like youre crazy and you will get neither soup nor salad.
 
It seems overwhelmingly bizarre that evolution would have given us this strangest of illusions. This is not a spandrel, a small place evolution never had time to be concerned about. The illusion of free will affects all aspects of our lives and takes an enormous amount of work. One would think evolution would have eliminated it were it genuinely false.
 
So what is the other possibility? The other possibility is that not all actions are entirely determined by the preexisting state of the world. And, in fact, recent advances in physics seem to show this is somewhat the case. Quantum mechanics suggests that at some fundamental level there is randomness involved in the laws of the world. And chaos theory shows us that small amounts of randomness in a system can have real large-scale effects.
 
So, although it seems extremely improbable, if we have to avoid the improbability of evolution not breeding out an illusory free will, then were forced to look to the randomness of quantum mechanics for an explanation.
 
But, some argue, this is insufficient. Quantum mechanics only gives us randomness  but free will isnt just the pursuit of random behavior, its the pursuit of particular behaviors. While quantum mechanics cant predict each individual bit, it does give overall probability distributions. Volitional behaviors would wreak havoc with those even distributions.
 
Not true. Imagine the simple case where we have one quantum bitstream: a series of zeroes and ones, in which each individual number cannot be predicted, but theres an overall law saying that roughly half of them will be one and half will be zero. And let us simplify the system to say that if the result of the quantum effect is 0 then the person moves left, and if its 1 they move right. In the naive scenario, free will affects this quantum bitstream so that when the person wants to move left the randomness keeps coming up zeroes. But that would violate the laws of physics  the results would no longer be half ones and half zeroes.
 
So heres the trick: first, the system gets a random bit from some other source. Then it adds the bit from the other source with the bit from the quantum bitstream and uses the result to decide if you move left or right. Now, when you want to continually move left, half the time youll have to make the quantum bitstream return zeroes and the other half the time ones  exactly what the laws of quantum mechanics require.
 
With a little additional mathematical complexity, the scenario is generalizable to much more complicated quantum functions and human results. But the basic principle is the same: one can use quantum randomness to exercise free will without violating any statistical laws.
 
Of course, this still leaves one key problem. What is picking the results of this quantum bitstream? And how does it do it? I have to admit I cannot really think of a sensible way. But this seems like a problem for neurobiology to figure out and report back to us. I merely aim to prove that its doing so is consistent with what we know about the laws of physics.

Sounds like youve stumbled upon the same concept Roger Penrose pushes in the last chapter of his book The Emperors New Mind. I recommend the book because its a great examination of many really neat cross-disciplinary concepts, but in my opinion (and I think most peoples) it goes into the weeds when he starts trying to show that quantum randomness can account for human consciousness. As I recall he doesnt claim to even come up with a theory of how that might be, he just tries to show that it might be possible to formulate such a theory. I think Shadows of the Mind does the same but I havent read that.
 
I really dont see the need to try to show that anyway. You write:
 
The illusion of free will affects all aspects of our lives and takes an enormous amount of work. One would think evolution would have eliminated it were it genuinely false.
 
First of all, Im not sure how one could measure the amount of work that an incrementally-more-conscious mind requires. Work is traditionally expressed in terms like caloric expenditure and time requirements. Did you mean that literally?
 
Also, evolution only eliminates genes that are detrimental to the genes propagation. Many falsehoods are beneficial to organisms. For example, humans are predisposed to believe falsehoods about gods that watch over us. (Proving this is trivial: most humans have such belief; most such beliefs are incompatible with the others; at most, one compatible set can be true; therefore, the other belief sets are false.)
 
But is religion harmful? Since it promotes group cooperation, and since were a species that can gain strong benefits from group action, theres no reason to think it is; quite the opposite.
 
Personally I think the illusion of a conscious free will evolved like most other beneficial mutations: incrementally, unplanned of course, and probably quite to the surprise of anyone who would have been watching! Its not hard to imagine how the components came together. An organism whose time flows in one direction will benefit from a brain that remembers the past, looks toward the future, and participates in the present. By conceiving of itself making decisions on a moment-to-moment basis it will best adapt to linear time. Crying out in pain when injured may have initially benefited an organism by inspiring nearby group members to assist, but in a species that lies and unmasks lies, sincerity of pain, feeling it deeply, will inspire the desired response more effectively. A mindset that includes the illusion of the self will have the principle evolutionary advantage of using higher brain functions for self-preservation over the long-term (months), not just the short-term (minutes). Members of a social species will benefit from modeling the mindsets of other individuals; the mental apparatus to put oneself in anothers place is probably very similar to that of envisioning oneself as a conscious entity.
 
In short, I suspect for the particular kind of animal we were x million years ago, the evolutionary mutations that reinforced the illusion of a self were beneficial, while those that weakened this illusion were harmful. In principle (though I dont know how with todays science) the genes and mental apparatus that construct this illusion could be measured. By words like you and me, we refer to this complex illusion that the clockwork machinery was evolved to harbor.
 
Would you like to know what its like to be a collection of self-preserving atoms evolved to appear sincere, to be sincere, to feel deeply, to think of itself as a conscious entity, to behave as though it were a singular actor? Look around you.

The other other possibility is that free will hasnt been eliminated simply because its a useful thing for people to believe in. Without a sense of free will, perhaps minds as we understand them simply could not exist?
 
In other words, its an illusionary comfort blanket, but a necessary one.
 
I suspect this is the case; given that there is no evidence that I am aware of for free will, it seems disingenuous to desperately search for explanations that allow it. It feels rather like people trying to prove the bible by hunting for the Ark or the True Cross; those who believe one way or the other are unlikely to be swayed by any evidence that is found.

Youve proved (some of) the beliefs are false, but not that were predisposed to them.
 
Your evolutionary theory only explains a sense-of-self, it doesnt explain the illusion of free will. And while Ill admit I havent formalized the cost of free will (doing so will require some hard thinking) I think the simple strength of the illusion is sufficient to make it a hypothesis worth pursuing, even if fantastically unlikely.

Consider a maze-solving automaton, that is programmed to find its way through a maze using some complicated heuristics, and suppose there are no random numbers involved.
 
Given a maze and knowledge of the algorithm, we can predict what the program will do.  So in that sense its predetermined.  But the fact that it is predetermined is of no particular use to the programmer making up the heuristics, so there would be no need to try to somehow represent that metaknowledge in the heuristics.
 
Similarly, if our actions are predetermined, it would do us no good to have an intimate awareness of that.  Consciousness would be a painful hell if you were saddled with the feeling of just observing your life and having no choice about what you did next.  Im not sure that kind of consciousness would even be possible  you wouldnt have any reason to identify with the body you were apparently riding around in.

Perhaps youve heard of Benjamin Libets readiness potential experiments?

These seem to show that the decision to move is made, in some cases, a large fraction of a second before a person believes theyve made such a decision.  This argues very strongly against free will having any particular role in actions taken on the spur of the moment.  Since such decisions can be experimentally shown to be illusory, why would a completely different real choice mechanism underlie decisions which appear internally to be identically chosen?

Dammit! Free will is not incompatible with determinism! It is (IMHO) incompatible with indeterminism!
 
Think about it: what do we mean when we say that I chose to eat the chocolate cake? We mean that I was responsible for it. There was something about my mind that caused me to choose the chocolate cake. Now, under determinism, my choosing the cake is directly dependent on my current mental states. They determine my future mental states. My current mental states are my mind, so its fair to say, My mind determines my decisions.
 
Under the quantum mechanics as key to consciousness interpretation, what determines my future mental states? Random static. So, who is responsible for my choices? No one. So, this interpretation actually strips responsibility for my actions away from me and gives it to a coin flip! I want my future choose to rest on me, dammit, not something I dont have any effect on!
 
At any rate, real quantum mechanics is not about randomness at all. Its about how randomness turns out to be really, really regular and predictable, such that if you do a statistically significant number of things, the quantum fuzz all cancels out. So, quantum mechanics is just a mostly deterministic mechanism but with a small margin of error that usually doesnt affect anything significant.
 
Free will as it is often used in public discourse is a contradictory concept. If we give it the provisional definition, my mental states are responsible for my voluntary thoughts and actions, I dont see how there is any contradiction between saying, my brain is responsible for my actions, and, the laws of physics are responsible for my brains actions. Yes, my brain, like the pen falling down the well, is just doing what it naturally will do, but that no more lets my actions come about without my thoughts causing them than a pen could hit a rock at the bottom of a well without the pen itself being the thing that hits the rock.
 
Look at the running of a computer program. Saying I am not responsible for my thoughts because of determinism is like saying that a computer program is not responsible for its output. Certainly, what the computer outputs is naturally a result of what the computer gets in, but also, crucially, what the computer outputs rests on how the program itself responds to the input!

Youre getting there, but not there yet. The embryologic program seems to be that some number of pre-neural cells develops and then a critical concentration of some chemical product is produced which causes them to convert to neurons and start extending dendrites and axons to their neighbors. The randomness comes from all the physical input from mom: did she eat radishes for dinner that increased her blood pH for a bit that just delayed the conversion event for another hour while a couple more pre-neurons divided? Did she sleep on her left or her right? Did the embryo implant higher up or further down in the uterus? On the left or the right? Twins? All these things can have tiny little effects on the initial conditions for the neural system.
 
Also, the neural system is a sort of, Im not sure  if its best thought of as an A/D converter or a variable-base logic gate (base two, base three, base 87, etc). See, one neuron reaches out and touches many neighbors. So all the neuron bodies are touched by many neighbors. This is part of the initial conditions, but also part of the reinforcement function. Use it or loose it is a deep principle of neurobiology: if a connection isnt used, then it shrivels and dies. Connections are selected for their utility. Youve got to think about neurobiology, the seat of free will, from the neurons perspective. The brain is a macro manifestation of biology.
 
How do the neurons transmit signals? They release synaptic vesicles, little bubbles full of neurotransmitter subtances, typically glutamate or GABA, but there are modulation subsystems that use dopamine, serotonin, enkaphalins, etc. The vesicles release their contents into the tiny gap between the sending neuron and the receiving neuron, and some of the neurotransmitter molecules land on cell-surface receptors, which triggers the opening and closing of various ion channels on the cell surface, and so you get a voltage change. A little voltage change that dissipates with r^2. Think of ripples on a pond. If I drop rock after rock after rock after rock in quick succession, I build up bigger ripples on the surface. If several of us drop rocks at nearly the same time, the waters surface also get bigger ripples. If a sending neuron releases vesicle after vesicle after vesicle, eventually the sum builds up to an action potential: the receiving neuron sends its own signal down its axon to many other neurons. So too many sending neurons may simultaneously send a bunch of vesicles to the receiving neuron and it suddenly goes from quiescent to sending an action potential.
 
The threshold for an action potential is, eh, something in the vicinity of -25mV. The resting potential is, eh, say, -90mV. These things vary based on local conditions like temperature, pH, and the ion channels involved. Say each vesicle transmits enough neurotransmitter to induce a 2mV change in potential, and that effect decays to near 0 in 1 microsecond. So at a minimum, we need 13 vesicles to be released withing about a microsecond to get the receiving neuron to fire. More likely, well get 30 over 2 microseconds, or maybe one of the vesicles is norepinephrine so we only need 30 over 7 microseconds.
 
Anyway, what happens is you get both spatial and temporal summation of these little bits of input. Its not quantum like quantum mechanics, but they are in fact called quantal potentials. And quantum mechanics is still very much at play: effecting how quickly neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic gap (formally the synaptic cleft), exactly how many ions go through each ion channel while its open, etc, etc.
 
So theres a quantum bitstream, but its neurochemical quanta, not electronic quanta. And theres not just one, theres a lot of them. The randomness is induced by the environment, which is itself a quantum mechanical system with some locales where self-organizing, self-replicating chemical systems that predictably coalesced.
 
Whats really cool is that Vintner just published a paper, well, the scientists who work for him published a paper, about DNA he acquired by dipping water out of the middle of the ocean. See, theres no reason to believe the self-organizing, self-replicating system only occured once. Its in fact much more likely that a statistically possible phenomenon occurs many, many times. What they found was that most of the DNA in the samples matched nothing they have ever sequenced. Totally novel microbial DNA. All over the place.

I need to correct my statement above: if the resting potential is -90 mV and the threshold for an action potential is -25 mV, and each quantal potential is 2 mV, then you need at least 33 quantal potentials, 33 vesicles of neurotransmitter, to arrive almost simultanously, not 13. (90-25)/2=32.5.

Aaron,
 
Im usually in greater agreement with you than not, but I fear that this essay trips and falls.  Quantum mechanics doesnt prove anything about free will one way or the other, in any but the most dubious interpretations.
 
Many of the simplest interpretations - like MWI - permit or even insist on determinism, though its often a higher-order kind of determinism.  For example, adopting a strict and infinite MWI position:  the fact that you think you have free will is then merely a function of the fact that the reality you find yourself in, in all probability, is the one which is consistent with the choices you think you made.  That you think you made those choices in this slice of causal reality is independent of all the other choice / belief / causality configurations your infinitely extended self holds.  If you indeed occupy the extended phase space of all possibilities you could could ever face, then free will becomes a less-than-useful, even nonsensical idea.
 
As Im sure you well know, the interpretation of the meaning of the wave function and its collapse is highly susceptible to abuse by non-scientists and scientists alike.  Its becoming quite the trendy epidemic to invoke quantum reasoning in metaphysical / philosophical / psychological mumbo-jumbo-filled bloviations.  (Ive done it myself in the past, and I regret it.)
 
Dont feed the animals. ;-)  Insist on rigor when discussing science.

Well like you say What is picking the results of this quantum bit stream? And how does it do it?, indeed.  I think we need to define a process, call it you, and prove that the volition to do something is determined by that process.  This you process must be able to supervene on the deterministic universe, otherwise you dont have free will.  It all comes down to proving that tricky relationship called supervene.  You can read more about that relationship in The Conscious Mind by David Chalmers.  The advantage of formulating the question this way is that you dont need to rely upon the quantum world and some unknown mechanism to justify a belief in free will, because the you process can supervene on any mechanism, whether it be quantum or neurological or  social or a combination of all of those.  The only requirement is that the you process determines the volition and can supervene on the physics of the real universe.

Quantum mechanics only gives us randomness
 
I think quantum mechanics gives us less than that.
 
We have no way (no deterministic way) to describe why individual particles exhibit wavelike behavior.  A probability distribution is the closest match to what we observe in the lab.  Thats basic quantum mechanics (the math behind the probability distributions).
 
There are other postulates (Heisenbergs principle) which claim the basic nature of reality is irreducible from such probability distributions.  Thats a whole new claim.
 
Im not so sure the claim is true.  Before Newtons laws of motion were known, you couldnt predict the outcome of a flipped coin - you could flip 100 coins and make a decent probability distribution.  A person before Newton might strongly believe that the result of a single coin flip was fundamentally unpredictable.
 
Suppose a deterministic explanation for quantum mechanics was discovered - a way to exactly calculate the individual actions that, in aggregate, produced the probability distributions described by quantum mechanics.
 
Would quantum mechanics still be compatible with free will?

I have a book (ISBN 0-13-165945-6) that suggests free will is an illusion; using a computer-science complexity argument.
 
Like a computer of finite speed your mind has not enough capacity to simulate itself in real time (the circuits used for the simulation necessarily being somewhat less than the whole).  Hence possible determinism while being unable to know your own future.

I have to agree with the no-free-willers Im afraid. Its not surprising you have to introduce some other source to get your free will picture right. Basically I think it doesnt make THAT much of a difference whether you affect the quantum bitstream directly or add to it from some other source. Without this other source, presumably an agent or what religious people call soul, theres no free will. Of course one cannot COMPLETELY rule out we have free will, but that put aside, would it really be so bad not to have it? I say no. Without free will, one can still live AS IF one had free will because often the concept simply tends to make life less complicated. However, one should know that there is not really any such thing as ultimate responsibility for ones actions, which can free you from or at least alleviate guilt and shame as well as the ludicrous amounts of pride and arrogance many people display with regard to their fantastic accomplishments. Im sorry if any anti-free will stuff disheartens people who want to believe in free will. In most cases though, as with religious people, they make up for the lack of evidece with an extra big portion of confidence. Thats why outside the internet, in real life, Im a hard determinist in the closet. And I dont intend to come out any time soon.

Free will is free, not because it contradicts physical determinism, but because it contradicts psychological determinism. By psychological determinism, I mean the assumption that a person will always do whatever they want to do in that particular moment. Thus there is a conflict between two opposing forces in the brain, one representing desire, and the other representing willpower. Neither of these opponents always prevails.
 
On the one hand, if desire always prevailed, then we would be just like other animals. (Assuming that non-human animals have no willpower is probably an oversimplification, as there is evidence to suggest that some of our closer relatives sometimes exert their own willpower.).
 
On the other hand, if willpower always prevailed, then our behaviour would too readily become disconnected from biology.
 
The exact rules for deciding which force prevails and which doesnt may be rather complex, and determining what those rules are is equivalent to solving the problem of what free will is.
 
I have written up more of my thinking on this subject at http://www.1729.com/consciousness (including an article Why Roger Penrose is Wrong, which might be of interest to some of the other commenters here).

Anyone that believes in chaos or randomness is a fool. By no means can something ever operate on its own. Without affecting things around it, without being affected by things around it. Come on, think about it! How can something be unlinked to the world? Because thats what it means to have random behavior. It means that there is nothing that causes the effect. The only reason to call something random is simply because we do not know what the causes for the effect are, but thats pretty darn far away from having no causes at all.
 
Free will is not an illusion, nor do we have any free will. The only reason we think we have a free will is simply because we do not know all causes for the effects that sums up our actions. You can train yourself on this matter. When a thought strikes you, ask yourself where it came from. Wasnt it that sign I walked past a minute ago that triggered a memory that was associated with another memory.etc. Do it. Youll be surprised how soon youll get to know your brain, what really triggers you. Of course, you can only scratch the surface this way.
 
OK, so if there is a cause for every effect, then we could find the ultimate reason, right? The one reason that set it all off. No, because the Universe is infinite. Deal with it.

The example you gave, that one cant give up making referents to oneself and stating intentionality, does not serve as an illustration of free will.
 
First, its an artifact of English that one must always use a first person pronoun. Second, we exist in a cultural milieu that is utterly dependent upon  the maintenance of a cultural sense of free agency; Restaurants themselves are a construct of the enlightenment.
 
You are presumably aware of the wide variation between what a person can report as their intentionality and the actual processes involved; singular examples, like people with certain types of neuronal damage, and those individuals who had their corpus callosum severed in order to prevent their epileptic fits, illustrate that our narrative of self-hood is only in loose association with what is going on.
 
The complexity of the process by which people select among their behaviours and actions for those that they will include in their sense of self never fails to amaze me in its complexity, yet the evolutionary advantage of the ability to socially model others seems potent enough to explain why we choose to elevate the model of the monkey in the mirror to a state of some prominence.

What does chaos theory have to do with randomness? Fractals are completely deterministic, yet you still cant predict what any part will look like.
 
Determinism does not equal predictability. This whole debate seems pretty narrow-minded and pedestrian to me.
 
We know today that the way thinking works is roughly by firing neuron patterns that feed back until a signal has sufficiently self-amplified to cross a threshold. The brain is a pattern matcher driven by innumerable feedback loops  a boundlessly non-linear system.
 
So what if its deterministic? It wont do you any good to know that it is.

Interesting topic.  No need to speculate about this level of mechanism, there are good empirical approaches.
 
For example, we can build on this article about the detailed dynamics and neural mechanisms of changes in conscious perception.
 
They do this basically by setting up a situation in which they can observe, and to some extent control, extended shifts in how something looks to the subject.  They do this by layering two tricks.
 
The first trick is binocular rivalry.  If our two eyes see visually incompatible things, first one and then the other tends to dominate.  Normally ones perceptions switch spontaneously and somewhat unpredictably.
 
This phenomenon is especially relevant because much of the brain is actually processing the input from both eyes, but at some point only one or another input is passed on to consciousness.  (This has been determined by Logothetis through invasive experiments with monkeys.)
 
The second trick is to make the dominance switching much slower and more controllable.  The authors of the paper I cite did this by making the conflicting part of the image into a ring.  The switch then moves around the ring and takes a few seconds to complete.  Also, they found they could initiate a switch by changing the contrast momentarily at some spot on the ring  the change would then start at that spot and propagate.
 
Furthermore they found they could observe the change propagating in the brain, along a retintopic map, essentially a distorted version of the ring in part of the visual cortex.
 
They are able to accurately model the observed dynamics with a fairly straightforward neural network.
 
So is this relevant?  Yes, I think it is easy to transpose this pattern from spontaneous conscious perceptions to spontaneous conscious choices.
 
Suppose we have multiple evaluation processes operating at a unconscious or marginally conscious level.  Some might be converging on the same action, others on some competing action, etc.  Consciously, the options may seem to grow or shrink spontaneously until one displaces all the others, or until we get tired of thinking about the problem (also an outcome of a dynamic evaluation process).
 
The factors that create a sense of choosing are (1) the extended unconscious dynamics of competing evaluation processes and (2) the way the conscious manifestations of those processes can be affected but not fully controlled by attention.

Yeah, quantum consciousness and bit streams reek of what the bleep do we know?
 
I dont really see any reason to try preserving free-will anymore. It is a conclusion in search for evidence. Generally, people think of free-will as some agent being the pan-ultimate cause of their actions. That full knowledge of the present cannot lead to a 100% prediction of the future. Throwing in some QM randomness doesnt help it as now one controls that randomness.
 
Most evidence suggest approximate determinism for large systems like brains. The above usual definition of free will is not compatible with such determinism. Compatibalists like Hobbes and Dennet have their own definitions. Hobbes looks at how constrained and coerced an agents will feels. Dennet focuses on evitability of negate events (and presumedly ability to seek positive ones).
 
If you want free-will, it seems better to start with a new definition, rather than trying to salvage a concept that is refuted by all existing evidence. One of the few things I agree with Dennet on is what makes the pan-ultimate cause definition so great? Agents in a determined system are  not inherently less able to seek good things/avoid bad things than then those in a free-will universe.
 
As for responsibility, it is another dead end. I believe in prevention, which can include deterrents. But the idea of punishing anyone in what seems to be a determinist system is as silly as punishing a computer or a tree for not doing what you want. You might as well curse at the Laws of Physics. Why punish someone for stealing candy but not a retarded person for being annoying and stupid? I cant accept the later, but I cant take one without the other; I dont care for the whole concept. Responsibility and accountability may be useful words as heuristics for prevention however, but not real heavy-weight concepts.

Prescriptionists beware: the phrase me and  stands as a valid form and relieves the me of its being required to be in subjective form - me is not the subject of the sentence, me and the other mentors is.

Hate to belabo(u)r this seemingly trivial point, but
 
Are language usage issues to be decided by prescription or description? Largely the latter, particularly since the rules of the former are acknowledgedly based on the latter!
 
In the current brouhaha, the issue is whether the parts of a phrase used as a subject (me and others on the web) must, if pronouns, be of their subject form.
 
Stragely enough, what sounds right, although heavily dependent on context, is most often the final deciding vote in this matter. It is quite clear (at least to me and I suppose most descriptionists) that me and the other members will be looking has a more fitting sound in the current context than I and the other - and the comma before me and the other mentors makes it clear and makes it sound right.
 
Love.

Title: Hating John Searle
 
Title: 2 does not necessarily follow from #1, in a very deep reasons. A program which could pass the Turing Test might be too complex to write it down in a book in any practical sense. You cant even write it down in a book in practice all the software that runs a modern computer operating system - that is, the source code is just too huge. Sure, you can start playing games, and say its a big, big, book with tiny, tiny, fonts, but then that is just saying its information.
 
I think John Searle might be my favorite living philosopher. But when I tell my friends this, they recoil in horror. That bastard? one friend cries. He tripled my rent! Oh geebus, another cries. The Chinese Room argument is awful.
 
I will not profess to have an opinion on whether the fourteenth amendment requires the City of Berkeley to provide a rational basis for only allowing its landlords to raise rents at forty percent of the increase in the consumer price index, but I must admit I fail to see what the question has to do with Searle as a philosopher.
 
The other complaint seems less ad hominem, but I think is fundamentally similar. Reading Searles published books, its striking how little space the Chinese Room Argument takes up. Indeed, his book on the subject of consciousness  The Rediscovery of the Mind  gives it little more than a paragraph and notes that his more recent argument against functionalism is far more powerful.
 
Nonetheless, I will defend the Chinese Room Argument. The basic idea, for those who arent familiar with it, is this: imagine yourself being placed in a room and given instructions on how to convert one set of Chinese symbols to another. To outsiders, if the instructions are good enough, it will seem as if you understand Chinese. But you do not consciously understand Chinese  you are simply following instructions. Thus, no computer can ever consciously understand Chinese, because no computer does more than what youre doing  its simply following a set of instructions. (Indeed, being unconscious, its doing far less.)
 
The Chinese Room Argument works mainly as a forcing maneuver. There are only two ways out of it: you can either claim that no one is conscious or that everything is conscious. If you claim that no one is conscious, then there is no problem. Sure, the man doesnt consciously understand Chinese, but he doesnt consciously understand English either. However, I dont think anyone can take this position with a straight face. (Even Daniel Dennett is embarrassed to admit it in public.)
 
The alternative is to say that while perhaps the man doesnt consciously understand Chinese, the room does. (This is functionalism.) I think its pretty patently absurd, but Searle provides a convincing refutation. Functionalists argue that information processes lead to consciousness. Running a certain computer program, whether on a PC or by a man with a book or by beer cups and ping pong balls, will cause that program to be conscious. Searle points out that this is impossible; information processes cant cause consciousness because theyre not brute facts. We (conscious humans) look at something and decide to interpret it as an information process; but such processes dont exist in the world and thus cant have causal powers.
 
Despite the obvious weakness of the arguments, why do so many of my friends continue to believe in functionalism? The first thing to notice is that most of my friends are computer programmers. Theres something about computer programming that gets you thinking that the brain is nothing more than a special kind of program.
 
But once you do that, youre stuck. Because one property of computer programs is that they can run on any sort of hardware. The same program can run on your Mac or a PC or a series of gears and pulleys. Which means it must be the program thats important; the hardware cant be relevant. Which is patently absurd.
 
I used to think that part of the reason my friends believed this was because they had no good alternatives. But Ive since explained to them Searles alternative  consciousness is a natural phenomenon which developed through evolutionary processes and is caused by the actions of the brain in the same way solidity is caused by the actions of atoms  and it hasnt caused them to abandon their position one bit.
 
So I tried a different tack. I asked them what they thought was wrong with Searles position. And the answer always seems to come down to a confusion between ontology and epistemology. Ontology is a fancy word for the facts of the matter  what actually exists out in the world. And epistemology is the world for the way we know about it. Unless you subscribe to a bizarre philosophical theory, things in the world exist irrespective of whether we know them or not. Behind the TV game show door, there either is a car or there isnt, even if no one can see in to tell which one is the case. Furthermore, things continue to exist even if we cant even know them in principle. There appears to be no way for me to ever tell what it feels like for you to taste an orange; nonetheless, there is indeed something that it feels like for you.
 
My programmer friends argument always ends up coming down to this: if a computer program acted conscious, if it plaintively insisted that it was conscious, if it acted in all respects like the conscious people we know in the real world, then it must be conscious. How could we possibly tell if it was not? In short, they believe in the Turing Test as a test for consciousness  anything that acts smart enough to make us think its conscious must be conscious.
 
This was the position Ned Block was trying to refute when he postulated a computer program known as Blockhead. Blockhead is a very simple (although very large) computer program. It simply contains a list of all possible thirty minute conversations. When you say something, Blockhead looks it up in the list, and says whatever the list says its supposed to say next. (Obviously such a list would be unreasonably long in practice, perhaps even when heavily compressed, but let us play along theoretically.)
 
Having a conversation with Blockhead would be just like having a conversation with a real person. But nobody could seriously claim the program was conscious, right? Well, in fact they do.
 
One wonders whether these people think their cell phones are conscious. After all, talking to a properly-enabled cell phone works just like talking to a properly-enabled person! (I asked one friend this and his response was that the whole system containing the cell phone and the wires and the person on the other end was conscious.)
 
The point is that we dont assign consciousness purely based on behavior. Blockhead acts like its conscious and a completely paralyzed person acts like theyre not, yet we all know that the first isnt conscious and the second is. Instead, we assign consciousness based on causes. We know dogs are conscious because we know they have brains that are very much like ours which cause behavior very much like ours. We dont make that judgment based on behavior alone.
 
Criticisms aside, what is the positive argument for John Searle? First, he has done important work in a wide variety of fields. As far as I can tell, he began following up the works of his teachers (like J. L. Austin) on the topic of speech acts, which he generalized to the subject of intentionality, which he solved by saying it was a property of conscious beings, which led him to develop a theory of consciousness. Second, all of his points seem quite reasonable to me and (with a few exceptions) I agree with them. Third, he writes extremely clearly and entertainingly and for a popular audience.
 
These three seem like a fairly low bar  theyre about what I would expect from myself were I a philosopher  but its shocking how few prominent philosophers seem to meet them. Daniel Dennett is a dreadfully prolix writer and is insane. Thomas Nagel comes close but is a fairly committed dualist. Hilary Putnam doesnt write for a popular audience. Peter Singer doesnt seem to develop any actual theories. So I cant think of any. Can you? Suggestions appreciated in the comments.

There are only two ways out of it: you can either claim that no one is conscious or that everything is conscious
 
Third way: consciousness is a VARIABLE, not a BINARY.
 
That is, everything is conscious is like everything has a temparature - theres a range from 0 to a very high level. Were predisposed to read everything is conscious like everything is hot, which sounds absurd, but thats just because of language usage.
 
I would say a lot of trouble is hidden in the words given instructions on how to convert one set of Chinese symbols to another. It may be that this turns out to mean something like a conscious mind, or access to one in some manner in practice. That is, its not really an argument, but a tautology, basically another artifact of non-rigorous language (i.e, circularly arguing that its a mere set of instructions, and minds are taken to be much more glorious than a set of instructions, so if a set of instructions can do what a mind does, a mind must be something else).

The point is that we dont assign consciousness purely based on effects. Blockhead acts like its conscious and a completely paralyzed person acts like theyre not, yet we all know that the first isnt conscious and the second is.
 
Actually, we do assign consciousness purely based on effects. The only things we perceive of the world are through our senses, which are effects in the physical world. Theres no other way for us to assign consciousness.
 
Yet we all know - what kind of argument is that? No, we dont all know - thats incredibly lazy thinking. You have to back up your assertions with some logic.
 
Searle points out that this is impossible; information processes cant cause consciousness because theyre not brute facts.
 
What does this mean? A lot of philosophers dont understand computers, but computers are brute facts - you can touch them - and also information processes, because they use the physical laws of the universe to perform computations.
 
Because one property of computer programs is that they can run on any sort of hardware. The same program can run on your Mac or a PC or a series of gears and pulleys. Which means it must be the program thats important; the hardware cant be relevant. Which is patently absurd.
 
Why is it patently absurd? You need to get away from these lazy assertions, and actually provide some reasons, and, you know, a logical argument. As you know, all machines which are Turing-equivalent can model any computation (see your computer science education for the proof), and the physical laws of the universe can be used to model a Turing-equivalent machine (see any desktop computer as an evidence-based fact), therefore in a very real way, the hardware is not relevant. It couldnt really be more clear to me!
 
FWIW, I view the universe as a computation, and a long time ago - about the age of 13 or so - I came around to the conclusion that any computation in the universe is indistinguishable from free will / consciousness. If you replaced every one of the neurons in your head with a miniature device that acted like a neuron, then thered be no effective difference in your behaviour, yet now your brain would be formed out of components we could model in a computer - down to the low-level physical laws, if necessary. It seems to me, that following this line of reasoning, all that is required to simulate a conscious being inside a computer (and  by analogy the Chinese Room), is a thorough understanding of (1) physics and (2) the physical structure of neurons and their interconnections.
 
Would the result be conscious? Well, guess what - I dont know that youre conscious. Nobody knows anything about anybody elses consciousness. We just have to believe what they say when they say theyre conscious, so instead, it comes down to intelligence. And the only criteria we have for deciding intelligence - in spite of your objections, which you havent backed up - are the senses we receive, i.e. the input into the brain, which is formed completely from the output of the simulation. I view the Turing test as a thought experiment that demonstrates that we evaluate intelligence only through outward behaviour - its the only way we can evaluate anything - and therefore intelligence can be simulated.

Just one further point, after remembering a few things. Many philosophers theorizing about consciousness still still use homunculus-based approaches, e.g. see:
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus#The_homunculus_argument_or_fallacy_in_the_philosophy_of_mind
 
Many philosophers have tried to use infinite regression of homunculi as an argument that theres something special, or magical, about the human mind, without realizing that the physical laws of the universe can themselves form a very simple homunculus, terminating the infinite regression - thus many disproofs of theories based on infinite regression are actually incorrect.
 
The Chinese Room argument is similar: we see inside the box (were given special knowledge of how the box, aka the brain, works) to see the literal homunculus, and therefore its obvious, or patently clear that it (the whole system) is not conscious.
 
Problem is, would we make the same claim if we knew exactly what was inside the human skull-box? If not, why not? Is it any different?
 
To me, the human skull-box and the Chinese Room are perfectly analogous. The homunculus is literal in the Chinese Room, but its the physical laws of the universe in a brain or a computer. The instructions and book in the Chinese Room are the physical state and structure of the brains neurons. It seems to me that if you support the thesis that the Chinese Room is not conscious, then you believe that the human mind is not conscious.

Jerry Fodor. The scope of his work is not as extensive as Searles, but its definitely important (he provides the best arguments for the so-called cognitivist approach) and has contributed very original ideas about the structure of the mind. It is a pleasure to read him - you could read any of his works without any previous knowledge of the matter and still benefit from them.

Huh? Were assuming the theoretical possibility that building a computer program to solve the Turing Test is possible. Then were writing the program down in human language as instructions in a book. The book is not a conscious mind. This may turn out not to actually be possible in reality, but thats why its a thought experiment. This is also not an artifact of language.
 
talboito:  Yes, Searle does come off as a bit arrogant even in writing. But Ive learned to tolerate some level of arrogance.
 
Barry caught a typo which Ive now fixed (I had effects instead of behavior. His other arguments dont seem particularly convincing to me  he falls for exactly the trap I state: he confuses epistemology with ontology.
 
I should clarify that this piece is not meant to be a rigorous philsophical argument, just a reflection on recent events. The reason Ive been talking to people about this stuff is that Ive been working on the more rigorous piece.
 
Barry: The difference between the Chinese room and the brain is that brains cause consciousness.

I think you are unfair to poor old Mr. Dennett. His usual argument against this kind of thing holds up well to the Blockhead case, for example:
 
When you say Obviously such a list would be unreasonably long in practice, perhaps even when heavily compressed, but let us play along theoretically. you are asking us to play along with something unrealistic - and thats the problem. How long is unreasonably long - well, think how big a list of all 30-minute conversations are. If each word could be followed by one of 10 others, and speech happens at 1 word per second, then thats 10^(180) conversations. So it is reasonable to say No - I will not play along, even theoretically.

I dont go in much because I think you are only playing with American tradition context. But the word consciousness - and epistemology or ontology - these arent used very well in this piece.
 
Lets say Babbage probably didnt think of Turing test (He didnt. Wicked enough!). But maybe kids in the bedroom given teddy bears to play with (19th century?) gave souls and everything they could give - to their teddy bears.
 
Then Turings test came. (and yeah Strong AI school, bit later, with some very particular kid of information theory thing) And then ripples in the pond.
 
But then you got Johns Hopkinss Ben Carsons one argument - or suggestion about the topic of the argument, why we let other humans to waste what their brains potentially got.
 
Say we all got good enough hardwares, but we dont want to install softwares, and we tolerate hardwares being wasted with bad, poorly written softwares. (Go Tenderloin or Hunters point or Richmond in east bay or East Oakland, say. You see potential Mac Tower Pro or supercomputers playing  - or stuck with - 30 years old Atari games - or even something less than that.)
 
He did that argument in some places - in talk to public, and seems it didnt fly.
 
So we are going back to teddy bears again. Such a cool argument. I cant wait to see your real piece.

Its an old book so there may now be better but, The Minds I goes through all of this (as does Permutation City, mind-blowingly, by Greg Egan). I dont claim that the following is Hofstadters answer though.
 
I think its possible that a human could animate a stop-motion consciousness, with symbols etc. And that, I wouldnt have a problem with accepting as conscious.
 
What youve put as Searles big comeback about causality I dont understand. I certainly dont think that processing information makes machines conscious. I dont know what you or Searle are arguing, so maybe Im on your side and dont realize it but, I distrust any argument that takes concepts that are pre-experience or understanding of what consciousness is, and tries to run with them. Minsky sums it up for me:
 
It is too easy to say things like, Computers cant do (xxx), because they have no feelings, or thoughts. But heres a way to turn such sayings into foolishness. Change them to read like this. Computer cant do (xxx), because all they can do is execute incredibly intricate processes, perhaps millions at a time. Now, such objections seem less convincing  yet all we did was face one simple, complicated fact: we really dont yet know what the limits of computers are. Now lets face the other simple fact: OUR NOTIONS OF THE human MIND ARE JUST AS PRIMITIVE. (my emphasis)

I havent read the above comments. I suppose I should. What if Blockhead had no record of conversations, only a set of rules hardwired in, and a large but lossy memory, and a clock that wasnt quite perfect. He, lets call Blockhead he, I think theres a Peanuts character named Blockhead, or at least on of them calls another Blockhead. Anyway
 
Blockhead, over time, receives audio input and one of his hard-wired rules is to drive a speaker at varying frequencies. Another rule is to keep track of how many times a particular driven pattern through the speaker is followed by another pattern. And record all of this, again, in a lossy sort of way. Loosing some random fraction of whats been collected, at a rate that falls off with time. That is, theres always a lot coming in, so Blockhead is always shedding a lot of recent data, but there is a pile of old stuff that slowly builds up. And even some of that is lost, but the rate functions are balanced so theres a slow accumulation. Another rule is to pattern-match. Pattern-match all sorts of things, and assign those patterns over time, the ones that happen so frequently they arent lost, assign random names to those patterns, and put those random names at specific addresses. And even those addresses will be lost if they arent reinforced. But another rule Blockhead follows is to repeat driving patterns on the speaker if a pattern of response is detected. Add in a rule to favor own survival over survival of another.
 
Over, and over, and over. All the time. Hell develop grammar, syntax, style. A sense of time. A sense of rules for conversation. Confabulating many possible responses, he will have access to rules, tried over time, that allow him to choose some confabulations that are better than others, and drive the speaker with those.
 
Maybe throw in some additional shortcuts. Add a video feed. Favor visual patterns with a lot of green on the bottom, and blue on top. Favor visual patterns that look like this :) only rotated 90 clockwise. Add in the ability to distinguish chemical smells and  similar lossy association patterns can be ruled between smells and :) patterns and green/blue patterns, and certain audio patterns.
 
Make Blockhead reproducible, with a lossy pattern of the program. Make a pattern such that Blockheads cant tolerate another Blockhead whos responses vary too far from the patterns that he recognized in the the first few years of life. Make Blockhead want to destroy Blockheads that dont match the pattern. Youll have Blockheads that more and more efficiently learn to recognize patterns, and youll have clusters of Blockheads. Predictably, Blockheads near the borders of their clusters will at once destroy each other more often, and end up with new patterns and an urge to integrate the groups. Ill bet they even naturally select code patterns that the original designer never predicted, more closely aligned to survival in their environment.
 
Dont give me the usual crap about random numbers not being truly random. Schrodingers equations assure us that those tiny little atoms that cause solids (please, causation hasnt a thing to do with it. Have you considered that it just is? Maybe the math just fell out that way in this particular instance of a universe?) will eventually induce measurable randomness into the clock. Even NISTs clocks arent perfect. Not perfect.
 
How much. odds. These things are fundamental.
 
Random chance and self-repeating patterns condensing out of a huge chaos over vast amounts of time. Causation at the quantum level and causation at the level of human affairs are two things that follow different rules. Not because theres a definitional difference in causation, but because there are so many how many, how much questions of probability in between.
 
Of course the biological Blockhead is self-aware by every possible test and entirely able to transcribe meaningless symbols. Pattern-matching and lossy memory and a fuzzy clock over time lead to this mental model.
 
The academies of philosophers and economists suffer from the same failure of mind: we can confabulate any situation there ever could be, but it only gets interesting when we start trying to find out how much. Pursuing theory without observation is tantamount to murder. So is observation without doubt.

Saying that thermostats have some level of consciousness (as Chalmers seems to do) just strikes me as crazy and thats not a trick of language.
 
Its like saying an ice cube has some level of heat. So you react Thats crazy! An ice cube is cold, not hot!. Would it sound crazy to say (a similar but not identical idea) thermostats have some level of reaction to their environment? Its obviously talking about a trivially small amount of a quantity we think of, linguistically, in terms of a high level of the quantity. It would help to distinguish between temperature (the quantity) and hot (high level the quantity). The trick of language is that consciousness is used in both senses (like the word heat).
 
Huh? Were assuming the theoretical possibility that building a computer program to solve the Turing Test is possible.
 
Thats right. ASSUMING! The point is that assumption itself is arguably circular or tautological. The artifact of language is that it allows you to hide that circularity or tautology from inspection. Its like Maxwells Demon: assume we could distinguish between hot and cold (high and low energy) particles, then  We are assuming that  In theory  The problem here is that it turns out that to do the operation of distinguish is dubious, in terms of possibly taking more energy itself. Similarly, the glib phrase of writing the program down in human language as instructions in a book may not be possible in way that doesnt turn out to be, in practice, create an artificial intelligence.

This piece was way below par for you Aaron. Most of the things that you said were obviously the case are not at all obvious. It is like a Christian saying well obviously God exists - obvious to a Christian yes, but not to an Athiest. You just made a load of unsubstantiated statements of faith.
 
For what its worth, all of Dennets points seem quite reasonable to me, but I wouldnt go so far as to say that they are obviously true, because they clearly arent from your perspective. I admit I havent read widely on the subject (Penrose and Hofstadter are my other two main jumping off points) but I have had quite a few more years than you to mull it over.
 
It seems to me that you are simply defining consciousness as something that occurs in brains. If we accept your definition the clearly it cant occur in computers. That is no better or worse than defining conciousness as whatever property is shared between all potential systems that could pass a Turing test, it is just a different definition. Whatever definition of consciousness we might come up with, clearly it should apply to human beings (both the above definitions do). Beyond that, who can say whether an ant is concious whereas a hypothetical computer program that passes the Turing test is not? Or the other way round? It entirely depends what you mean by the word.
 
In fact, some people say that human beings are not conscious in general and that consciousness is only achieved in certain enlightened beings after years of meditation etc. Or that there is only a single Universal consciousness etc.
 
Answers are meaningless unless you know what the question is and I dont think we do. It is like asking for the answer to Life,
the Universe and Everything.
 
I expect better from you and look forward to a future post on the subject in which you actually have something substantive to say.

Well this is a fascinating topic that Ive been thinking a lot about lately. I have not studied it much yet, so I may be ignorant of one thing or another. But I have to say that Aarons argument is almost completely unsatisfying. Im not even sure what his point is. This is a little bit of a ramble; my apologies.
 
We (conscious humans) look at something and decide to interpret it as an information process; but such processes dont exist in the world and thus cant have causal powers.
 
I honestly dont even know what that means. Its hardly the knock-down argument I was waiting for. Reminds me of the kind of thing Thomas Aquinas might say  my apologies for such a shoddy kind of reply; its just I dont understand the statement well enough to make a rational reply to it.
 
We know that consciousness, whatever it is, exists, because we experience it. But we dont yet know what causes it. Were ruling out appeals to phenomenon that doesnt come down to physics.
 
Saying that humans do not consciously understand English is false more or less by definition  what else can we mean by consciousness?
 
There are only two ways out of it: you can either claim that no one is conscious or that everything is conscious
 
How does this follow? I cant say that certain kinds of arrangements of atoms, whose defining characteristics are as yet unknown, are conscious, and others arent?
 
Obviously consciousness is created by the brain (at least, thats what the behavior of other apparently conscious systems would indicate, when their brains are destroyed).  The only conceivable explanation, to me, is that consciousness is created by some process of computation, because there is nothing else there, that I know of, in our brains.
 
I have to agree with the guy who quoted Minsky. Something in the way our brains atoms are configured creates our experience, which we can only guess is something different from the experience of an insect or an ordinary computer program. If a chess playing program has state that registers that it is losing, is that the same as experiencing pain for a simple animal? For a human? If not, what is the difference? State that registers the state?
 
Basically I dont see the relation between these questions, which seem the pertinent ones to me, and what Aaron is talking about.
 
Thus, no computer can ever consciously understand Chinese, because no computer does more than what youre doing  its simply following a set of instructions.
 
The hardware is just following instructions. How do we know that computer hardware, plus a large pile of state, plus some transition rules, is not conscious? Isnt that pretty much what our brains are, as far as we know?
 
consciousness is a natural phenomenon which  is caused by the actions of the brain in the same way solidity is caused by the actions of atoms
 
How is this different from being caused by computation?
 
Heres awaiting your real post  in the mean time, unsubstantiated rambles are what you get back, from me at least :)

Searles Chinese Room experiment is a trivial misdirection. He focuses on the man in the room matching symbols rather than the creator of the semantic and syntactic translation rules. That designer was conscious. The man in the room is working unconsciously. When I speak my mouth and vocal cords do the translation from nerve impulses to sound patterns but it is entirely unconscious. You have to follow the trail back into the brain where you get lost because consciousness is an emergent property of the neural networks, not a property of the machinery at all.

Whats fascinating about the Chinese Room is that its a great litmus test.  People on both sides of the issue are absolutely clear on their position and think the people on the other side are being deliberately obtuse.
 
My own take on it: I admit Im deeply confused by why the information processes in my head would lead to my real subjective experience, but since I doubt that neurons have any essential properties that transistors lack, I have to conclude that software, in neuron or transistor form, can somehow lead to consciousness.  If theres some other process beyond that, adding qualia on top of the information processing, then I think that would have to be a property of the universe itself, not neurons as such.
 
What Ive always wanted to ask Searle is this: what exactly is it that you think neurons are doing, physically, that transistors cant do?  If I invented transistors that added that capability, could I build a consciousness out of them?

Then thats using the large amount sense of the word. In that sense of the word - again, IN THAT SENSE OF THE WORD - I dont think anyone would be claiming thermostats have consciousness. They might say that using a different sense of the word, one akin (though not identical) to reaction to the environment.

Cmon - youve debugged programs. You KNOW how complicated this is in practice.
What does follow it mean? It just may mean Create a process of such complexity that its a consciousnesses.
 
And this is where we start getting circular. All 1-3 basically say, is that if consciousness is an information process, then following an information process acts like consciousness. Thats circular. What 1-3 tries to do is say information processes are trivial things, by using trivializing language by assumption - i.e. write it down in a book IMPLIES, emotionally, trivial. Thats where the linguistic artifacts come in.
 
He doesnt. The program does. Another way of phrasing 1-4 is Assume we could build an artificial intelligence which passed the Turing Test in Chinese. Then a man could run that AI program and ask it something in Chinese, and it would answer in Chinese.. Which is rather tautological.
 
Only because you hid an assumption of that in the first place, by implicitly describing the AI above as not consciousness.

Or in a more straightforward manner than Seth.
 
The Chinese Room assumes that the process of translating a language is an enumerable process, and hence describable in software on a Von-Neuman machine. Of course it isnt, so it cant be.
 
The reality of both human language comprehension and translation of such is far more complicated, and consciousness, which is a requirement for doing either or both activities in a recognizably human fashion, will therefore not be expressible in a Von-Neuman machine architecture.
 
Consciousness is not a counting problem, and can not be reduced to a counting problem. It is some other beast.
 
You can take an aspect of the thinking process and reduce it to a counting problem, but you can not combine some number, or even an infinite number, of counting problems to create human recognizable thinking.

You can use a counting, Von Neumann machine to represent floating point numbers to any precision you like, and use those to simulate a brain complete with juices in the grey matter and the firing of neurons (go down to the molecules if you like). Of course no actual man in a room could give you an answer in his lifetime but its just a thought experiment. If this system represents a Chinese speakers brain and its a faithful reproduction I see no reason why it wouldnt count as a consciousness. Dont be mislead by the fact that its life would run very slowly; it wont notice.

As far as I can tell, Aaron is saying that consciousness is a physical thing that happens in brains. Our experience of consciousness is a physical characteristic of what working brains do. Something like that. In which case, a computer program might be able to perfectly model it, but it would not actually be the thing itself. A computer could perfectly model a rock, and tell you everything about the rocks behavior, but that internal modelling would not be a rock.
 
Of course, it is possible that consciousness is a physical thing.
 
IMHO, However, whether it is true is not shown by the example of the Chinese room. It is also possible that the invisible dragon in my garage is a physical thing. Since we dont as have any way of detecting the difference between this type of consciousness and a simulated consciousness, its a lot like saying that consciousness is an invisible, undetectable, dragon in your head.
 
So, hopefully, Aaron can supply us with some reason that consciousness is a physical thing. Sorry if Im acting obtuse.
 
Also, the bulk of Searles description of consciousness as a natural phenomenon natural phenomenon which developed through evolutionary processes and is caused by the actions of the brain does not conflict at all with the functionalists Information Process idea of consciousness. The only part that conflicts is the idea that it is a physical thing.
 
Prove that, and you wont have to deal with this argument anymore.

Aaron,
 
the neuroscience researchers, neurologists and psychiatrists define consciousness as level of response to the environment. Subjective self-awareness is a definition that enables circular arguments about consciousness. Its navel-gazing. If you want some mind-breaking logic, go do quantum physics or take a higher math class taught in the method of R. L. Moore. Im sure somebody at Stanford or MIT is teaching one.

The blockhead argument seems very misleading to me.  Some reasons:
 
You cant build it in our universe, or in any universe remotely like ours.  (Even if the universe was big enough to contain the information required for blockhead, it wouldnt be able to access it quickly enough to carry on the conversation without transmitting information faster than the speed of light.)  This isnt a pedantic quibble - thought experiments are only useful when their premise cant be ruled out entirely.  Youre claiming that the turing test is bad because we can build this obviously unconscious system that could pass it - but we cant build it - not even close.
 
Even if it could exist, you immediately run into a problem with your definition of all possible conversations.  Which conversations are possible and which arent?  Are you restricting it to conversations that would not be implausible to have with a mentally sound person?  Or does it include all conversations that are grammatic, even if they are completely non-linear?  If you choose the latter, it probably wouldnt even seem conscious, if you choose the former, it is hard to see how you could build something like blockhead without creating an AI to build blockhead.  And that means that blockhead is just an expansion of all the possible ways that the state of that AI could evolve over the course of 30 minutes.  And here is where the slight-of-hand comes in: You know that people wont intuitively agree that the AI cant be conscious, since it is after all an AI.  So you try to trick them into calling an extremely inefficient representation of that AI unconscious, because its easy to say a big list isnt conscious as long as you dont stop and think about how big big is here.
 
Ignoring the above point, a list of all possible conversations is not sufficient.  Conversations involve choices made by both parties - for example if I ask blockhead what its favorite color is, it can say red or blue.  What part of blockhead makes that choice?

I personally recommend Richard Rorty, who might show you that many of the words your have tried to throw around (e.g. ontology) are philosophical debris.
 
The whole consciousness debate is ridiculous.  No reasonable definition is being presented.  You seem to take pleasure in using it in awkward contexts to show how great your (ill-defined) argument is.  This technique of argument is frequently know as question begging.
 
As far as thinking about this problem in general though, I would recommend you abandon being a partisan in a tired debate and look at some current research in neuroscience.  fMRI has given us insight into the brain that simply wasnt possible when Dennett and Searle got started on this debate.  Heres one public exchange these two had twelve years ago:
 
http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1680
 
I really recommend try some of Peter Dayans papers on for size.  Not the easiest stuff to get started on, but you get discussion of the brain based on solid research, not Chinese false dichotomy.

Im not Dennetts biggest fan, but hes a clever guy who can be a pleasure to read.  You end your post looking like a glib Searle fanboy by charging that he is insane.  The Dennett you are refering to is what many in philosophy would call a straw man set up by Searle.

Blockhead is interesting. Assume that the inquisitor gets the first move and makes a statement. Assume I am the inquisitor and my first statement is X. Presumably Blockhead does a lookup in its table of initial statements and gives the corresponding response Y (ignore the fact that even this hypothetical table of initial statements may have more entries than the number of protons in the universe). After the end of the conversation another inquisitor comes along and starts a conversation with statement X. Blockhead of course does not know whether this inquisitor is me again or someone else. Say it is me and I again start with statement X - blockhead will respond again with Y, whereas a conscious being might well come up with a different response, eg Hey, thats weird, someone just asked me that.
 
If blockhead is only judged on one single conversation it can be deterministic and will always respond in exactly the same way. A concious being would not do that. This perhaps indicates a weakness of the Turing test.
 
Imagine that Blockhead is going to be judged on multiple conversations, then I would say it could not pass itself off as conscious unless it keeps state from previous conversations. Imagine X is How many conversations have you had? If Y is
Ten then I could respond by saying But you said that last time I spoke to you, so it must be at least 11. So Blockhead would have to respond with something like What, you believe everything I say? or My memory is terrible. So Blockheads lookup tables must be designed to be consistent with a being that keeps no state information between conversations. I would hesitate to refer to any such hypothetical being as conscious.

The trouble with the Chinese Room is that is postulates that the room is possible to construct and then draws conclusions from that assumption. Its as if I were to say Suppose I presented you with a pig that could speak Hungarian, would you say that the pig was conscious or not? My first reaction would be to say show me the pig. Somehow, people who would consider the idea of a Hungarian-speaking pig to be ludicrous are happy to accept the idea of a Chinese-speaking room.
 
Lets go with that assumption for a moment, though. Where did the data from the room come from? Well, of course it came from someone who could speak Chinese. Somehow we compiled details of all the knowledge of Chinese of that person into an instruction list for the room, in an analogy with a computer program.
 
Lets follow that analogy a bit. Instead of a compiled model, consider instead an interpreted model. In computer language terms these things are equivalent. Usually the only difference comes down to performance. Instead of pre-compiling the knowledge of the Chinese speaker, just put the speaker into the room and let him interpret the incoming messages and produce the output. Is there any doubt now where the consciousness of the room lies?

Lets look at Blockhead, now. The definition says It simply contains a list of all possible thirty minute conversations.
 
What proceess could be used to compile such a list. I would assert that there are only two ways that such a list could be generated. The first is to have a person or a number of persons sit around and think up all the different conversations and record them. The second would be to have a computer generate all 30-minute combinations of words and then have one or more people filter out the ones which are meaningless.
 
Even if we assume that the set of conversations could practically be generated (i.e. not take longer than, say, the heat-death of the universe to compile), it is perfectly clear that the only way to generate the list for Blockhead to work on is to pass it through the mind of one or more conscious entities.
 
Neither this post or my earlier one on the Chinese room actually say anything about what consciousness is or might be. They simply point out that the postulates of both the Chinese Room and Blockhead are invalid, so any questions or conclusions that might arise from those problems are invalid.

We dont consider the cellphone to be concious because we know that what appears to be one person talking to a box is actually there are two people having a conversation in real time through a box.
 
The instructions in the Chinese room are an asynchronous form of communication.  The outsider is having a conversation, asynchronously, with whoever wrote those instructions.  The person who wrote the instructions presubably understands Chinese.
 
The same is true of computer programs.  The user is having a delayed, anticipated conversation with the programmer.
 
You can play all sorts of tricks to make devices seem alive (Tickle-Me-Elmo), but if you consider these tricks to simply be asynchronous communication all the deep philosophical moments go away.

Title: Reagan, Star Wars, and the End of the Cold War
 

 
Its not hard to see why building technology to defend against nuclear missiles is tricky. First, theres the obvious difficulty of shooting at a moving target  like a bullet shooting a bullet. Then theres the fact that whatever device is defending you must itself be well defended, or else the enemy can simply take it out. And then theres the nasty fact that with nuclear war, near-perfect defense is necessary  even a single failure can cause enormous damage.
 
What is hard is explaining why, despite this, so many people took the idea so seriously. Thats the question Frances FitzGerald takes up in Way Out There In The Blue, in which she uses the Star Wars initiative as a prism with which to understand the Reagan administration. Combined with Rick Perlsteins forthcoming Nixonland, the books provide allegorical insight into our current government: Bush II has combined the criminality of Nixon with the intellectual emptiness of Reagan.
 
Ronald Reagan was an actor. Even when off the set, he recited polished lines and played up a well-practiced demeanor. Indeed, he appears to have no inner life whatsoever. No one can be found to whom Ronald Reagan ever opened up; even his wife commented that Theres a wall around him  even I feel that barrier. As president, he was given the equivalent of shooting instructions specifying exactly where he was supposed to be every hour of the day and when he attended public events toe marks were chalked on the ground to indicate where he should stand.
 
Considering the state of the American political system, having an actor for a President is perhaps not the worst idea. But what was problematic was that nobody  including Reagans closest aides  seemed to realize that that was what they were getting. For months they were continually shocked that Reagan refused to ever make a decision or take an action on any issue whatsoever. Instead, they watched dumbly as he simply listened to what he was told and nodded politely. When two of his subordinates disagreed, he was uncomfortable, but he steadfastly refused to intervene.
 
The result was that decisions ended up getting made by whoever was around  Nancy Reagan, his wife; Michael Deaver, his aide in charge of public relations; etc. Reagans top people, such as his cabinet officials, frightened that they were actually making policy without any supervision, kept this fact secret from their staffs and the public until they all published their kiss-and-tell memoirs after Reagan had left office. Even more shocking, Reagan didnt seem to mind when the members of this group changed. One day Reagans inner circle informed him that they were leaving and bringing the Treasury Secretary in to take their place. Reagan simply thanked them for their service.
 
There was one thing Reagan did seem to care about (aside from politely answering his fan mail): speeches. Reagan would rewrite his own speeches, removing abstract verbiage and adding homespun stories. And it was out of this concern that he stumbled into launching the Star Wars initiative.
 
After many years of right-wing propaganda about a window of vulnerability in our arms race with the Soviet Union, the Pentagon developed the MX missile series to ensure American superiority. The problem was where to put them. The MX missiles were designed to protect against the Soviets simply destroying all of our missiles, so they could not simply be put out in the open or the Soviets would simply destroy them as well. A variety of Rube Goldberg-like ideas were proposed to solve the problem.
 
After a thorough investigation, the military concluded the best solution was what came to be called the racetrack: the missiles would be put on huge underground circular tracks, with little launching stations cut sporadically in the track. There would be several times more launching stations than missiles, so the Soviets would not know which stations to attack. But, to verify compliance with arms treaties, the stations could be opened so that the Soviets could see which ones contained missiles from space.
 
The problem was that the racetracks would need to be huge and the only practical space for such a thing was in Utah. The Mormon Church was understandably unhappy about having a huge nuclear missile field being built near them and thus the powerful Republicans from that region of the country scuttled the plan.
 
Other ideas were tried  the racetrack was converted to a straight line system, then to a configuration known as Dense Pack in which the missiles were all placed close together, in the hopes that all the missiles coming to attack them would blow each other up and perhaps spare some of our missiles. Another plan, known as Big Bird, had the missiles flying overhead on large transport planes, but it was scrapped when technicians raised concerns about the wings falling off. Another proposal involved hiding the missiles as normal luggage on cross-country passenger trains. It got to the point where the best idea was literally known as DUMB  deep underground missile basing  in which the missiles would be loaded on corkscrews which would drill down underground. Finally, they decided just to deploy the missiles in superficially-hardened housing, even though this meant they could be easily destroyed.
 
At the same time, a mass popular movement for a nuclear freeze was growing, encompassing college students, churches, and many unpoliticized citizens. Reagans credibility on foreign policy was slipping away while books and movies and massive protests scared citizens into thinking about the unthinkable prospect of a nuclear holocaust. The Democrats were seizing power and mindshare and a nuclear freeze bill passed the House. Clearly something had to be done.
 
Missile defense seemed like the perfect alternative. It didnt require any diplomatic changes or sacrificing any weapons development  indeed, it allowed for more spending on research. But it allowed Reagan to use the language of the doves  a sincere desire to rid the world of the scourge of nuclear war. So when a Reagan aide proposed the idea (which the aide conceived of as a chip to be bargained away for with the Soviets), Reagan seized upon the idea and worked it into a speech at the next available opportunity.
 
There was just one problem: nobody had any idea how to make it work. The most prominent right-wing scientist, Edward Teller, was very excited about a new technology in which a high-powered X-ray could be sent along a rod to vaporize small objects. Teller proposed a large satellite with such rods sticking out of it, a device that came to be known as the space-based sea urchin. What happens when the Soviets target the defense? he was asked. Teller didnt seem to have considered the question but, unfazed, came back the next day suggesting the defense weapons be stored underwater and pop up when missiles were overhead.
 
Such debates disguised the fact that no actual missile defense technology existed or was likely to for a long, long time. Tactics and costs for disintegration rays and sea urchins could be discussed endlessly, but such discussion was irrelevant, as nobody knew how to build the key components. But this fact was carefully kept from politicians and the press who, ignorant of the science, continued to discuss missile defense as if it was a serious proposal. Thus, a majority of Americans were convinced that scientific ingenuity would find a way to protect the country  indeed, they believed it already had.
 
But the sheen of a someday-to-be-developed missile defense system could not last forever  Reagan needed something more repeatable to boost his flagging poll numbers, especially in the wake of such scandals as Iran-contra. The result was an ongoing series of carefully-spun summits with the Soviets, in which the President claimed to be making good progress on negotiations for arms reduction. (That negotiated arms reduction could serve as a replacement for a missile defense initiative never seemed to occur to the Reagan administration; it was not exactly a group prone to analytical self-reflection.)
 
On the Russian side, Mikhail Gorbachev, a brilliant and daring new politician, had come to power. Gorbachev seemed more like an American figure than a Russian one  he spoke plainly, made daring moves toward peace, and played well for the cameras. For much of the following years, Gorbachev had higher poll numbers in the US than Reagan did. Washington was said to have been swept away with Gorby fever and Gorbymania.
 
Gorbachev unilaterally made a series of striking reforms in both domestic and foreign policy. He offered the US a wide variety of concessions in disarmament talks, insisting only that the US stop the SDI program (the one principle which Reagan refused to concede). Then he begun the process of glasnost, increasing the freedom of the press and allowing a left-wing reform movement to develop. As part of this, he freed dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov, who proceeded to tell the media that SDI was a bluff that the US could never successfully develop. Shortly thereafter, Gorbachev was even willing to budge on that, allowing the US to continue SDI. Meanwhile, he begun the process of perestroika, reforming the Russian political and economic system to increase the scope of democracy.
 
Meanwhile, Reagans side continued to bungle or misunderstand all of Gorbachevs moves, using his disarmament proposals for little more than PR victories at home and continuing to insist his reforms were merely cosmetic attempts to prop up the old system. Reagan and Gorbachev continued to hold summits with plentiful photo opportunities, but little in the way of actual agreement was ever reached.
 
Indeed, Reagan actually made Gorbachevs reforms much more difficult by doing things like giving speeches demanding the General Secretary tear down this wall. Such speeches only lent credence to the conservatives who charged that Gorbachev was simply doing the Wests dirty work from the inside.
 
Yet despite Reagans ineptitude, Gorbachevs reforms took hold  perhaps even more strongly than he had intended  and the old Soviet system began to fall apart. Democratic parties were elected, troops were withdrawn, and the wall finally came down.
 
But Americans were reluctant to believe that the destruction of the Soviet system had come from the reformers within it. Instead, they retrospectively lionized Reagan as the man whose tough talk had made the system come apart.

To be fair (and to the best of my knowledge), there has not been a successful test of a missile defense system taking down a missile with multiple warheads and realistic countermeasures.
 
Not surprising.  It is a difficult problem.  And the penalty for letting even one active warhead through is pretty effing staggering.
 
I would put it on the same order of magnitude of difficulty as mass consumer flying cars.  There is nothing theoretically impossible about mass consumer flying cars, but I dont expect a dealership to open near my house in four score years.

I have no idea what to think of Gorbachev.
 
As I see it, the main difference between Soviet Communism and the Communism practiced by China and Vietnam is that the Soviets believed in a global revolution and believed they could jump from a third world state to first world in one generation.
 
China and Vietnam seem to have no pretensions of a global revolution, and seem to see communism as the quickest way to move from third world to first world, but being realistic about its speed.
 
Practicality triumphs.
 
I dont see that Gorbachev had much choice.  Controlling the Soviet satellite states consumed resources Russia could not afford, easing back control was tried, but ethnic loyalties exploded free the very first moment restraining force was slightly eased.

[I remember his orbituary in SF Chron (2003, Sept 10th) - I can recall how I read it, while I was also reading about Szilard and other Hungarian Jews. It was a puzzling read and its stuck in the corner of my memory.]
 
I dont know how to put link (url string is too long), so just some lines.  The whole article is available from SF Chronicles archive.]
 
His staunch support for a strong national defense was forged as a boy during the 1919 Communist revolution in his native Hungary and was strengthened as a young man studying in Germany as Hitler and the Nazi Party rose to power. Even the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union were not enough to shake his unwavering support for a powerful defense.
 
The danger for ballistic missiles in the hands of 18 different nations has increased, and will increase, unless we have a defense, he once said. If we want to have stable, peaceful conditions, defense against sudden attack by rockets is more needed than ever.
 
Teller was born Jan. 15, 1908, in Budapest. He was raised in a comfortable middle-class home surrounded by music, art, poetry and literature, but he and his family also felt the sting of anti-Semitism.
 
He witnessed the rise of Hitler and Nazism in Germany during the 1920s and 1930s, and he fled to London four years after earning his doctorate in physics under Werner Heisenberg at the University of Leipzig in 1930.
 
He spent just one year lecturing at the University of London before he and his wife, Mici, immigrated to the United States in 1935 so he could teach at George Washington University. They became American citizens in 1941.
 
During many years as a professor at UC Berkeley, however, Teller  regardless of his political beliefs  earned widespread praise among undergraduates for his skill, his charm and his clarity in teaching Physics 10, the elementary physics course designed for liberal arts students with no strong interest in science.
 
In his personal life, Teller possessed a typical Hungarian charm  he met visitors with grace, played the piano with great skill for reporters who interviewed him and maintained a wide circle of friends  as well as opponents  both at Berkeley and at Stanford.

Its slightly misleading to state that the world discovered that missile defense wouldnt work until Sakharov started talking about it. Groups such as the American Physical Society published a number large of reports on the feasibility of star wars that were politically quite influential. The APS reports stated that star wars were unlikely to work.

I didnt say that, nor does FitzGerald. What I said was that Sakharov told the media that SDI was a bluff. FitzGerald argues that there was something about Sakharovs stature that allowed the government to realize that this was really true when he said it, even though others had said it many times before.

Your analysis of Gorbachevs role in the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc is not correct.   The reforms (and the choice of Gorbachev as General Secretary) were an attempt to prevent the complete economic and ideological collapse of the Soviet sytem.   When public reaction to the reforms spiraled out of control, Gorbachev made the commendable decision not to use force (except for the tragic example of Lithuania) to reassert Soviet authority.     The destruction of the Soviet system came from its complete bankruptcy (in all senses of the word); Gorbachevs contribution was allowing it to happen with a minimum of violence.

Title: Why You Shop At Wal-Mart: Economics Eats Itself
 

 
There is a theory (quite an elegant one, actually) that says that because we live in a marketplace of free choices we end up getting basically what we want  our dollars are like votes for the society we wish to live in. Many have challenged this view, from a variety of perspectives, but Tom Slee (who calls this notion MarketThink) has chosen to focus on just one: the economic subfield of game theory.
 
In his elegant little book, the poorly-titled No One Makes You Shop At Wal-Mart, Slee walks through the major discoveries of game theory, explains them in simple language with reference to a fictional town of Whimsley, and discusses how they refute standard economic conclusions while still playing by basic economic assumptions with effects that appear to show up in the real world.
 
Take the problem of littering, for example. The town of Whimsley has a large park between its coffee shop and its office building. Residents can toss their empty coffee cups on the ground in the park, thereby saving themselves the trouble of carrying it but minutely spoiling the park, or they can carry it to the trash at the office, saving the park but bothering their hands. In the absence of anyone else, each resident is better off tossing their cup  the bother of carrying it is much more than the small amount of spoilage. But if everyone does this, the park is quickly full of litter. Each individual, acting perfectly rationally, creates a situation that none of them want.
 
A similar problem gives the book its title. Imagine you get some utility from having a vibrant downtown of independent shops. Then a Wal-Mart opens up on the outskirts of town. You begin shopping at the Wal-Mart because the prices are cheaper and you can still walk through the vibrant downtown when you like. But with everyone buying things at Wal-Mart, the downtown stores can no longer afford to stay open and the center of your city turns into an empty husk. Youd prefer to have the vibrant downtown to the Wal-Mart, but nobody ever gave you that choice.
 
The book is full of dozens of examples like this, each with careful analysis and clear writing. Perhaps the most odd feature of the book is its politics. On the one hand, Slee is plainly a committed leftist, with positive references to Naomi Klein and other capitalist critics. But on the other hand, he never gives up on the rational actor and methodological individualist assumptions of modern economics, and shows little patience for those (typically his political allies) who have more thorough-going critiques. Nonetheless, the book is a recommended read for anyone interested in these questions.
 
Online Bonus: Watch Tom Slee eviscerate Chris Andersons inbox-stuffer, The Long Tail on his weblog, Whimsley. Because, remember folks, Abundance, like growth itself, is a force that is changing our world in ways that we experience every day, whether we have an equation to describe it or not. (p. 146)

Interesting that critics of neoclassical economics have almost caught up to what Ronald Coase said in 1937. The park example is the classic Assume nobody owns a given piece of property. Now, nobody treats it as though they own it. Clearly, ownership is the problem, which is a bit like criticizing modern medicine on the grounds that if you dont give anyone flu shots, lots of people will die from the flu.
 
The solution is to either make the park someones property, or set up your laws such that it acts as if it is someones property. That may not be the kind of world you want to live in, but its a world immune to Slees facile criticism.

Its not clear to me how to turn air into property in order to stop air pollution, but Ive added another example thats more directly market-based.

Air-as-property is one of the few markets for which a government (or multi-government) initiative is clearly and intuitively the best solution: emissions credits distributed on a per-capita basis would pretty quickly ensure that the only firms that polluted were the ones that created net wealth by doing so.
 
As far as the Wal Mart example is concerned, its rather hard for me to take seriously. Homogeneity is a characteristic that one entity has relative to another  in an increasingly Wal Marted world, the funky and original shops are proportionately more interesting. I used to live in a city just barely big enough for a chain bookstore, and at the time I thought Barnes & Noble was fabulous. Now I live in a city with a dozen or so B&Ns, including their flagship store  so I prefer cozier shops like Strand and Shakespeare & Co..
 
Id rather live in a city with cheap commodities and interesting alternatives than in a place where the alternatives had a monopoly.

Per-capita emissions credits are a government-instituted form of regulation. Sure, they happen to work by distributing a new form of property, but they still require government action to get around a collective action problem created by the markets lack of concern for externalities.

Almost. They arent a new form of property  theyre legal recognition of existing property. Clean air exists, and is enjoyed or exploited regardless of law. If our laws recognize that its a valuable resource, economic entities will treat it as such.
 
The market lacks concern for externalities if and only if you define it solely in terms of the two sides to any one transaction. Given that for any transaction, the vast majority of people are neither the party nor the counterparty, this is a limited definition  Id say that the market is the sum of all transactions, and that in this case externalities are side effects that arent sever enough per participant to warrant negotiation.

A big part of the lesson of WalMart is that the commodities arent actually as cheap as they seem: many of the costs that WalMart avoids still must be paid by someone, and often local and state governments are the ones who pay, through channels like increased stress on emergency rooms for WalMart employees with no insurance.
 
I think if WalMart was actually held to the federal laws which are supposed to regulate it: laws on labor organizing, employee compensation, environmental factors, etc., there would be considerably less pressure on smaller local businesses.
 
I can only speculate what the American economy and US cities would look like if public policy advanced the interests of small businesses, consumers, workers, and the community at large, instead of being so skewed towards huge corporate entities.  But to say these phenomena are purely the creation of the market, and government non-interference, etc. is to ignore quite a bit, IMO.  Of course, in many ways, the success of businesses like WalMart has to do with meeting real needs: Big chain stores bring new goods that were previously impossible to find, and commoditize many others to the point that more can afford them.  But that isnt the whole story by a wide margin.
 
It surprises me that there isnt more public discourse in America about these issues, because in Europe, for instance, local and regional products are heavily protected, advertising is deeply limited (roads arent plastered with billboards, television isnt blanked by pharmaceutical ads, etc.), and labor and consumer groups have immense government influence.  Its an open question whether one or the other system is more desirable, but at least I would expect vigorous public debate on these issues, instead of a unitary focus on cultural issues like gay marriage.
 
In other words, that WalMart wins and local businesses and products lose is in large part in the hands of public policy, and is directly due to the current political conventional wisdom about markets and their role.
 
Almost. They arent a new form of property  theyre legal recognition of existing property. Clean air exists, and is enjoyed or exploited regardless of law. If our laws recognize that its a valuable resource, economic entities will treat it as such.
 
This is absurd.  Clean air is not property, and to force it into such a framework is at best a way of hacking existing market-based mechanisms to deal with problems they arent really suited to.  Pretending that this is the natural order is just buying into a deeply limited conceptual framework which has little to do with the actual problems faced by government.

To add to the end of second section above.  The focus of our political system is on cultural issues, (or problems so big they cannot be ignored, like the blatant political corruption and abysmal foreign-policy failures of the current republicans), but the assumptions about economics and policy that make up the conventional wisdom are very seldom discussed in political debate, or at least not directly.  While particular policies are open to debate, there is little discussion of the need for the government to spend trillions of dollars on new weapons, the need to allow healthcare or media to be privatized and run principally for profits, the need for food companies to market directly to children, for drug manufacturers to market directly to consumers, or for need to subsidize coal and nuclear power.
 
These are taken as (more or less) fundamental truths in the current political climate, and this is deeply worrying to me.  Hopefully the Democratic party can begin to question at least some of these assumptions.  Im not very hopeful, however.

The basic premise here seems to be one playfully described by Garrett Hardin as CCPP  commonize the costs and privatize the profits and I was delighted to find a bit of his writings on the subject available here.
 
Hardin is best known for The Tragedy of the Commons which ought to have been called the Tragedy of the Mismanaged Commons, because there is nothing inherently wrong with a commons. Just that the mechanisms for controlling how individuals (and individual corporations) make use of them have more or less completely broken down.
 
I happen to think Hardin was one of the worlds great original thinkers who, alas, continues to be ignored.

Byrne - You seem to be taking Aarons generous review as an exhaustive description of my book. Im not the right person to judge whether the book is facile or not, but I do get a little bit beyond the point you are making. There are externalities beyond collective-action dilemmas.
 
I think Jacob Ruuss sentence captures my own point of view well: Clean air is not property, and to force it into such a framework is at best a way of hacking existing market-based mechanisms to deal with problems they arent really suited to. - as market logic extends further and further away from the trading of commodities, its tendency to treat externalities as an afterthought becomes more problematic.

Youd prefer to have the vibrant downtown to the Wal-Mart
 
Well, I think thats a case of inappropriate bundling.  It isnt that the you in this case prefers the vibrant downtown to the Wal-Mart, because thats clearly contradicted by his actions  if, overall, he preferred the vibrant downtown, hed have continued shopping there even though it was more expensive.  People do shop at more expensive stores when they prefer them, so theres nothing particularly weird about that.
 
But the hypothetical person here would still claim to prefer the vibrant downtown if you asked him on his way to pick up jeans at Wal-Mart.  The problem is that there are two separate preferences here: he prefers to relax and enjoy the vibrant downtown as a place to hang out, but prefers to pay for actual goods at the Wal-Mart rate.  Bundling these separate preferences into a single question obfuscates whats really going on enough that entire books can (and have) been written about it (before this one, I mean, if thats mostly what its about).

Randall, yes. But I think he was saying that theres an ordering over the states of the world (Walmart + Downtown) > (Downtown no Walmart) > (Walmart destroys Downtown). Theres nothing really bizarre or unreasonable about that.
 
However, what I dont understand is why we should be upset by this situation. Saying that you yourself want to shop at Walmart while still having a downtown to enjoy is basically saying that youd like someone else, whether it be the proprietors or other customers, to subsidize downtown. But of course youd like that; it doesnt particularly trouble me that you cant.
 
On the other hand, Im not sure how much of the destruction of these downtowns is really inevitable. It seems to me that while Walmart does provide lots of low-cost goods, theres all sorts of other things that they cannot (or at least probably wont) provide. Given the desire people have for vibrant downtowns, it would seem that creative businesspeople and entrepreneurs could find something to fill that void, coffeeshops, restaurants, gyms, or I dont even know what. Perhaps small-time stores tend to be complacent and reliant on a captive audience for their wares, and maybe that sort of situation is going away due to technology and other factors.

The proprietor may well cut this post, and I wouldnt blame him. But just to respond to Randall and the following post, here is the Wal-Mart vs. downtown section. It is in Chapter 1, and is not intended to be a detailed or exhaustive analysis - so please dont take it as such.
 
Jack lives in Whimsley. Some time ago Jack used to do most of his shopping in the downtown areaof course, he no longer doesand he also used to walk through the downtown before crossing Whimsley Park on his way to work.
 
Jack shares an eccentric trait with the other inhabitants of Whimsley: he has an odd way of making choices. As he goes about his daily life, when faced with a decision he assigns numerical points to the benefits and costs of the available options, and he chooses the option that gives the most points.
 
Lets follow Jacks reasoning as he thinks about what life was like when he shopped in the downtown area.
 
Value. I did much of my shopping at the two downtown department stores. They provided reasonable selection and price. They were worth two satisfaction points per week.
 
Variety. I liked the variety of the two stores. Sometimes I went to one store, sometimes the other, depending on what I needed, how much time I had, what other errands I had, and so on. The variety of having two stores was worth an additional two points.
 
Atmosphere. I assigned myself another two points each week from my enjoyment of the thriving downtown as I walked through it on the way to work.
 
Jack was happy to the tune of six points per week: two for selection and price, two for the variety of shopping options he had available, and two for the atmosphere of the thriving downtown.
 
A few years ago Wal-Mart opened a new store on the outer edge of Whimsley. Wal-Mart has huge economies of scale and tremendous bargaining power with its suppliers, and thus is able to offer the lowest prices. Like any consumer, Jack likes low prices. So Jack started shopping mainly at Wal-Mart.
 
For a while things were pretty good. Jack was happier because of Wal-Marts arrival in town. Here is his reasoning.
 
Value. By shopping mainly at Wal-Mart I not only continue to have a reasonable selection but I also get lower prices. So I give myself three points per week for price and selection, instead of the two I used to get by shopping at the downtown stores.
 
Variety. Whats more, Wal-Mart has extended my range of options: I assign myself an additional satisfaction point for the extra variety that Wal-Mart introduces, because on the days I dont feel like trekking out to Wal-Mart I can still visit one of the other stores and get what I need.
 
Atmosphere. There is no change to the atmosphere of the city, so I still get my two points for atmosphere.
 
Soon after Wal-Mart arrived, then, Jack was getting eight points per week: three from Wal-Marts selection and everyday low prices, three from the expanded variety he has available, and, as before, two from walking through the lively downtown to work. Jack was happier than before Wal-Mart built its store.
 
Of course, Jack was not the only person in Whimsley to be making choices, and that is where his problems started. Like him, many other people started to shop at Wal-Mart. The smaller department stores downtown started to have troubles, and gradually they went out of business.
 
Wal-Mart became the only department store in Whimsley. Jack had to shop at Wal-Mart all the time, like it or not. As a result, Jacks points for variety moved down to just a single point. Jack wanted more variety, but instead he got less. With the closing of the downtown department stores, Jack was down to six points per week again. He was as happy as before Wal-Mart came, but no happier. Thats not too bad. At least Jack was no worse off than he was before.
 
But Jacks problems did not stop there. Once the downtown department stores closed, the slower customer traffic in the area meant that other stores closed too. Now downtown is not so interesting anymore: a number of shops are boarded up, others have been replaced by dollar stores, and the buildings are shoddy. Jack does not enjoy walking past the rundown area on the way to work. It gives him no pleasure. No points.
 
Now Jack has only four points per week. He is less happy than he was before Wal-Mart came.
 
In the beginning Jack made a choice that he believed would make him happier, but now he finds that he is less happy.

The solution is to either make the park someones property, or set up your laws such that it acts as if it is someones property.
 
I have an example why this doesnt work in practice. I live by a city that burned to the ground in 1903 and was rebuilt in a peculiar architectural style called Art Noveau. The buildings are not the most glorious examples of Art Noveau (funds were limited), nor is it the place with most art noveau buildings (because it is a pretty small town), but the concentration is what makes the town unique.
 
Do you get my meaning? What is valuable is not any individual house, no matter how glorious, but the fact that there are so many of them in close proximity. Now how do we go about protecting this thing? I assert that it has great value for the local tourism business, and its probably worth a smaller amount to each of the citys inhabitants, but how can we protect our interests? Who shall own that which makes the houses greater than its part?
 
Its not a rhetorical question. The Art Noveau houses are being torn down at an alarming rate, because to each individual owner, that is a sensible ecenomic decision. Only a few particularly pretty building are protected by law, but thats not where the value of the city lies.

Title: Ode to a Blue Bicycle
 
For the longest time, I treated my bicycle as an extension of myself. I would strap on my helmet and jacket, fit myself into the seat, and firmly attach my arms to the handle bars and go. From then on, I saw myself as the bicycle. When I wanted to turn left, Id rotate my arms left and wed all move left. I didnt think of it as having the bike move left and staying on the bike  I thought of it as moving left. The bike was a part of me.
 
Its the same way I think of a car. You buckle into your seatbelt and suddenly you grow to become this huge hunk of metal that tears down the road. Moving left or right is now done through the steering wheel, but it still seems like youre the one whos doing the moving.
 
Body parts act kind of like our agents. When I want to raise my hand, I simply think to do so and my hand flies up. I let the rest of my body worry about the details. Similarly, when I want my bike to turn left I simply rotate the handle and let it use its momentum to wheel me over.
 
But heres the thing. I recently bought a nice, new, blue bike. And something strange happened. I stopped seeing it as an extension of my body, and started seeing it as just another tool. And suddenly riding it became a lot more fun.
 
I didnt have to stay attached to the bike all the time. I could keep one foot on a pedal and swing the other one over. Or I could go left while the bike went right, the two of us swinging back and forth in a counterweight dance. Or I could let the bike go ahead of me or behind me.
 
It seems counterintuitive that youd get more out of a bike when you started treating it as a tool. People speak in glowing terms of how their cars act as extensions of their body, a perfect meld between mind and machine. And maybe that makes sense for cars (theyre big and confusing enough that theres not much else you can do). But I think this is another case of the genius being in the details. Once I saw the bike as a bike, I could use it in ways that werent particularly intended.

The extension of your body effect is really strong, and its not only control but in reception. I once cut too close to some pedestrians in Boston, and one of them slapped my car. It was as shocking as if theyd hit me personally. Its not just me, I later similarly slapped a car that drove past me over a crosswalk one night, and the driver got out and swung at me (I got away unhit). But the identity with the vehicle goes quite far.

Title: Classism at Google
 
From the comments:
 
MOST PEOPLE who work at Google are in SUPPORT roles!! And they are getting paid way less than industry standard for working 50, 60+ hours a week for it! Screw the free food, screw the laundry - the MAJORITY of people working at Google are in buildings without any of these amenities, and are certainly without extra money from stock options.
 
[] they are the ones working their asses off, in overtime, but that doesnt matter because they are salaried but way below industry standards for support positions, to make sure that YOU, the user, has an accessible Help Center, has a kind, email response, has an answer to your question.
 
Yes, there are foosball tables in the support buildings, but who has time to play them? Giant overhead projectors alerting them to the current turnaround time for their emails is Big Brother enough to ensure that they dont even THINK about playing foosball when they should be answering support emails. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are not nice alternatives - they are NECESSARY to ensure that all of the support peons remain dutiful and consistent with their email turnaround times.
 
Wow, sounds like theyre overworked. Cant Google just hire more people? HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! For a response to that, please see the above comments. Its as hard to get a support role here if youre an MBA with a PhD as a hobby, as if you invented nuclear physics.
 
Ive been here almost 5 years, and as soon as my refresher grant has vested, I am out like Lance Bass. Its a load of corporate baloney - the 400-person company that I started at has become a nightmare that has eaten my soul. God help the users.

Oh right, I forgot, Google is keeping them there against their will by turning them into infants.  How clever!

Theres no reason for you to care about these comments, especially this one, which is anonymous.
 
Still, this blog is for you, to help shape yourself as an intellectual craftsman.
 
A craftsman would, before posting, do the following: verify (or falsify) the claim that the majority of Googles employees, or at least those in support roles, receive substandard compensation; and document the process through which it was verified (or falsified).  A true craftsman would never be satisfied posting without at least that effort.
 
Verifying jrs comment would require a more significant amount of work: you would need to conduct a representative series of interviews with underpaid employees at Google, in order to understand the reasons for which they dont offer their resignation.
 
Its too late to do this work before you post, but do it for yourself, anyway.

What in essence is being said is that, extremely  qualified, heavily screened support professionals are currently willing to work extremely hard for relatively lower pay by  just to be a part of Google.  While the anemities are just to make them less likely to leave the building.
 
And that Google does not see fit to hire other qualified support professionals because their standards are much too high - and would rather overwork their current staff at lower than industry standard pay as long as they are willing to put up with the situation.
 
And in essence, no one has complained to Google, and revealing blog posts are very very rare.

I read your blog with great interest. Sadly your objectivity has take a great hit in my eyes. Here is quote from David Pogue about a blogger taking something free:
 
Being provided an evaluation computer from Acer is not a bribe, argued blogger Blake Handler, after receiving one of the free laptops. It simply allows me to accelerate my evaluations, documentation and demonstrations of Windows Vista.
 
OMG! Youve got to be kidding me, Blake. I guess just being lent a laptop wouldnt have been enough to accelerate your evaluations? I guess only being given a freebie from Microsoft would do the trick.
 
Now, I realize it must be hard to send a shiny new laptop back to the mother ship just because its the right thing to do. Still, I think very little of the bloggers who are keeping Microsofts bribe laptops.
 
Clearly, theyre exploiting the lawless, Brave New World of the blogsophere, where, since theyre Not Quite Journalists, they dont feel constrained by any of those pesky journalistic ethics guidelines. Like the one that says, You dont keep $2,200 gifts from the subject of your review. You might think you can still write an impartial review, but its highly unlikely-and either way, nobody will believe it.
 
All people make mistakes. I hope that you learn from this one.

Title: Average People
 
College towns are funny. Im sitting in a small cafe, reading my little book, eating my little breakfast. Im the only customer around and the employees seem to have forgotten theres even me, so they start gabbing to themselves. The Mexican immigrant chef is chatting to the high school dropout waitress. Pause here and ask yourself what these two people might talk to each other about in their spare time. Try and think about what you might talk to them about were you in such a situation. Now recall that youre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They were talking, quite animatedly, about the demographic trends for marriage under European-style social democracy.
 
They quickly shut up when a girl walked in. The usual? asked the girl behind the counter. Yep, said the girl coming in the door. The order was prepared and delivered while the two girls chatted politely. Then the girl took her food and left. God, I hate her, said the girl behind the counter. I dont understand how an idiot like that goes to Tufts. She doesnt care anything about ideas.
 
College towns are funny.
 
Recently, Seth Roberts and I have embarked on an odd little project. Weve gone to various colleges in the area and asked kids why theyre there. The first day was at Berkeley and as I walked through Sproul Plaza at noon, kids of every shape and description trying to push fliers and come-ons in my face as I just tried to look around, I had a feeling it wasnt going to be easy.
 
Seth was wearing a tattered brown jacket and had a not-entirely-shaved face and, to be honest, looked a little odd. So when he went up to students and asked them if they had a minute, everyone said no. We went through five or six awkward such rejections until we realized that he should start off by saying he was a tenured professor at Berkeley. Nobody said no after that; apparently people initially thought he was a homeless person.
 
For right or wrong, Id come to think of random people as boring. In part, I think this is because Im shy, and I feel less bad about my inability to make conversation with strangers if I can persuade myself that the conversation isnt going to be worthwhile. After months of trying to make my way through desultory conversations with other Stanford students (What are you studying? Oh, I dont know yet. You? I dont know yet either.) I finally gave up and spent the rest of my time there with my nose in a book.
 
And part, perhaps, is that average people just have a really bad rap. Books complain about the anti-intellectualism of American culture. Professors complain about the students who dont care about the work. Newspapers complain about the ignorant red state-filling wingnuts. The average person seems like a dangerous entity, like the fellow at the lecture with the long and rambling not-quite-a-question that makes you think that maybe elitism isnt such a bad idea after all.
 
And who knows, maybe average people are actually like that. Maybe college towns are funny.
 
We went to three colleges: Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Berkeley City College. The colleges are quite different. Stanford is a large elite school for people who want to become professionals. (Id always heard this from my teachers, that Stanford was a place of people who were pre-med and pre-law and pre-grad school, but I wondered how big the effect was. As I was sitting down to interview our first Stanford subject, I wondered if wed interview enough people to be able to notice the difference. Thats when she explained that she was pre-med.)
 
UC Berkeley is a state school, although a respected one, with a large campus, although mixed in with an interesting city. (Stanford is almost literally surrounded by a moat.) And Berkeley City College is a junior college, in an attractive new building in the middle of the city, full of people who want to transfer out of there and into the real thing.
 
There were differences between the schools, of course, but more noticeable was the basic fundamental similarities. Everyone we spoke to, with one exception, was intelligent, articulate, had coherent thoughts about their situation and its place in the larger context, and was someone I enjoyed talking to. (The one exception was even more thought-provoking and made me wonder what it meant to be intelligent and why I felt so uncomfortable around him.)
 
Seth was much braver than I and took most of the brunt of the conversation, leaving me to observe and reflect quietly. But even just watching random conversations with random people was a thoroughly rewarding experience. I felt as if it was some essential task of humanity that I had heretofore neglected.
 
Everyone we interviewed stands out, but perhaps a few examples will give you the flavor of peoples situations. There was the young man at Stanford who had started a web-based business with his friends from high school. He soon realized that they were in an overcompetitive market and during his first year at Stanford had reconfigured their business plan to target a new space. Meanwhile, he planned to take business classes to get a more academic grounding in his profession.
 
There was the African-American girl at UC Berkeley who loved her courses in African-American Studies, how they revealed a secret history of her country that shed never before heard told. She couldnt see making a living in the subject, of course, but she wanted to study it while she could, before she had to find a real job. A job like, if she had to pick right now, probably teaching.
 
There was the Berkeley City College student who had done three years of college in Chile, spent a couple years in Germany, and now worked in Berkeley as a professional dancer, hoping to get college credit so she could get a job doing Latin American human rights work, ideally for the UN.
 
I am not sure what to say to these people. I understand the paths their lives are on and I see the flaws in the institutions in which they reside, but I have trouble imagining how I can fix things for them, as people. The problem with psychologists, sociologists complain, is that theyre too obsessed with individual people. And the problem with focus groups, even though they were invented by a sociologist, is that people are too obsessed with themselves. They see their problems, they see the context, and they reflect on them, but its not clear to either of us how they can particularly be remedied. The situations are just too big.

When people try to truly communicate and help each other in South American countries under the umbrella of United States control, they tend to end up chopped into several pieces in a black trash bag near the side of the road.
 
The mechanism for preventing communication and people helping each other is different inside the United States, but it is probably more effective.
 
The most effective way is to supply a set of resources, findable by motivated individuals.  And pray you are not discovered by the enthusiastic and well-compensated mob of servants of power.
 
Strangely, the right has better developed tools then the left.  Strangely, church groups do a better job of helping the completely disenfranchised.
 
It is almost as if the optimal way to proceed is to create a complete and rigorous analysis of class warfare, act strategically on this analysis, but never mention class, keep it a secret, hide yourself in plain sight among welfare organizations on the right.  Others will join, based on their own private analysis of class warfare, never spoken.
 
But that is silly!  Forget I mentioned it.  What a crazy and silly thing to say!

Aaron,
 
Youd be interested in and would possibly quite conducting this experiment at Oxford. The British university system is less flexible yet more rigorous.
 
The college system at Oxford throws a whole bunch of diverse subjects and nationalities together. My whole time there revolved around amazing random conversations over dinner, in the library, at breakfast etc etc.
 
The only thing that makes things a little harder is British understatement - not everyone feels its acceptable to approach strangers.

Title: Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Gdel
 

 
Gdel was a hacker. He attended the meetings of the Vienna Circle, one
of the most important philosophical groups in history, and sat quietly,
convinced they were all wrong. Others might try to argue them out of it.
Not Gdel. Perhaps (rightly) he thought that rational argument would get
him nowhere with people so detached from reality. So he decided to
prove them wrong.
 
The result was Gdels incompleteness theorem, one of the most
celebrated results in mathematics and logic, elegantly proving that any
mathematical system complicated enough to do basic arithmetic contains
statements which, while true, cannot be proven within the system.
 
But even this was to no avail, the Vienna Circle continued to insist the
proof was bogus or irrelevant. (The Vienna Circle insisted the world was
simply language-games, with rules and structures. Gdel, by showing
something that was clearly true to us but not provable from within the
game, thought he had proved that such things, like numbers, have an
independent reality.) Gdel, an incredibly odd and delusional figure,
remained quiet for many years, practically confiding only in Albert
Einstein, and little at all after Einsteins death.
 
This is a very bad book. It rambles and prattles and occasionally
repeats itself practically verbatim. (It is the result of a project to
improve science writing simply by paying famous authors to write about
scientific topics. Perhaps the payment should be contingent on some
measure of quality in the result.) But it is a compelling story and
Gdels proof is so brilliantly beautiful that it should be learned by
all educated people. I had never seen it presented in any real detail
before and once I got to its key principle I exclaimed and tossed the
book down and paced, admiring its brilliance. But there are many sources
who will explain the fairly simple idea. Id love to tell you about it
myself.

One of the best explanations of Gdels incompleteness theorem can be found in Douglas R. Hofstadters Gdel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid. The book is highly recommended and really a piece of art itself.

amix, congratulations on being able to get through GEB.  Id heard great things about the book and bought a copy when I saw it in a local bookstore.
 
Unfortunately, he struck me as the nerd equivalent of Wiliam F. Buckley, Jr. in terms of filling a lot of space (WFBJr loves to hear himself talk) while managing to say very little - at least thats what he did in the preface, which turned me off so strongly that I never got into the actual book.

I second amixs recommendation of GEB.
 
If you want a much shorter and more focused intro to Gdels first incompleteness theorem though, see the wonderful exposition of Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman. This last work is the one that piqued the interest of Hofstadter (and Gregory Chaitin and many others) in Gdels theorem when it came out in 50s.
 
There is also an excellent biography by John W. Dawson, Jr..

Not having read New Mind, Id be wary of Penroses exposition. He is a brilliant mathematician, to be sure, but he is also a mystical thinker, and I would be surprised if he didnt mix in, perhaps subtly, unwarranted interpretation or misapplication of the theorems.
 
Penroses approach seems to be: Hmmm, what would I like to be true?  Alright, now how would the universe need to be for that to be possible? And then he goes on to think up a brilliantly clever reason that the universe might be compatible with his desires. For example, quantum morality (scare quotes, not quoting Penrose), or the massless charged particle he postulates to get cyclical time.
 
Disclaimer: I could be misunderstanding and misrepresenting him  his lectures are difficult to follow.

You might be interested in E. C. R. Hehners version of the proof; see his paper Beautifying Godel for details.
 
The distinction between program and data, the use of the character string data type, the use of an interpreter, and counting from zero allow the proof to be reduced to three lines.

I second Brians recommendation to skip GEB. Its very cleverly written, but the insights it offers are few. For example: the author dedicates a sonnet to Russels paradox when a sentence would suffice. Its also guilty of jumping to the exciting popular science subjects - AI, DNA, robots, etc. - while providing little background or depth.

Its very interesting to read the proof itself, instead of the usual human-translation.

GEB is very lucid if extremely long-winded and tangential.  I had a great time reading it as a teenager.  I dont know if Id have the patience for it now.  But it presents Gdels proof in a way thats both complete (no serious technical gaps) and quite accessible to non-math people.  I later took the standard intro-to-mathematical-logic class (Math 125A at Berkeley) whose main result is Gdels proof, and found I already understood the subject pretty well just from having read GEB.  However, if you want a more serious (but still accessible) treatment from a standard math book, Herbert Endertons Introduction to Mathematical Logic is quite good.  It treats proof theory, model theory, and I think discusses axiomatic set theory to some extent, though he has a separate book for that.  Really, everyone should know a bit about this stuff.
 
Wikipedias coverage of these subjects is also quite good.  I guess Id start with [[Mathematical logic]] and follow the links from there.

I feel that the simplest way to understand universities is that they are bureaucracies sustained by transferring wealth from the state and alumni.
 
I dont see how to prove it, but I feel that providing a real educational experience to the undergraduates would have the risk of jeopardizing this wealth transfer.
 
Anyway, I need answers to three questions:
 
1) What groups or individuals are actually undergoing an educational experience (educational experience defined as mastering a body of knowledge either to (directly) form values and further goals, or (indirectly) learn general techniques of developing such a mastery; where this experience is directed by a specialist)
 
2) Is it possible for an educational experience to be provided to the general population?
 
3) Is providing a educational experience necessary for humans to experience the benefits of their worth and potential?
 
My guesses:
 
1) Practically nothing worth calling education takes place in any human society.  All successful education experiences occur in the margins in fleeting circumstances.
 
2) It is possible to provide an educational experience to the general population, but no wholesale technique will be effective.  The only effective route is to encourage individual teachers to lead small groups of individual students.  It would be the most expensive thing society would do, its expense would be far greater than any entitlement government currently provides.
 
3) Providing a educational experience is necessary for humans to experience the benefits of their worth and potential.
 
Now my main point
 
Why is the Internets so much better than providing pictures of lolcats than answering these questions?  Am I using my brower wrong?  Is there a Firefox extension I am missing?

Title: Our Underachieving College Presidents
 

 
It would seem absurd to claim that nobody cares about the quality of higher education. After all, anyone paying attention can name a dozen bestselling polemics off the top of their head  The Closing of the American Mind, The University in Ruins, Tenured Radicals, Higher Superstitions. But as Derek Bok points out in his quietly subversive new book, Our Underachieving Colleges, these commentators have treated universities largely as a punching bag for their political and professional views, rather than out of any genuine concern for the education of the students.
 
A classic example are the heated debates about what should be in the core curriculum. Should the humanities be required? Should things be focused around the great books? What about classes in writing and public speaking? Professors will happily argue about the proper allocation of required classes for hours, but youll never once hear them comment about the way in which these classes are taught. And without decent technique, it doesnt matter what the topic of the class is.
 
Bok shows deep familiarity with a largely-hidden literature about the effectiveness of college teaching. Nearly 80 percent of all college courses are simply lectures by professors, a stunningly ineffective form of teaching. By the end of a lecture, a student remembers less than half of what was taught. Only a week later, that number is down to 20%. At such stunning rates, its hard to imagine much is left after a month, let alone by the time the student gets out of college.
 
And yet nobody seems to care one whit. Bok is hardly to be excepted from this criticism. After the Larry Summers scandal, he was appointed acting president of Harvard University (and before that he was president from 1971 to 1991). Bok expects to only have the job for a year and no doubt his hands are tied in many ways  but rumor about campus is that he wants to make his year count. Yet Boks biggest changes have been a recommendation for more hands-on activities and the elimination of early admissions. Not bad moves, by any means, but hardly anything like the deep rethinking Boks book suggests is necessary.
 
But if Bok  a thoughtful and intelligent figure who has written eloquently about these problems  cant use his position  the most prominent spot in the entire field, with the deadline already on his head freeing him from any accountability  cant do anything about these problems, what hope do we possibly have? Opportunities like this come around once a century and it appears that Bok is going to blow it.

Doesnt the argument that you only remember half of what was taught in a lecture miss the point?  You can always make whatever point you desire by carefully choosing what thing to measure.  I never thought that the point of my college classes was to remember every single fact that was stated during the class.  The point was to use those facts and the relationships between them to learn how to think about the material presented.  Of course even that goal is not achieved very well, but lets at least be clear about what the goal is.  No method of teaching would result in the students remembering as many facts as are recited during a typical lecture.

A few questions:
 
What exactly is it that you expect Bok
to accomplish in his year as interrim
president, Aaron?  Big educational
institutions are slow moving beasts,
with complex traditions that take
generations to change.
 
What would you suggest as an alternative
to lectures, for professors to use as a
method of imparting their arguments and
evidence to students?  Its not like the
retention rate from reading a book is
particularly high either, but weve been
using books and lectures for millenia for
passing along academic discourse to each
new generation.
 
Note that at schools like Harvard,
lectures and readings are complemented
by discussion sections and papers, in
which students are forced to reflect on
the topics of the course.  Do you have
some better method in mind?
 
I think you have disproportionate expectations of Boks brief return to the presidency, and perhaps of the university presidency in general.  University presidents in general, and Bok in particular, have a caretaking role rather than a reforming one.  The best university president keeps an institution running smoothly, conciliating disagreements between different groups, and generally encouraging concensus in group decision-making.  This was one of Larry Summerss biggest problems; he tried to lead the faculty by strong-arm tactics, and they pushed back.
 
Undoubtedly there is always room for improvements and change in any institutions, and that is certainly true for both Harvard College (your essay seems to focus on undergraduate education) and Harvard University more generally.  But there arent any silver bullets here.

In solving problems in the real world, one has four variables: time, money, quantity, and quality. No doubt the a year as a university president is very high quality, but quantity is clearly fixed. As president he has access to some amount of the endowment and annual funds, but far from all of them. So, within those constraints, he can solve a certain number of problems. Im inclined to agree with Jacob Rus: Bok can grand-stand some paper-thin solutions to big problems, or he can solve some small problems well. Personally, given that choice, Id go for solving small problems well.

Harvard is an interesting case study because the amount of decentralization here is massive and legendary.  Making fundamental changes to a faculty like FAS cant be easy, and I imagine the best thing the new president of the University can do to effect major change in undergraduate teaching is to appoint a new dean for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with a strong vision for such change, and support him or her in the quest for reform.

Title: The Enemy Too Close to Home
 
How bizarre a book is The Enemy At Home, Dinesh DSouzas new screed insisting the left is responsible for Islamic extremism? Pretty bizarre. The books argument, according to the Times is that 1) that the American left is allied to the Islamic radical movement to undermine the Bush White House and American foreign policy; and 2) that the left is the primary reason for Islamic anti-Americanism because liberals defend and promote values that are controversial in America and deeply revolting to people in traditional societies, especially in the Muslim world.
 
Follow that? The left is allies with Islamic extremists because the extremists hate the left. Just like Dinesh DSouza. [W]hen it comes to core beliefs, he writes, Id have to confess that Im closer to the dignified fellow in the long robe and prayer beads than to the slovenly fellow with the baseball cap [Michael Moore].
 
In other words, it sounds like the right is allied with Islamic extremists in hating the liberal elements of American culture. What to do about this is left as an exercise to the reader.

The islamic fundamentalist situation has to be utterly confounding to right wingers. Prior to 9-11, an accellerating meme was that Christians, Muslims, and Jews would bind together into a monotheistic conglomo-religion in opposition to godless liberalism. See Peter Kreeft for the best example of this. Also, it cant help that the Bush familiy has longstanding ties to the Kingdom of Saud, who are major exporter of radical ismaili islam.

In reality both the islamic fundamentalist and the christian fundamentalist  seek to make religion the basis of secular power, and to subject democratic lawmaking to religious scrutiny and control.

Title: Getting Past
 
He called me into his office. It was an imposing room, wood paneling and a window opening on to a picturesque view of the water. An ornate light fixture hung from the ceiling, illuminating the mahogany desk, neatly organized with boxes OUT and IN, with a stack of paper, with a pad for writing on. There was no computer. He didnt need a computer. A computer would have ruined the look.
 
The walls were lined with bookshelves and the bookshelves were lined with management texts. Books on how to make people eat cheese, how to make them say yes, how to make them think positive thoughts, how to make them get rich. Books on locks and unlocking, thoughts and unthinking, beings and unbeing.
 
Take a seat, Geoffrey, he said, looking at me from behind glasses, a tailored suit hanging on his frame. I obeyed, as I always did. It was an order.
 
Theres been concern around the office, he said. No agent. Not people are concerned, not Im concerned, simply that theres been concern, as if it was some poisonous gas that had been leaking out of my cubicle, green fumes floating in mid-air.
 
Theres been concern that youre not being a team player. A sports metaphor. Here we are, all rocketing towards the goal, filing our TPS reports in tandem, and me? Im not being a team player. Im sitting in the corner playing Minesweeper or one of those online flash games with the little jewels. The teams let down. Im holding everyone up.
 
I think that the best way forward is for us to get past this, he explains. Isnt that always the case? If were on a path, and theres a rock, then obviously we have to go past it to go forward. We could go a different direction, but then we wouldnt be going forward anymore. But how did I become a rock?
 
Its clear to all of us, he says. But whos us? Theres only him here. Its clear to all of us that your hearts not in it. I imagine myself, lying on the surgery table, the bright light shining from above, with an army of hims surrounding me; theyre the us. One of him asks another for the scalpel, takes it, begins cutting out my still-beating heart. Aha, they think, his hearts not in it  its still in him.
 
They toss the heart in the trash and file out. They need to interview another job candidate.

Title: The Logic of Open DRM
 
In his recent essay, Thoughts on Music, Apple CEO Steve Jobs has called for the labels to stop requiring him to sell their music with DRM. Most of his argument is that the labels already sell the vast majority of their music perfect digital copies without DRM  namely, CDs  but he also argues that the alternative of having an open DRM system is impossible.
 
Jobs is less than clear here. He writes: There is no theory of protecting content other than keeping secrets. In other words, even if one uses the most sophisticated cryptographic locks to protect the actual music, one must still hide the keys which unlock the music on the users computer or portable music player. No one has ever implemented a DRM system that does not depend on such secrets for its operation.
 
Since this is a fairly important point and no one else is explaining what he means, I thought Id give it a try.
 
DRM works by encrypting songs. Encryption works by performing a mathematical scrambling operation that can only be reversed with the right key. As a very simple example, imagine you have the message hello and the key 5. One simple encryption system is to simply move each letter five letters forward (so a becomes f) and you get mjqqt. To decode it, you just need to know the number 5 and move each letter back that far. (This is a very bad encryption system, for a lot of reasons, but it works the same basic way as the good ones.)
 
The way DRM works, essentially, is that when you buy a song from the iTunes store its encrypted with a certain secret key (presumably one a lot bigger than the number 5). To play the music, you need the key to decrypt it. But the only software that has the key is iTunes and iTunes will only decrypt it if youre following their rules  only playing it on 5 separate machines, for example.
 
For Open DRM to work, Apple would need to give the key to other people who made music players. But as soon as Apple gives the key to someone, they can do whatever they want with the music. If the key gets out on the Internet, anyone can decrypt the songs. DRM only works because the key is secret. Open DRM is an oxymoron.

I thought this was such a smart move on Apples part, not only as a negotiating tactic with the labels (his note got top left attention on the cover of todays Wall St. Journalbut will it work?), but as a good-will winner for the public, especially after that NY Times article a few weeks back. I think the labels already know the DRM game is up, I think they have long known its up, and its time to move on.

Aaron, the typical DRM system is a bit more complex.
 
Besides secret (aka symmetric) keys there are public and private keys (aka asymmetric) of which only the private one has to be kept secret and hidden and the public one can be known and shared.
 
Content is typically encrypted by a secret key. This is an individual key per content and not known to the device prior to receiving the content. Its not a shared key as you assumed.
 
Now that key is wrapped by a public key and can only be extracted again by using the matching private key. Which public key? Each device must have a unique key pair. The private key might be stored on a smart card which is generally considered tamper proof. Most mobile devices work this way nowadays.
 
The associated public key is know sent to the service that will issue the wrapped key to the device. That service will be able to check whether that device is allowed to receive the wrapped key. It then wraps the encryption key so that only the identified device can unwrap it.
 
A device must never disclose the content key. Its manufacturer can be forced to assure this by contract. Using the smard card (or a trusted computing module) is one good way. The manufacturer will be sued if he creates a device that leaks the secret key. It is his responsibility to fix the leak or pay.
 
All affected devices - identified by the public key - can be excluded from further service. Because all keys are individually protected, one leaked private key cannot harm the system in general.
 
This is the way for example Microsofts DRM works. It IS practical to license it to third parties. Its more a thing of control and user lock-in than a technical problem.

Quite ironic coming from Jobs, considering no one is forcing him to put DRM on iTMS albums like Sleater-Kinneys Dig Me Out. (eMusic sells the same album DRM-free.) Jobs chooses to use DRM, presumably because its in Apples best interests (for the time being).
 
On a related note, Mike Hearn has an interesting post about the difficulty (impossibility?) of breaking hardware-based DRM systems:

Agreeing with Alan, I was confused about why Apple did not offer ANY songs without DRM.  It seems likely there are a number of artists who would not mind boosting their sales by selling their songs without DRM, and it cant be too impossibly technical to do this iTunes, since all theyd be doing is NOT encrypting songs that were flagged to be not encrypted.
 
I couldnt figure out a good explanation of why they would be doing this.  The thing from Jobs seems to indicate that they want music fans to direct their displeasure at the music industry giants.  It seems that if Jobs was at all anti-DRM he would have this option for publishers to not have DRM on their songs.  Any ideas?

DRM: I was only addressing software systems (like iTunes) in this piece, in which tamperproof cards are impractical and the public/private key bit is kind of irrelevant.
 
Alan: It looks like time has proved you entirely wrong about that.
 
Chris: My assumption was that the interface complexity for having both DRM and non-DRM wasnt worth it to Jobs for just a handful of indie artists.

Title: Neurosis #9
 
So here I am. Were somewhere over a dark patch in the middle of the country and Im in the window seat in the last row in the plane. The guy in front of mes leaning all the way back, but Im in the last row so my seat doesnt go back, and I have to lift my legs up to stretch out a muscle that was sitting funny while I was asleep. So here I sit, scrunched up in the the last row of the plane, my thighs hugged against my chest, my knees digging into the seat in front of me, my back curved funny from being unable to recline. But thats not the problem.
 
No, the problem is that I am terribly, almost unbearably, thirsty. My mouth has been dry for hours, were long past that. Now Im so thirsty that the color has drained from my face, because there simply is no fluid left to keep it there. I am so thirsty that its beginning to feel like theres no water around to hydrate my brain so my neocortex is getting and shrivelling up. Its an odd feeling, your brain shriveling up. It makes it hard to think. But I guess thats not really the problem either.
 
The problem, the real problem I suppose, is that I cant ask for anything to drink. I am perfectly justified  I was asleep during the drink service, I am quite terribly thirsty, my flight is unusually uncomfortable to begin with  yet I cannot bring myself to do it. As the flight attendants walk briskly by, I fail to catch their eyes. And the a man sitting in the seat next to me on the aisle has headphones on, so I cant exactly interrupt him. I could ring my flight attendant call button, but Ive never quite been able to bring myself to do that. Im so close to the flight attendants anyway.
 
If I rang the call button, I tell myself, I wouldnt ask for a Sprite. Id just ask for water. Asking for a Sprite, itd seem like I was interrupting them just so I could get my soda fix. Like I was some sort of petulant child who had to have his soda and was going to throw a temper tantrum if they didnt get it. Like a troublemaker, the kind of person they look down on. But water? Water theyd understand: it was a genuine medical request, a normal, physical human need. Something totally worth taking the extraordinary step of pressing the flight attendant call button.
 
But I cant bring myself to do it. It seems like such an imposition.
 
This, I suppose, is the actual problem: I feel my existence is an imposition on the planet. Not a huge one, perhaps, not a huge one at all, but an imposition nonetheless. When I go to a library and I see the librarian at her desk reading, Im afraid to interrupt her, even though she sits there specifically so that she may be interrupted, even though being interrupted by for reasons like this by people like me is her very job. At the fast food restaurant, I feel embarrassed taking time to pick through my pocket for appropriate change, so I always give them whole bills, then feel embarrassed when they have to take the time to count me out change. When someone asks me what high school Im going to, I feel awkward explaining to them that Ive gone to high school and to college and then started a company and sold it, so I just stutter a bit and then tell them that my high school is outside of Chicago.
 
I realize this is neurotic. Maybe not the high school thing, maybe thats just politeness, but certainly the thing right now, the brain shriveling with the knees digging and yet still the fear of asking for some water. This is neurotic, Aaron, I say to myself. You are being neurotic. It is not normal to be this shy. And geez, certainly you of all people have little justification for being so undemanding.
 
I am a good person, I mean. I work hard, I happily pay my taxes, I think of ways to make the world a better place, I always look the woman behind the counter in the eye and say thank you, thank you, as if I really mean it, as if I really do appreciate the effort it took for her punch my order into her cash register and withdraw the right amount of change. And I do! So I deserve this, I deserve my glass of water, my can of soda. I am not like one of those people who goes around robbing banks and mugging old ladies and then stands in front of me in the supermarket line, throwing a tantrum about how dare the clerk not accept my credit card. No, I am perfectly justified in asking for a glass of water. I know all this, and yet, somehow, I still feel like an imposition.
 
Normally, its not so bad feeling this way. Normally, I just sit in my quiet little room and do the small things that bring me pleasures. I read my books, I answer email, I write a little bit. Im not such a nuisance to the world, and the kick I get out of living can, I suppose, justify the impositions I make on it. But when life isnt so fun, well, then I start to wonder. Whats the point of going on if its just trouble for us both?
 
My friends will miss me, I am told. And I guess its somewhat better around friends. For some reason asking them for things doesnt seem quite so bad. Perhaps weve established some rapport, perhaps I feel Ive given them enough to justify my small requests, perhaps I feel like my friends are special people who think along the same lines I do and thus understand my needs. (Inner critic: Yeah, only a fellow genius would understand your special need for water. Jesus, what a dweeb.) But even so, I feel reticent. Even among my closest friends, I still feel like something of an imposition, and the slightest shock, the slightest hint that Im correct, sends me scurrying back into my hole.
 
I know, I know, Im wrong, Im wrong to feel this way. My friends love me. They remark, spontaneously, about how nice it is to have me around. They invite me over to their houses to hang out. Indeed, at this very moment, two of my very favorite people to hang out with are actually fighting  fighting!  over the supposed privilege of having me live with them. I just want to point out, one says, that I have never tickled you. I just want to point out, replies the other, that I have never gotten you to attach clothespins to your face.
 
Clearly, rationally, I am in the wrong. These people like me. (Inner cynic: If only to have someone around to tickle and pinch.) No, no, they genuinely like me. But the idea that people might actually want to be around me takes an amazing amount of getting used to. Last night, for the first time, I invited some people over to my apartment. Ive never done this before. But, to my amazement, they all came. They even brought their friends. I ran out of chairs. The idea that a group of people would want to come over to see me was kind of stunning. Someone even brought wine.
 
OK, so perhaps there is a small group of people who, whether through quirks of genetics or some childhood trauma, appear, as best as I can tell, to actively enjoy my company. (Inner elitist: Or just need excuses to drink wine?) But this does not excuse my impositions on the store clerk, the librarian, the man inquiring after my high school who I downright lied to  lied to!  just to avoid pointing out the error of his preconceptions, the bus driver who I had to distract with my inability to use the new stored-value payment machines, or the waiter at that restaurant I went to the other day who, I later realized to my endless mortification, I forgot to properly tip. (Waiter, if youre out there, please send me your address so I can mail you your tip! Im so sorry!) These people did not request the dubious pleasure of my company. I have no justification for bothering them with my requests.
 
Oh, but you know, I really want some water

Hi Aaron,
 
I hope this is a nap time or low blood-sugar level kind of a post, rather than feelings you are having all the time.  Heres my angle on it.  Im sorry if this advice doesnt seem to attack your actual problem but hopefully it will be useful.
 
I think a lot of people feel like this at least some of the time.  (Morrissey made a career out of it, even.)  My advice, for what its worth, is that you put your big intellect to work on the problem.  Im sure if you treat it as a challenge of that sort you can find some angle of attack that will help you with the problem.
 
Strangely, the best piece of advice about getting the courage to do things that I ever heard was in the movie Three Kings.
 
Archie Gates: Youre scared, right?
Conrad Vig: Maybe.
Archie Gates: The way it works is, you do the thing youre scared shitless of, and you get the courage AFTER you do it, not before you do it.
Conrad Vig: Thats a dumbass way to work. It should be the other way around.
Archie Gates: I know. Thats the way it works.
 
Once you accept that, you can do a scary thing knowing that it will give you the courage to do that same thing and other things like it in the future.

This made me smile, although it probably shouldnt. Its nice to know someone feels the same way as I do. I also make up white unnecessary lies just to avoid attention from other people. And I also feel awkward around even close friends (not to mention strangers), even though I know they like me. Its just a thing Im born with I guess. Other people just dont understand what the problem is - Im socially capable and all - it just really makes me anxious being around people sometimes. I guess therapy might help, but Ive never really looked into it.
 
On the other hand, I remember it was really nervewrecking when I was around your age (Im 29 now). It gets a bit better with age, so stick with it though.

Some of the behavior you describe, especially the unwillingness to bother others, sounds like introversion.

Also, the book The Introvert Advantage, although a bit pop-psy, is very informative.

Statistical thinking to the contrary, there really is only one you right here, right now.  Inspire yourself as you inspire others.  As someone said - I think it was you - dare to think big! ;-)

Well, its probably good that he is disclosing - and doing kind of elementary introspection lit(erature) thing. I believe thats what tend to be missing from regular/main stream Anglo-Saxon culture. (calling it exhibitionist and so on but alas in past 50 years or so counseling industry took hold of Americans.)

Its great for us spectators that hes disclosing, SPOBISJA, as he discloses so nicely, but hes also wrong about a few big things in such a way that may require someone well trained to interrupt or assist in his introspection. Repeatedly.
 
Clearly Aaron is as smart as people come, but everyone takes time off from being smart, or has things they arent smart about.
 
For example, if Aaron were to check out, that would be the biggest imposition he could possibly make on the people that he cares most about. It would be the largest possible amount of harm to the most people that anyone like Aaron could ever do. Either he cant figure that out because hes not equipped for it, or he knows that and theres some reason he leans towards that imposition anyway.
 
Both of those are problems that cant always be solved by brain power + introspection. Or casual friendly insight.
 
Aaron, I imagine, hopefully, that youre happily imposing on a therapist. If you arent, please start.

To me, the really interesting angle on this is that people like to be asked for help, for favors, to do things for each other.  Its how we feel useful.  When you forgo imposing, youre also declining to offer that person the chance to be involved in the world more, via you.  Of course, this varies with the favor and all, but if its something that you feel is part of who you are, and youre not already being asked for it too often, then the chance to give, to benefit another person, is a part of what makes life worth living.  I like to be asked.  I like to give.
 
But  you knew this, I bet. :)

I have such trouble imposing on others that I cant bring myself to fill out expense reports at work. It takes an extreme focus of will for me to overcome my not wanting to ask for anything long enough to send one of these in. Like you, being reimbursed for work-incurred expenses is something to which I am certainly entitled. In fact, I ask for far less in terms of supplies, etc. than most other employees with my company, and I complain very little. I just - can hardly force myself to do it.

Title: Justifications for Myself
 
Youre at a party and you find yourself sitting next to an rather geeky-looking fellow with thick black glasses. He looks like a nice enough guy and, after all, making smalltalk is only polite, so you ask him what he does. Im an entomologist, he explains. Oh, you say, stalling for time. An entomologist. You search your databanks for something you can say regarding entomology. Doesnt it get boring pasting all those little bugs onto those little cards? you say. He looks you straight in the eye. Actually, no, he says. Its not like that at all.
 
Michael Brub seems to often find himself as that man at the party. As an academic at a state college in Pennsylvania, hes surrounded by Republicans who want to cut off public support for tenured radicals like him. As a postmodern literary theorist who writes for public-interest journals, hes surrounded by those who think his field is meaninglessly obscure. As a professor of cultural studies, hes surrounded by those who think hes wasting his time researching trash. And as a cultural leftist with liberal political views, hes surrounded by friends who find his nuanced political views a personal affront.
 
In Rhetorical Occasions, Brub collects a series of essays, speeches, articles, and blog posts in which he tries his best to defend himself from all such charges. And while that doesnt sound like a recipe for good literature, he makes it work. Like my entomologist friend, Brub is such a kind-hearted, clear-spoken fellow that its fun to simply hear him out. The result is a book even better than Brubs 2006 bestseller, Whats Liberal About the Liberal Arts?
 
The difference is that this time Brub is writing for his fellow insiders, not outsiders, so instead of his cleaned-up defense of academic life and his tidied-up summaries of freshman classes, you get the real dirt on the way people dig knives into each other at MLA meetings and excerpts from graduate introductory courses.
 
The book isnt always perfect. Brubs writes clearly and well, but sometimes even his careful explanations assume a bit too much background from the reader. It sounds almost like a Monty Python bit, he says at one point; you expect to hear next that Alexander Kerensky was defeated by the experimental poetics of the Opoyaz group, and that the Battle of the Journals set the terms for the Second Congress of Soviets in October 1917. I have to admit, that was not what I was expecting to hear next.
 
And while Brub is fairly good about mentioning his opponents arguments (and this is a book with a lot of opponents, from ice hockey players to Stanley Fish), he sometimes responds to them with an obtuseness that borders on intellectual dishonesty. He notes that he was derided on the far left [for] my craven desire to break into corporate mass media by repudiating Chomsky. I wrote it for Context: A Forum for Literary Arts and Culture, [a journal] not available for purchase anywhere in the country. It is distributed only to independent bookstores, in print runs of five thousand. So I wonder just how much further from the corporate mass media Chomskys fans would like me to get before I am permitted to disagree with them. Its one of the books best lines, at least until you get a couple essays later when you find Brub reprised the criticism for an op-ed in the Boston Globe.
 
But the meat of the book is not in Brubs politics (which, reprising discussions between 9/11 and the war in Iraq, actually made me feel queasy), but in his academics. In even intellectual popular culture, its hard to find examples of postmodern literary theory that are anything other than critics taking a whack or exponents making it easy for them. Alan Sokal gets up and says that social constructionism is absurd and Stanley Fish fights back by insisting the rules of physics are just as manmade as the rules of baseball. Roger Kimball complaints that postmodern theorists are being deliberately obtuse and Slavoj iek responds by wondering whether Heideggers deconstruction of the metaphysics of subjectivity  undermine[s] the very possibility of a philosophically grounded resistance.
 
But Brub manages to make such debates seem comprehensible and, whats more, worth comprehending. Brubs passing references to Stephen Greenblatt, Catherine Gallagher, nancy Armstrong, Even Sedgwick, and Judith Butler makes you think that recognizing such names is as much a duty of an educated person as following Sokals references to Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and (as in famous footnote 26) Rebecca Goldstein.
 
I just hope there are more patient teachers like Brub to help one finish the job.

Title: San Francisco
 
So I find myself back in California, sings Quasi. And so I do. I spend half my life trying to get here, I spend the rest trying to get away. But here I finally am, and perhaps its time to simply give in.
 
California is large; it contains multitudes. Locals claim the peninsula is so big and irregular that it even contains microclimates  areas with different weather patterns. There is the glorious hill of Alamo Square, near the apartment I stay in, from which you can see the houses featured in the opening credits of Full House and watch the city stretch out below you. As you cross the street to head to the park, if you turn your head in the middle to watch for cars, you see a glorious road roll downwards, ending at a monumental city hall building, a glowing golden dome.
 
Or if you climb Twin Peaks, the hill overlooking Noe Valley, one night, the streetlights make the buildings below look like cardboard backdrops and a rolling grid of points of light sweeps out behind it, hills culminating in the tall buildings that make up the San Francisco skyline.
 
Or theres Valencia street, the oddball mix of pirate supply shops, burger joints, bike stores, hipster coffee houses and breakfast places, alongside restaurants of every ethnicity.
 
And, of course, the city is filled with brilliant and fun people. Marxist sex columnists, investigative technology reporters, self-experimenting tenured professors, crimefighting lawyers, activist technologists, startup founders, hackers, hipsters. I could hang out with these people forever.
 
Then one morning I awoke to find three of my favorite people inviting me to find a brilliant new place in the city and be their roommate. Its a hard offer to resist, no matter the city. Its the day before I leave for my Christmas trip to Europe and I promise myself that before I go Ill see the Sunset. I finish up all my work tasks and run as fast as I can to catch the streetcar that winds its way through the city, past pastel houses on rolling hills, past video stores and laundromats, past cafes and bakeries, past offices and parks.
 
And then we hit the end of the peninsula, a road and then a hill and then a beach. And there it is, just like in LA, the sun setting right before me, casting a glow over the beach. And the fog is rolling of the hills in the nice lines that you thought only existed in heavily photoshopped pictures and you watch the waves on the beach roll up to your feet and the beauty overtakes you and you fall back against the hill and theres really only one thing you can say, even if its to no one but yourself:
 
Alright, San Francisco. I concede. You win.

Title: Cambridge
 
Theres something magical about Harvard Square. Ive hardly been all over the world, but Ive been a bunch of places, and nothing can quite compare to the electricity I feel every time I visit this spot in the center of Cambridge.
 
One one side, the gates of Harvard University. On another, the campus book store. On the third, a pit where kids hang out and bands sometimes perform and street performers crowd around. On the fourth, a shopping district.
 
Cut down Dunster and you find yourself facing the Harvard Lampoon building. Follow the road a bit and youll see the mix of shops and Harvard dorms. Keep going and youll find the riverside. If its a fall day, the trees will be turning brown and the sky and river will be blow and a couple boats will be rowing down the stream and youll breathe in the air and wonder if there could ever be any paradise more perfect.
 
Across the river is the tree-lined campus of the Harvard Business School, but turn back up JFK Street and youll see hotels and shops and cafes and parks and boulevards. Everything youll ever need is there and cars and people intermingle, looking content.
 
Make a left on Brattle and follow it a ways and youll see a little dip in the street. Another singer has set up shop there and kids are sitting on the stone slab in front, listening to the songs, lying on their backs, reading books.
 
Stop into the Coop or the Harvard Bookstore and you can pick up a book of your own. Or cross the street into the famed Harvard Yard, the tree-lined quad where college students sit and run and walk. The paths meander past the dorms and classrooms, open up in parks with cafe tables where vendors sell sandwiches, close up again to head towards the library.
 
The library, the big building right in the middle, a giant edifice in praise of collected knowledge, its big stone steps streaming down as if to say you too may be elevated. Inside, the soaring archways, the countrys largest library (after the Library of Congress), the floors and floors of stacks, the underground additions, books seeping into the groundwater of the campus.
 
The knowledge infects everything. Kids in the street talk about the arrangement of bones, the politics of the economy, the topology of mathematical spaces. Even the service staff get into the act: as you sit in a cafe, the college dropout clerk argues with the immigrant cook about the political necessity of marriage and the status of its legality in various countries.
 
The seasons come here, just as you imagined: the sweltering heat of summer, the overpowering beauty of fall, the snow-capped vistas of winter, the budding excitement of spring. There is a city, an ocean, a river, a suburb, a harbor, and a bike path. There is a subway, but its not strictly necessary. The city is small enough that it can be walked across, simple enough that it can all fit in your head. Its not a place that you can soon forget.

Agreed. Its been years since Ive been in Harvard Square, but it used to be one of my main stomping grounds.
 
I love the Out of Town News stand (is it still there?).
 
Weekends when all the street musicians are out in full force are also great. I used to especially enjoy this one fellow who would do little puppet shows with marionettes.
 
The little sidestreets are great too. Nothing like twisting your ankle on an uneven brick or coblestone as you trot across these old-school surfaces (and Im not being sarcastic here).
 
I just hope the gentrification and chain-ification of the Square hasnt completely ruined its unique  charms.

Title: Stockholm
 
Visit Swedens National Gallery and youll see grand murals, elegant sculpture, classical paintings. Its exactly the kind of thing youd expect from an ornate old building across the street from the royal palace. But one floor down youll find something that seems rather out of place: an art exhibit with copyright in the title.
 
The exhibit, a brochure explains, links up with todays debate about illegal downloading of music and film files from the Internet. Itd be interesting enough if illegal downloading was such a live issue that art galleries were using it to try to get kids to come visit (can you imagine the Art Institute of Chicago promoting an exhibit by trying to claim it was related to Grand Theft Auto?) but the exhibit actually lived up to its claims: it was a penetrating investigation of what it means to be a creative artist in the age of mass production, one of the most thoughtful art exhibits Ive ever seen.
 
Copyright is still a live issue here in Sweden, perhaps best illustrated by the now world-famous The Pirate Bay website. Despite the sites arrogant name and attitude (Im running out of toilet paper, so please send lots of legal documents to our ISP, they replied to one legal complaint) what it provides is apparently quite legal in Sweden. The site is a BitTorrent tracker, helping your computer get in touch with others who are sharing (usually copyrighted) files. Because it only assists in copyright infringement and doesnt do any copyright violations itself, the Swedish government has had a hard time shutting the site down.
 
Not that they havent tried  the MPAA pushed the government into raiding and seizing all the servers of the Bay and their ISP, prq.se, including servers for websites that received special government protection as media outlets.
 
The Pirate Bay was originally a project of Piratbyrn (lit. Piracy Bureau), a Swedish activist organization created to combat Big Contents Antipiratbyrn (lit. Anti-Piracy Bureau). The organizations spokesman, Rasmus Fleischer, has become something of a household name in Sweden. Journalists now regularly call the Piratbyrn for responses to claims by the Antipiratbyrn and Fleischer regularly gives talks on the topic of piracy. When I met him he was getting ready for a Vanity Fair photo shoot the following day.
 
Random people on the street here have attended Rasmus Fleischer talks. Indeed, random people on the street here work with famous computer scientists, random people on the street use reddit, random people on the street pirate files. Stockholm has odd streets.
 
At the same time, a third organization  the Swedish Piratpartiet  is trying to change the laws through electoral mechanisms. Despite being a fairly single-issue political party, in their first election, they won .63% of the popular vote and is now bigger than the Swedish Green Party. (In school mock elections, it won a whopping 4.5%, which gives you some idea of its political base.)
 
But dividing up the parties into clearly separate organizations isnt the most sensible way of looking at it. For the most part, the organizations consist of IRC channels where friendly people sit around swapping notes and working on little projects theyre interested in. For a non-profit, such a structure sounds hideously disorganized. But its precisely how most free software projects get developed.
 
A kid drops out of school to intern with the pirates. Some filmmakers put together a documentary on the subject. Journalists file freedom of information act requests to reveal whos really behind the Pirate Bay raids. Kids post fliers for the Pirate Party. It smells like the beginnings of a movement.

Just a clarification: Piratpartiet has more members than the Green party, but not more voters. (I think it helped that the membership fee is less than a dollar, and free if youre younger than 26.)
 
The Green party got 5.24% of the vote in the election last year and you need at least 4% to get into the Riksdag, so Piratpartiet has quite some way to go until they will be able to make a difference.
 
In some ways theyve already succeeded: most parties have reconsidered their stance on filesharing after Piratpartiet showed up in the media, some even reversing the position they took when they voted on the issue two (I think) years ago.

Title: Dresden
 
Hop on a train from Berlin and before you even notice your eyes have closed youll be waking up in Dresden. The streets are dark but the light pours out from bars and you make your way down a sidestreet to your quirky, beaten apartment and tumble into bed, ready to wake up and tackle the next morning.
 
And what a morning it is: the sun shines through a solid gray sky, giving everything a cast of history and emotional depth. This is how Europe was meant to look  a bridge stretches across a sweeping river to a skyline of grand and time-battered buildings. A man plays old songs on an accordion and you follow the twisting cobblestone streets through the kind of grand edifices that only kings would build.
 
Upscale shops are mixed in with the glorious old buildings, people bustle every which way, and a fantastic network of streetcars takes you wherever you wish to go. Shops and cafes open onto picturesque views of a city with more charm than you could dare to hope for.
 
The skyline is made up of churches and synagogues and government buildings and hotels and art museums and schools. The center is surrounded by districts of hip bike stores, clothing shops, restaurants. A church with the top blown off is now used for concerts and parties. Apartment buildings have been built in bomb craters.
 
There are few places that live up to the beauty of the imagination  Harvard Square exists romantically only for a few days in the fall. But here is Dresden, the picture of beauty, in the heart of Europe. The riverbank sweeps majestically and curves past you and heads off into the distance as the sun sets into its flowing waters. And then you head home.

You can never compare Dresden with Munich, they are just too different. It is like comparing New York with London, you can not rule out one, you have to see both.
 
Yes Munich is beautiful, buts its a kind of beauty that youll find anywheree in Europa, in Vienna, Rome or Paris. Dresden has a Beauty that can be found nowhere else; the only places that come close to Dresden are the Italian cities, but even they are different, it is hard to explain.
 
Dresden is a bizarr mixture of incredible beauty  in a small city center, surrounded by ugly concrete blocks and large empty spaces in the inner city; the debris has been cleared but those sites still breath the tragedy of the largest destruction of a city in Europes History. Many sites of the former beauty survived the war, but then the Communists blew up what was left; Dresdners called this the 2nd Destruction of their City.
 
In Munich youll have a good Time. Dresden will touch your heart.
 
I am partly of Jewish origine myself, my Grandmother and my Grand Uncle, famous Author Kurt Baschwitz, survived the Holocaust. But still, it bothers me why only the crimes to one part of my family are recognized, whilst crimes to the other part are not. I love both parts of my familiy, the German Christians and the German Jewish.
 
Americans and British should become honest and start banning Bombs on innocent Civilians. It was ordinary Germans who risked (AND LOST) their lives in order to save my Grandmother. And it was Allied people, who finally betrayed them. It is high time for America and England to revise their stereotypes.
 
The truth has to be spoken, but now i wish you a good trip to Europe and please help us rebuild Dresden. Reconstruction of large parts of the historic old town is only starting now! Modernist Architects and incompetent urban city planers try to implant vile ugly blocks into the historic sites, we are the trying to prevent this. Please help us prevent Dresden from being destroyed a 3rd time.
 
This is one of Europes most beautiful cities, Dresden belongs to all of mankind, regardless of race or ethnic origine. Please help us rebuild,  i am not talking about money, i only ask you to inform yourself - in case you are interested.
 
Thank you, and all the best

Title: Berlin
 
A giant death star-like ball hovers over Berlins Alexanderplatz, a remnant of the Cold War struggle to seem powerful. Its lit from underneath, casting it an ominous glow, just the kind of comically-evil thing youd see in a bad movie.
 
Just across the way is a childlike spaceship standing in front of a glowing dome and inside  well, inside, as a person at the desk put it in their thick German accent, everything is a little bit chaos.
 
The Chaos Communications Congress has taken over the building. The dome on the top floor is filled an ongoing series of interesting talks, the lounge underneath it is filled with couches and rugs and rocking music for people to hang out, and the floor beneath that is filled with people in front of monitors watching the warm glow of computer code scroll by. The place is filled with hackers.
 
I dont particularly like computers, but theres a definite charm to these peoples cast of mind. They like to get stuff done. There are tables with soldering irons and pliers and lego blocks and cubes of blinking lights and animation software and magnifying glasses and more. One group has built little blinking tags that figure out which room youre in and report it to a central server. Another has shown everyone how to purchase VOIP phones from the electronics store across the street, hook them up to a conference network theyve built, and then return them when the conference is over. Others are showing off the stuff theyve built, from software that can let you surf the Internet completely anonymously to laptops that can be distributed to the Third World for $100 a pop.
 
For these people, theres no separation between work and fun. Its not like other conferences where you sit during the day in quiet seats taking notes on carefully preselected talks and then spend the nights out drinking with your buddies. You can spend the days drinking and the nights listening to talks, each blending into each other, with games and working and gabbing on the side. Couches next to lectures, couches in lectures, lectures from couches.
 
Even if you dont like the subject matter, you have to admire the atmosphere. What other group has a place like this, existing somewhere between occupation and hobby and subculture, between conference and convention and hangout? Its fun, its educational; its occupation, its friendship; its building, its destroying. It is, indeed, a little bit chaos.

Title: The Fundamental Law of Sociology
 
There are some loons on the Internet trying to spread the idea that the fundamental law of sociology is the black-white test score gap. Put aside the fact that anyone who would even think of proposing such an absurd thing must be a raving scientific racist.
 
And put aside the fact that they must also be fairly stupid, because such a claim is, at best, a discovery about a particular society, and not a law. (Can you imagine someone claiming that falling objects accelerate at 32 feet per second per second is a fundamental law of physics?)
 
Even put aside the fact that no actual sociologist would even go near such a claim, as the fields entire purpose is to investigate social causes of such phenomena.
 
No, let us look at an actual fundamental law of sociology, the Thomas theorem. The Thomas theorem says If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.
 
Now think about what that means about claiming the black-white test score gap is an immutable law.

Assuming all people deserve to enjoy all the benefits of their innate worth, and assuming all people deserve to enjoy all benefits of their potential
 
1) How do you best help them as an individual?
 
2) How do you best help them as a member of their social-economic group?
 
There are people who will not sign up to the simple framework outlined above for releasing positive human potential and engage in the implied consequent analysis and actions.
 
For whatever reason, they dont wish to sign up.
 
I am inclined to treat those people as brain damaged.  Speak to them slowly, make no sudden movements, place their wallets inside of their mouths lest they choke on their own tongues.
 
In other words, if I come across a socio-economist sunk into a trough of pig filth, I trod upon his head to keep my pant cuffs from becoming soiled, and continue walking along.  I dont stick around to listen to his gurglings.

Title: Last Day of Summer Camp
 
Ten calls are coming through on my cell phone at once. I try to answer them in order. Finally I get to my mom. Just wanted to see how you are, she says. Oh, by the way, Alexis called the cops. I try to treat this as nonchalantly as she is, but mean while Im running to find my pants. I don my gray hoodie, grab my keys, lock the door behind me, and run out into the street, finally saying goodbye. I just make it  I see the cops coming in front of my door as I make it to the next block.
 
I know exactly what to do in these kinds of situations; Ive seen it in all the movies. Turn off the wireless on the cell phone, pay for everything in cash, dont use RFID cards, stick to sidestreets. I stick to sidestreets, but I still hear the cop sirens buzzing down all the major roads. There are major roads on every side of me.
 
The lady across the aisle from me on the plane is pleading with the flight attendant. She holds her small dog between her legs (oh, dont worry, she had explained, hell stop barking once we take off), covered in only a blanket. The attendant is down on his knees, trying to understand what she wants. He disappears and later I see the woman pouring a small bottle of alcohol into her drink.
 
Apparently this was a mistake. The woman starts screaming profanity, locking herself in the bathroom, running up and down the aisles. Finally, shes forcibly restrained. The pilot comes on loud over the intercom, thanks us for our patience, explains that youre not supposed to mix alcohol with certain psychoactive medications, tells us law enforcement will be meeting us at the gate.
 
Law enforcement meets us at the gate. Please remain in your seats, comes the pilots voice. Law enforcement has taken control of the air craft. No one is permitted to move until law enforcement releases its control of the air craft. Law enforcement relinquishes the air craft and as I exit I see the woman, with a couple policeman in front of her, asking her if she can see the fingers theyre holding up.
 
God, I think. Didnt I just go through this yesterday?
 
I forgot how much I hate San Francisco. The bus takes an hour to arrive, while I have to stand in the human filth of the city. For some reason they put the major bus transfer point at the same place drug dealers congregate. Its not a very fun place to wait.
 
I finally get home and tumble into the mat that makes up my bed.
 
Next thing I remember Im in the Moscone Center. MacWorld is over, but a few signs and people are still around. I look out a window for a bit and a guy taps me on the shoulder. I think theyre trying to punk Paul Graham in that room, he says, pointing. I go and see.
 
Paul Graham is indeed in that room, as is his girlfriend and my co-founders and the other Y Combinators I know and a bunch of people I dont recognize (probably this years batch of Y Combinators). They start surrounding me. I begin to suspect a trap.
 
Whats going on here? I ask Steve. Wait a second, you brought me here, didnt you? What are you talking about? Steve replies. I mean, I remember going to sleep, I remember kind of wanting to wake up, but then all of the sudden Im in the Moscone Center? How did I get here? You must have brought me here, didnt you?
 
Steve denies all knowledge, but theres a gleam in his eye.
 
The people surrounding me take a step closer.
 
Alright, I say. Ill make a deal. If I can tickle every last one of you, I go free. Otherwise, you win.
 
They seem to accept the deal.
 
I begin tickling.
 
People begin running, dodging, flying around the room. But Im like a heat-seeking missile. I track down every one of them, extend my hands out, go straight for their armpits.
 
I win.
 
I wake up on my mat. The sun is shining brightly. Its a beautiful day. I whistle a happy tune. I go to wait for the bus. One bus goes by, its too full to stop. Another comes by after what seems like an eternity. Its almost as full, but Im not going to wait for yet another. I hang from the bar overhead, just barely fitting inside. Theres no room for my feet.
 
The bus gets off a couple blocks from my office. To get there, I have to walk past the Moscone Center. Thats when it comes back to me. I look hard at the Moscone Center. Oh, I say. It must have been a dream.
 
Goooood Monday morning, I say, entering my office. Thats kind of my little thing, my little ritual. Goooood XXX morning, I say in a happy voice, replacing the XXX with the name of the day Im saying it on. I only say it once each day.
 
My co-worker is ignoring me.
 
I am presented with a letter accepting my resignation. I am told to collect my personal effects. A woman from HR politely escorts me from the premises. She never says that she is escorting me, but she does stand behind me wherever I go. I think I am supposed to leave.
 
I leave. The sun is shining brightly. Its a beautiful day.

Title: A Moment Before Dying
 
There is a moment, immediately before life becomes no longer worth living, when the world appears to slow down and all its myriad details suddenly become brightly, achingly apparent.
 
For Alex, that moment came after exactly one week of pain, seven days of searing, tormenting agony that poured forth from his belly. Alex never liked his belly. Growing up he was always fat, surrounded by a family of bellowing, rotund Americans, who had a room in their house with wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling cabinets, all entirely filled with bags and boxes of various pre-processed semi-organic assemblages, which they used to stuff their faces at all hours of the day.
 
Alex had body image issues. Hed avoid mirrors because he couldnt bear to look at himself, his large bulbous cheeks obscuring his fine features. He avoided photos, covering his face or ducking out of the way when the click of the camera came, for the same reason: he didnt want to be confronted with the physical evidence of his disgusting nature, thought he could not go on living if he had to face the truth.
 
It wasnt until he got away from his family that he discovered his weight was not an immutable characteristic, like the fingerprints he often mused about burning off, like the dental records which had caused him so much adolescent anguish, like the DNA hed heard so much about in school. He would take off his shirt and stare at his stomach in the full-length mirror. It was there, of course, hideous as ever, but also appreciably smaller. Its size, he realized, could change.
 
So Alex starved himself. Cut down from three meals a day to simply two and then to only one. And even that became superfluous most days. Alex simply wasnt hungry.
 
He watched his stomach dwindle, monitored his progress on the electronic readout of his at-home scale, charted the numbers on his computer, admired the plunging trendlines.
 
He was doing so well. He told all his friends. The secret to losing weight, he would explain, is simply not eating. You just get used to it after a while. He looked at the beggars outside his window and refrained from giving them change so that they too could experience this miracle. He changed the channel when the radio began speaking about starvation in Africa. Starvation isnt so bad, he scoffed. You get used to it after a while. He wondered whether the USDA thrifty food budget could be further reduced.
 
He stopped going out. His friends always wanted to meet him for meals, or for drinks, events in which Alex simply wasnt interested anymore. Before long, Alexs friends were no longer interested in him.
 
Alex started eating in cafs, ordering a small pastry, sitting in a comfortable chair, listening to the music play over the loudspeakers. Soon he stopped doing even that.
 
Alex read on the Internet about death. There was a theory, increasingly well supported, that eating is what killed you. They found that rats on extremely restricted diets, rats who ate very few calories, lived impressively long. They saw the same results with other animals, up to and including chimpanzees. They suspected, but could not prove, the same was true of humans. Every little bite of food was another step towards death.
 
Alex started eating again. His appetite grew as slowly as it had declined but within months he was back to eating three meals a day. Food suddenly gave him pleasure again. He savored the tastes on his tongue.
 
One night he and his friends decided to try a new restaurant. But when the food came, Alex couldnt eat it. He thought it smelled funny. He let it sit there, his plate lying on the table, his food seething, untouched.
 
The next night Alex couldnt sleep. Hed wake up, feeling searing pains in his stomach, as if the food winding its way through his gut had spikes and was tearing apart the walls of his intestine.
 
He suffered like this for days, rolling on the floor in agony, unable to resist eating but every bite he ate causing him unimaginable pain. And still, he could not stop.
 
Five days in, it seemed like the worst had passed. The pains came less frequently, the pains were less intense. He actually slept that night.
 
The day Alex killed himself, he was awoken by pains, worse than ever. He rolled back-and-forth in bed as the sun came up, the light streaming through the windows eliminating the chance for any further sleep. At 9, he was startled by a phone call. The pains subsided, as if quieting down to better hear what the phone might say.
 
It was his boss. He had not been to work all week. He had been fired. Alex tried to explain himself, but couldnt find the words. He hung up the phone instead.
 
The day Alex killed himself, he wandered his apartment in a daze. The light streaming through the windows gave everything a golden glow, which had the odd effect of making the filth hed become surrounded with seem cinematic.
 
Alex wanted to go outside for one last meal, but he had trouble making the appropriate connections. Jacket, shoes, pants, wallet. Each lay in a different spot upon the floor. Alex knew they went together, he drew lines connecting them in his minds eye, but it didnt see to fix anything, his eyes just kept bouncing from one item to another.
 
Finally, he summoned the intelligence to put them on. The world seemed funny afterwards. He noticed the way the key turned in the lock, like a hand rotating in front of his face, an interplay of light and shadow, objects in space. He noticed the packages sitting at his doorstep, begging him to open them, but their labels insisting that they were addressed to someone else. He noticed the frail old ladies who refused to obey the walkdont walk signs and instead walked slowly, backs hunched, across a major intersection.
 
He went to a new caf across the street, the one place he hadnt been to yet. Light streamed in through the huge picture windows, making the whole place seem bright and airy. So much light, in fact, that the outside seemed a glow, as if the caf was suspended in the middle of a powerful white light. People held lowered, indistinct conversations. People on his left, people on his right, people behind him. But one conversation seemed to be coming from the ceiling. It might have been a trick of the acoustics. He looked up and saw two speakers staring back at him and listened closely.
 
The caf was not playing music. It was playing a recording of two peoples lowered, indistinct conversation.
 
The day Alex killed himself, he had a sudden, powerful craving for a Key Lime Sugar Cookie. It was odd the power the Key Lime Sugar Cookie had over him. Alex did not particularly like limes of any sort. In fact, the idea of an actual actual, as with all fruits, thoroughly disgusted him. He hated how when he ordered sparkling water at fancy restaurants they would place a lime wedge on the top of his glass, how he had to confront the disgusting object every time he tried to take a sip, how touching the lime, even to remove it, was so digusting as to be simply out of the question.
 
And yet, here it was, this cookie, with the lime flavor baked into the center and large transparent grains of sugar embedded in the top, begging for him, begging for one last taste. The cookie was sold exclusively by a publicly-traded chain of cafs that tried hard to seem international, giving itself a foreign-sounding title and printing the names of major world cities on every door, even though it had not expanded much beyond the eastern half of the United States. Alex purchased the cookie.
 
He noticed the way he couldnt quite form the words to request it, simply presented the cookie in front of the cashier and twitched his head, assuming (correctly) that in context the request would be understood. He noticed the way his hands moved haphazardly to remove the appropriate amount of money from his wallet. He noticed the way his change spilled out onto the counter as he tried to find the quarter with which to complete the transaction. He noticed the way he wobbled as he walked as he took the now-purchased cookie outside.
 
The day Alex killed himself, he savored his one remaining cookie, the sweetness of the embedded sugar grains, the bizarre flavor of what must have been lime. He used his tongue to wipe the remaining crumbs from his teeth, tossed the now-empty bag it had come in into the trash, and stepped out into the middle of the street.

It neednt be this way, for there is a cure: the joy of life. Sanity can be restored through attempts at music, channeling the fundamental disorder into form and elegance, focusing the energy toward good. Art, especially the art of nature, as Alexander suggested, is likely another cure.

There is a vegan Vietnamese restaurant nearby me that also serves raw food.
 
The raw food dishes are as strange as you would expect, but not inedible.
 
I eat what my wife cooks.  Because I dont wish to be struck down by the pure wrath of an angry little lady.
 
My wife cooks meat.  I eat meat.
 
But if I was serious about losing the 60 extra pounds I have accumulated on my 61 frame, I would go the raw food route.
 
God bless America and modern agriculture and food distribution.  It allows for a raw food diet to be varied, delicious, nutritionally complete, and affordable.
 
I love meat.  Love it, love it, love it.  I would eat a baby (if properly prepared).  But if meat-eating becomes as looked-down-upon as cigarette smoking (banned it all public places in California), it would probably be a good thing for society and the planet.  And me.

Title: The Capital of Scandinavia
 
Sweden is a fascinating country, although it doesnt appear that way at first. The Stockholm airport tries hard to sell you on the citys importance, lining the walls with the faces of famous residents, none of whom I recognize. Stockholm is The Capital of Scandinavia, at least according to the wall, the information desk, and the You Are Here signs spread around the city. All the signs are in English as well as Swedish and we didnt see a single person the entire trip who couldnt speak English (although one declined to).
 
Nor does the ride from the airport suggest anything special  the road is lined with the office parks of big companies, much like the streets of Silicon Valley. And the city seems, well, like a city, at least until you realize thats your apartment, not simply downtown.
 
Most American cities are still suffering from the urban planning designed to keep non-existent factory fumes away from peoples homes. Even in San Francisco, where all sorts of crazy things are crammed into one small peninsula, there is still a clear separation of residence and business  blocks of victorian row houses, then a cross street with a bunch of shops.
 
But as far as I could tell, Stockholm doesnt have any such residential zones. All the apartments seemed to be on the floor above the normal street life; the two deeply intertwingled; just the way I like it. (See The Death and Life of Great American Cities for more reasons.)
 
The apartments  all the apartments  are rent controlled, one of the socialist remnants in Swedens social democracy. In practice, this leads to some odd results. No one ever gives up an apartment, so tenants feel safe installing nameplates on their doors. Instead of giving up the place, they give it to their family, their friends, or let their children inherit it. Once you have an apartment contract, you can swap it with anyone elses (and there are web sites to help you do this), but to get one you need to add your name to a list when you turn 18, and then wait for ten to twenty years for an apartment to open up. Those with money but not that kind of time instead pay under the table for a contract.
 
There are no homeless people in Stockholm, but one person I spoke to claimed that this was because the homeless didnt know anyone with a rent contract, so they all stayed in the suburbs, which they were more familiar with anyway, and as a result there ended up being about as many homeless per capita as in a the average American city.
 
Backlash politics is incredibly popular in the US, where theres not that much to backlash against, but its even more popular in Sweden, where theres some justification. US-style libertarians are everywhere, this time with some actual justification for their persecution complexes. Although not much. A new conservative government has recently taken power and has pulled all the libertarians out to fill up the political positions.
 
Our roommate just happened to hang out with libertarians in college; now all her friends are top officials in the government. A smaller country, it starts to seem like everyone knows everybody here (I suppose they all went to college together).
 
Of course, there are still outsiders. The country has private email mailing lists on which all the gossip about how the county is actually run (and who the royalty is actually screwing) is shared among the prominent journalists and other figures. (There are similar secret lists in other fields, including one for the left-wing of the US Democratic Party.) Journalists know that sharing that kind of information with the public simply isnt done and those who violate the rules are unceremoniously kicked off. Occasionally a young reporter uses their column to complain theyre not on the list, but the people in the know just laugh at them.
 
Its the same kind of laugh you imagine Swedens IKEA founders having as you marvel at their clever tax-dodging schemes. IKEA, the famed Swedish interior design chain now sweeping the US, is owned by a company called Ingka Holding, which is actually owned by a tax-exempt not-for-profit  the worlds largest, even larger than the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Not that selling interior furnishings is at all comparable to curing Malaria.) The not-for-profit channels its funds to a Dutch foundation which is operated by a Swiss lawyer friend but shares some of its assets with another Dutch company which is owned by a Luxembourg holding company which is owned by a company in the Netherlands which is run by a trust in the Carribean. You can probably guess where the tax-free money goes from there.
 
IKEA is everywhere in Sweden. Their couches fill the tiny rent-controlled apartments, their chairs are found in everyones offices, and when you finish your drink the light shining through the bottom of the glass illuminates the word: IKEA.

Interesting piece as usual, although saying that there are no homeless people in Stockholm is a bit weird depending on your definition of suburbs. I see at least two or three of them each week, by just passing through the city by commuter train and metro as part of my daily commute. Maybe youve even heard of the magazine Situation Stockholm, sold by rehabilitating drug addicts (its not a 1:1 relationship between drug addicts and homeless but theres a lot of overlap).
 
Itll be fun to hear further reflections about what Swedens like. Living as I do (as we all do to a point these days) online and being so calibrated to the US viewpoint its fun to get someone elses perspective on your own country for once.

I agree with Jesper - there are homeless people in Stockholm, although I expect that most of them sleep in shelters, caravans, storage rooms and the like, rather than out in the streets. They can usually be found outside the underground stations or in the parks.
 
In central Stockholm I agree about apartments and other areas being intermingled, but thats mostly in the areas that were built before the 1950s. Theres no shortage of project housing (constructed during the miljonprogram years) 20-30 minutes away from the city centre, built with the ideal of separating living, work and shopping.
 
I also think youre overstating how the housing market works. Its a mixture between regulations and a free market - if you have money you can buy an apartment straight away.
 
You only have to wait in the apartment queue if you 1) dont want to or cant afford to purchase an apartment, or 2) want a cheap apartment in central Stockholm. You can get a nice apartment in a reasonable location after 12 months, and there are apartments you can get straight away. (For instance: a 2-room 59m2 apartment in Skarpnck, 5000SEK(~720USD)/month is available right now.)
 
Im not saying that the apartment market is perfect, only that it isnt as bad as some people claim, and not as regulated either. The nameplate thing is probably cultural - after all it only takes 5 minutes to put it up or remove it.
 
Getting your perspective on Stockholm and Sweden is interesting, although you should be aware that its a bit like someone visiting central SF and drawing conclusions about politics, housing, etc - not necessarily wrong, but not necessarily the whole picture either.

and then we get those neutrality autonomous super-national law and super-international zone, tax haven spots all over the world, and practices to use them.
 
and we still believe we understand how we live, and have scientific discipine called

Sweden is not socialist, nor is any other country in Western Europe. Read up on Socialism on Wikipedia. Socialism is basically a dictatorship under an equalitarian guise and not much different from communism. Sweden and other European countries basically have a free market economy with some exceptions thrown in to mitigate the worst effects of free markets. Calling European countries socialist is unfortunately also typical of Americans that harbor fears of anything left of the Democrats.

The housing market is indeed rather dysfunctional in that a flat in central Stockholm can be cheaper than one in the outer suburbs (by law!) but there are lots of condominium-type apartments that are wholly priced by the market. Thus expensive.
 
Also socialism is pushing it when describing Sweden, but the views on equality etc. differ so much from mainstream American views that the difference is felt to be larger than it actually is. For example, in Sweden you can lose an election for promising to lower taxes.
 
In cultural matters (music, movies, food) the American influence is greater than, in my opinion, the European. No-one can read French or German, but most can get by in English.

I dont believe there are many libertarians in Sweden in the US sense. Oh, there are some pro-drugs people, but pro-gun, taxation-is-theft, Ayn-Rand-is-God people are practically non-existent here in Norway (cant see why Sweden should be different). Bloggers are another case, because they/we read so much US news that we tend to think in US terms and political categories. But they are a vanishingly small minority. I doubt youd find one scandinavian in 300 who has heard about Ayn Rand.
 
Homeless people in Oslo are offered places to move in to. Some still refuse, for various reasons. Perhaps its too far to get drugs, perhaps its because it doesnt make much difference to them - often they are so unable to take care of themselves that they cant keep an apartement habitable.
 
Most American cities are still suffering from the urban planning designed to keep non-existent factory fumes away from peoples homes. You are born after the clean air act in the US, which mandated scrubbing out the worst of the soot, arent you?

Maybe there ar few homeless people in Sweden but I have never come across a more odd nation. People dont talk to each other. they dont get married. 60% of the people in Stockholm remain single. A perfect vacation for a Swede is to sit all alone in a deep forest knowing nobody is neraer than 16 miles away. I have been to most countries all over the world. Scandinavians are the oddest particularly the swedes. I was happy when I reached the German border again and will never set foot on any Scandi nations again

Title: Happy New Year
 
Nobody seems to have noticed, but over the past couple months, this blog has been publishing a record post a day. Every weekday  plus, starting a little later, a bonus post on sundays  Ive written an entirely new essay. Ive done this while traveling, while celebrating holidays, while galavanting around the world, while sleeping on the couches of published authors. Ive even written and posted whole pieces using the SSH feature on my cell phone.
 
I dont know anyone else who has done this. There are columnists who write for the paper, but they only have to post a couple times a week. And there are bloggers who post many times a day, but they mostly post links and commentary, not whole essays. As far as I know, Im alone in this bizarre pursuit.
 
It was a fun experiment but it was also a lot of work. I still have lots to say, but Im not sure that forcing myself to say it every day is quite so healthy. I want to work on writing better, not just faster. I wrote most of the blog posts in about an hour and while theyre decent for something written at that rate, they can rarely be called great.
 
So I think its time to slow down, work more on crafting my prose, maybe write for magazines and other outlets. (If someone out there wants to publish me, drop me a line!) This will probably hurt my readership, but running this blog has always been a weird and random occupation, done more for me than for page views.
 
So I guess thats goodbye for now and thanks for stopping by. If this piece gets posted when its supposed to, its New Years Day and Ive still got a couple more weeks of winter break to spend world-travelling. So expect some silence until I get back. Au revoir!

Could have been named Jerry Roll or something[This blog].
 
If you wanted to experiment with some raw thought thing with people - that could have been done too. But you seemignly chose to stick with very classic (and say muscline?) way of deciding whats writing is.
 
So that kind of comes across. You are talking of some quite defenseless or exposing stuff - well thats not bad thing, esp if you havent go through school days with many or even some close, reliable friends, talking over one subject  over years.

Title: The Sociologists Creed
 
Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.

Title: Products That Should Exist
 
A free Gmail clone. A lot of people I know use Gmail for email. Its not because they dont have access to servers or cant afford a couple gigabytes of disk space. Its because Gmail is simply the best interface for email out there right now. Itd be even better if it was free software, though.
 
The biggest problem with Gmail is that you cant run it offline. But if it was free software, you could run it on your local machine and use it even when not connected to the net. This would also have the nice benefit of making it much faster for the user. Some synchronization code would be necessary, but itd be worth it.
 
Gmail isnt all that complicated; this really shouldnt be that hard.
 
A nice OS X Tor interface. Ive talked to a bunch of people who would like to use Tor, but find it just too complicated. Ideally, the interface should be very simple. You download the Tor binary and double-click it to start using Tor and quit out to stop. And so that you know its working, itll have a little window that will show you the names of servers youre connected to.
 
OS X has APIs for changing the system preferences; just use those to set the SOCKS server properly. Tor has APIs for finding out when you connect to a server, use those to set the display. For a decent Mac programmer, this cant be more than a days worth of work, but itd make Tor vastly more usable.
 
Decent backup software. Ive already written about this. It still hasnt happened.
 
If anyones interested in building any of these, let me know and perhaps we can work something out.

An important part of Gmail is the server farm on which its running. Thunderbird, the default free software mail client, coupled with an IMAP server, provides most of the features the people like in Gmail (though admittedly not the user interface). Still, on my powerful desktop machine its barely usable, with the amounts of mail Im dealing with, and I had to make a pragmatic choice to forward everything to Gmail. Most of the things folks like about Gmail are not easy to reproduce as client software - its stuff like the excellent (collective) spam filtering, the reliability of the service, the integration with Googles other web services. The user interface is just a nice added bonus. Still it really is a shame that Gmail is not free software, and making a free clone might convince Google to release their code (in the same way the projects like Harmony convinced Sun to release the Java sources code).

Backup software should be invisible. You should never have to think about it - it should just work. Time Machine in Leopard may be what youre looking for. Leopard also has ZFS, which maintains snapshots and can revert to previous versions.
 
Right now I use Deja Vu, which runs in the background and automatically backs up my home folder to my Linux server every night.

For the last goddamn time, Leopard does not have any ZFS support. It is not there in the latest developer seeds. The disk utility screenshots are either fake or internal. I talked to Apples Developer Relations crew, and they said that the entirety of the ZFS rumor comes from one guy who works at Apple that posted to the ZFS mailing list to see if people might be interested.
 
There is nobody at Apple working on it for 10.5.0. Time Machine has nothing to do with ZFS  it uses a new HFS+ feature for hard linking to directories, thats it.
 
Seamless backup will likely never be a solved problem. ZFS goes a long way towards getting us there, but it is not magic. Dont treat it as such.

The gmail UI is good, but you could think of so many better UI solutions for an email client.

Its not as a reliable as you would expect from a rich company like Google. Its much more reliable than what I can afford to maintain (and Im a relatively advanced user - most users can afford much less than that).
 
and doesnt integrate well at all with the other services
 
It integrates much better than any other option. Jabber is built in and you can search your chat history using the same interface. You can open attachments using Writely. You get notifications directly to your personal portal, including to the mobile phone version. I think theres more.
 
My point is, the reason people use Gmail is not because they are unable to run the same software locally. If your proposed compatible clone will be able to back to Gmail by default Id probably use it, though - it would be nice to run my own client and be able to extend it, but still use Gmail when I dont have access to my customized version.

My backup isnt fully automated, but thats fine for me because I have to plug in the disks anyways. But it is incremental, quickly restorable, and keeps all Mac metadata (supposedly; it keeps all the  metadata Ive found or been able to conjure up).
 
What I do is this: I use SuperDuper to clone my laptops drive to a NAS, which also contains a bunch of files that arent on the internal drive. Then, I use rdiff-backup to incrementally backup the NAS to a USB disk.
 
The advantages of doing this instead of just rdiff-backuping my internal drive are that rdiff-backup misses a lot of Mac metadata, first, and second, it becomes ludicrously slow for lots of small files. rdiff-backup is much happier finding diffs in a huge disk image file than it is comparing thousands of one-block files. Furthermore, I have a disk image that I can easily restore and boot from using ASR.

Title: Causes of Conformance
 
Institutions require people to do their bidding. A tobacco company must find people willing to get kids addicted to cigarettes, a school must find teachers willing to repeat the same things that they were taught, a government must find public servants willing to enforce the law.
 
Part of this is simply necessity. To survive, people need money; to get money, people need a job; to get a job, people need to find an existing institution. But the people in these positions dont usually see themselves as mercenaries, doing the smallest amount to avoid getting fired while retaining their own value system. Instead, they adopt the value system of the institution, pushing it even when its not necessary for their own survival. What explains this pattern of conformance?
 
The most common explanation is an active process of beating people in: politicians get paid campaign contributions (legalized bribes) to meet the needs of the wealthy, employees get bonuses and penalties for meeting the needs of their employers, kids get threatened with time-outs and bad grades if they dont follow the demands of their teachers. In each case, the people are forced through a series of carrots and sticks to learn the values of the people in charge.
 
This is a fairly blatant form of conformance, but I suspect its by far the least effective. Studies on punishment and rewards show that dealing them out lessens the victims identification with the enforcer. Hitting me every time I dont do my job right may teach me how to do my job, but its not going to make me particularly excited about it.
 
Indeed, punishments and rewards interfere with a much more significant effect: cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance studies have found that simply by getting you to do something, you can be persuaded to agree with it. In a classic study, students asked to write an essay in favor of a certain position were found to agree more with the position than students who could write for either position. Similarly, people who pay more to eat a certain food claim to like it more than people who pay less.
 
The basic theory is that people work to lessen the disagreement between their beliefs and their actions and in most cases its simply easier to change your beliefs. Quitting your job for the government is tough and painful; and who knows if youll soon find another? So its much easier to simply persuade yourself that you agree with the government, that youre doing the right and noble thing, that your work to earn a paycheck is really a service to mankind.
 
Of course, it also helps that everyone youre surrounded by feels the same way. Culture is another important influence on our beliefs. Another raft of social psychology studies find that people are willing to deny even obvious truths to fit in with a group. In the famous Asch studies on conformance, a group of confederates were seated around a table, with the subject of the experiment on the end. Everyone at the table was given a sheet with three lines, one obviously longer than the other, and then was asked to name the two lines of identical length. All of the confederates gave an obviously wrong answer and by the time the question got to the guy at the end, he ended up conforming and giving the wrong answer as well.
 
Similarly, spend your days in government offices where people simply take it for granted that theyre doing the right thing, and youre likely to pick up that tacit assumption yourself. Such ideas are not only frequently stated, theyre often the very foundation of the discussion. And foundational ideas are particularly hard to question, particularly because theyre so taken for granted.
 
But perhaps the most important effect for conformance is simply selection. Imagine that nobody was corruptible, that all the carrots and sticks in the world couldnt get someone to do something they thought morally wrong, that they stood fast in the face of cognitive dissonance, and that their moral fiber was so strong that they were able to resist a less conscientious culture. Even then, it wouldnt make much difference. As long as there was enough variety in people and their moral values, all an organization would need to do is simply fire (or fail to promote) everyone who didnt play their game.
 
Everyone knows you climb the corporate ladder by being a team player. Those who make a fuss or dont quite live up to expectations simply get passed over for a promotion. The result is simply that  without any explicit pressure at all  the people in positions of power happen to be the ones who identify with the organizations aims.
 
Its easy to look at the rather more flashy pieces of punishing people for failing to follow orders or living in a culture of conformity. But for those who want obedient employees, sometimes the most effective technique is simply failing to say yes.

Institutions take on a life of their own, then, eh? If the CEO of Exxon/Mobil were to object to his job on moral grounds, he would quickly be replaced with someone who doesnt.

But its not a black/white situation, as we see in practice - replace killing with maximizing profits, possibly affecting and your mother with third-world poor people that look different, and or I will with or your competitor will, wholl then get that $3 million bonus instead of you - and youll see a lot of intelligent people changing their minds.
 
If you also consider the systems in place that entice corporate executives by the methods you mentioned (approval of their golfing buddies, fancy stockholder meetings, etc.), then their actions become at least understandable, if not morally justified.
 
Morality is hard to talk about, though, since free will is probably an illusion.

If I read you correctly, Id like to point out that cognitive dissonance is not a disagreement between beliefs and actions, but disagreement between sets of cognitions. These cognitions can be beliefs or they can be perceptions of ones actions.
 
One example that always reminds me of the power of it is the group that Leon Festinger infltrated in the 1950s led by Marion Keech ( see also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Festinger )
 
There, the set of cognitions (that a spaceship sent from God would come to take them away from the evil world and that the collective actions of the group were correct) conflicted with the reality of the situation (no spaceship came). They had to construct new cognition that would rest the dissonance without destroying their old cognitions (that God respected their actions so much, they spared the whole planet).

Title: Wither the Two Cultures?
 
Nearly fifty years ago C. P. Snow delivered his famous Two Cultures lecture, deploring the state of affairs in which the humanities, especially those who believed in constructionism, had intellectually diverged from the sciences. Scientists didnt care about Shakespeare; while literists bragged about not knowing any math.
 
But pick up a modern popular novel and its hard to see this criticism holding much weight. All the literary outlets have been touting Thomas Pynchons new tome, Against the Day. Pynchons novels, as eminent literist Scott McLemee put it, discuss the domains of information theory, mathematical physics, cosmology with frequent references to such subjects as William Hamiltons quaternions or Georg Riemanns zeta function in which the Michelson-Morley experiment takes center stage.
 
Its hard to imagine anything but a new Richard Feynman book could do more to warm a scientists heart.
 
Meanwhile, take Jonathan Franzens bestseller, The Corrections (even an Oprahs book club pick!). The book, which revolves around the dot-com economic upturn, not only features frequent and detailed references to eigenvector-based computer algorithms, advances in neurological technology, and odd properties of electrophoresis, but even features a main character who goes from being in that most constructivist of professions  left-wing literary criticism  to a job building dot-com websites.
 
It seems geekiness has gone mainstream. And along with it, the geeky culture of scientism now buts up against the aesthete culture of literism. Its hard to see how anyone can take the two cultures complaints seriously anymore.

This was probably bound to happen at sometime. Many recent bestsellers pride themselves on intense research and knowledge of the particular domain. You find jargon, technical words, and theories thrown all over the place. The reader is suitably impressed.
 
A word of caution using another example: I (and many other TV watchers) see medical shows (like Grays Anatomy) where we cannot half understand the terminology (medical terms) used. But the context of what is happening and the emotional tone keeps me engrossed. Could that be what is happening with these kind of books?

A better test than a couple of carefully chosen works of fiction is universities. I happened to be one of the few people who has always been interested in both cultures, and took courses in university from both sides of the divide, and I can assure you that the humanities professors (and students) are for the most part completely ignorant of the sciences and mathematics  and do indeed wear their ignorance as a badge of pride  and the professors and students in the sciences are for the most part equally ignorant of the humanities, literature, etc.
 
There are always some exceptions, of course. I had a few science professors who were polymaths of sorts, and I had one polymath humanities professor who was scientifically literate and interest, but these were exceptions that emphasized the continuing relevance of Snows critique.
 
Id submit that universities  professors and their students  are far better places to look for evidence than works of fiction. Even in Snows day, there were works of fiction and people who spanned both sides of the divide (e.g., Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll), but Snow looked among his colleagues at Cambridge and saw that the great divide was for the most part the rule rather than the exception.

That people and their institutions are not automatons is true, only if you do not pan out far enough to where the important statical correlations obtain.  Take for example,  Mr President, to surge or not to surge.  As an automaton, you will surge  you will secure and hold Baghdad*  it is the only way forward consistent with your prior rhetoric of victory and the industrial imperative to finish constructing your enemy    you must do it!  That is the command of the script.  Sorry, the script  does not sanction the occasional courageous break from the weighty baggage of a long career.  Sorry, such a rare and unexpected event, however dramatic, however life saving, however just  does not appear anywhere in the script.

Title: Cultural Imperialism Sucks: a visit to Berlin
 
After I exited the plane, it took me several minutes before I realized I
was in Germany. After all, the airport was designed with the same basic
concepts, the people all looked fairly normal, and all the
advertisements were all identical to their counterparts in the US.
 
Once we left the airport and begun wandering around Berlin, things
didnt get much better. There was a Dunkin Donuts and a Burger King, a
Pizza Hut and a T-Mobile store (called T-Punkt in some weird homage to
Ashton Kutcher), ads for Coca-Cola and even a The Body Shop. (A major
shopping mall was run by Sony; just like in old SF.) The streets looked
roughly similar, the cars had the same manufacturers, the buildings had
the same basic styles.
 
The similarity plays tricks on you. It not only took me a while to
realize I was in Germany, it was a while before I realized this was the
former home of the Nazis. (I was trying to think where Id heard of the
Reichstag before) When I exclaimed my discovery, apparently the older
people on the bus turned to look at me. One wonders how much of their
fitting in is an attempt to forget their different past.
 
There were still differences, of course. In America, if someone knocked
you out and took you on a plane to some random city in the country, you
probably wouldnt notice except for the fact that the street signs might
have changed color. Aside from that tiny bit of individuality, cities in
America are almost literally indistinguishable, down to the streets and
landscaping. Germany isnt that bad.
 
The most obvious is that they get to keep speaking their quirky little
language, although only speaking English here gets you pretty far. On
the other hand, their currencyand presumably their governmenthas
been integrated into the EU. But the biggest thing you notice is that
the city is simply more elegant. The cars are smaller, the public
transit far superior, and the font on the street signs to die for. But
if london had EU currency, Im not sure itd be all that
distinguishable.
 
There is a blatant taste for modernist architecture. (This is the land
of the Bauhaus, I suppose.) Just about every building Ive been to has
been done up in styles that would be considered high culture in America.
Including our hotel room, where you can see into the top half of the
shower from the bed and a door swings between the shower and the toilet,
so that you can only use one with any privacy at once.
 
Despite the usual guidebook platitudes, Berlin does not feel like a
particularly vibrant city. Abandoned construction sites are everywhere,
with large quantities of supplies just laying by the street, and
graffiti coats most public surfaces, not enough to demand a repainting,
but enough to make it everpresent. All the stores have signs announcing
that new, shorter hours will begin starting next year. I overhear
complaints about 18% unemployment.
 
With an overseas like this, one wonders why Americans make such a fuss
about going overseas. One can apparently visit Europe with about as much
culture shock as visiting LA: a few different local chains, a different
public transit system, a new accent to learn, and, of course, a new set
of street signs. A convenience for the business traveler, perhaps. A
vast emptiness for everyone else.

Well, there are lots of other cities in europe where you can really feel differences. I would say that some main cities are very similar to each other, but just go to smaller places.
 
Although imperialism is imperialism.
 
If you ever come to Madrid Ill be glad to show you the city.

Hey, Im with ya, but having a T-Mobile store in Berlin is NOT US cultural imperialism  T-Mobile is Deutsche Telekom.
 
This highlights an interesting aspect of the imperialism  its not necessarily US imperialism. Rather, its fast becoming multinational corporate imperialism, through which the US is just as colonized by German brands as Germany is colonized by US brands (or Japanese brands, like Sony; or Finnish brands, like Nokia, etc).
 
Its actually a measure of how successful these multinationals are that an American feels like T-Mobile is an American company thats slightly out-of-place in Berlin. They manage to make your local franchise ghetto feel genuinely local, even if all the logos on display represent nominally foreign companies.

With an overseas like this, one wonders why Americans make such a fuss about going overseas. 
 
Aaron, Europe is not the only overseas out there.  Europe and the United States share a lot of commonalities as most of us Americans are descendants from European immigrants.  Even disregarding the American cultural imperialism you see going back to Europe, youre going to see some of Europe in America, although really watered down.  Try going to a radically different place.  Kragen and I have been traveling in Latin America and its very different here.  Yes, there are American influences here as well, but the countries here are on such different levels of economic strength that it boggles the mind and opens the eyes.  We have found that large cities are similar, but you can find the unique difference if you pay attention.
 
I would like to suggest that you stop being so negative in your posts.  Life is not that bad, really.  Look for the joys and simple pleasures and you will find them.  Life is much more enjoyable that way.

The Reichstag was the seat of government for many years before the Nazis came around.  It burned in 1933 when the Nazis took power, and was more or less unusable until 1964.  So Im not sure its accurate to call it the former home of the Nazis.
 
I suppose if I overheard European tourists on a bus in the US gabbing about ugly episodes in American history, Id turn and look too  it seems kinder to talk about the touchier points of your hosts history more privately.

Hey Aaron,
 
One thing Ive noticed in what little travel Ive done is how inaccurate a first glance can be - especially without a person on the inside as (for lack of a better expression) a guide.
 
American cities are deceptively similar but after staying a while and talking to people I realize just how different a locality can be from another.
 
Id assume even more so with Berlin - a little patience and a little conversation might reveal all kinds of wonders that make you exclaim at how different it is.

Im amazed at some of the things youve said here and your apparent attitude to travel. Perhaps youve come across as more cynical and impolite than you are IRL, but I cant help feeling that this is verging on a caricature of how we Europeans see American tourists.

Do you really think that if a German visited New York and noted how many Vietnamese the Americans killed s/he would get a better reception than you did on mentioning the Nazis? And I cant really believe that you dont understand how EU integration works, surely even the most moronic guide book would cover these basic issues.

I am sorry to see that you are a soul not sensitive enough to feel the particularities of this fantastic city of millions. As we all know, cultural globalization, and its according cultural homogenization, usually only lies at the surface of things. Did you really get down to talking to some young people? did you visit the art shops, the squat houses, the various cultural scenes? Did you learn about life in Berlin? Of course, as a tourist you may not be able to get to the core of a place I such a short time span. But you gotta open up your mind, and make contact with people. You are allowed to dislike Berlin, that is your very right to have your own taste. But do not do so under the heading its all the same, because then you are writing more about yourself than about the city. Perhaps you yourself are culturally numbed, no longer able to absorb a places particularities and nature? Maybe, from the very start in the airport, you were wearing the wrong glasses? If you are weary of cultural homogenization or so-called Americanization, at least make the effort to be an original, individual human being, with his own capabilities to discover a place.

Aaron  As some commenters have already noted, this is an unfortunate first impression many Americans seem to have when they travel overseas.

Okay, this is like banging my head up against a wall; Im not quite sure why I continue to read your blog when it just frustrates me.
 
But as an American who lived in Germany, I have to bluntly note that YOU are coming across as the (rightfully hated) Ugly American.  And  once again  Im perhaps wrongly surprised.  Youre a smart guy.  But your entry here suggests a cluelessness, a callousness, and (again) an emptiness that is depressing and regrettable.
 
Why so superficial?  Why cant you look deeper, Aaron?  I would ask if you talked to any people but a better question would be: did you LISTEN?  I mean, really listen?  Do you ever?  Or do you simply find it less troublesome to assume, to block out, to put a fortress around your mind and soul?
 
Berlin, like any city, is unique and  in many ways  truly compelling.  Its more than its outward appearance, more than the most infamous aspects of its history.
 
Im not saying you have to like it.  Many of my German friends  even a couple who LIVE in Berlin  hate the city.  But to simply blow it off, to remark on superficial similarities and not to exhibit a sense of wonder, of curiosity thats bleak and ridiculous.
 
Im guessing you dont really care dont care what others think, dont really care that YOU are not deeply thinking.  Its easier just to blather out words on a page or a screen.  And I should stop caring.
 
But when I see someone who has the mental (if not emotional) capacity to understand, to appreciate it makes me sad when that potential is not realized.
 
Make some friends.  Smile.  Appreciate.  Even if you decide to hate humanity, at least open your heart to individuals and individual moments.

I can only echo some of the other comments. Ive often heard that American cities are all alike, but it strikes me as an affectation that stresses the superficial. Im currently in suburban Detroit, and cant begin to count the ways its different from suburban Boston, even though they both have many of the same stores. Is L.A. anything like San Francisco? Is San Antonio much like Houston, for that matter? Id similarly caution you not to make generalizations about Europe based on Berlin, since you appear to have had only a glancing experience with the latter.
 
As for the modernist architecture, its also apparent here and there in London, but its clear the Luftwaffe was as much to blame for that calamity as postwar architects. So I wouldnt call it a taste as a matter of expediency. Try comparing cities that were leveled with comparable cities that werent: instead of Berlin, try Prague or Copenhagen. You can even compare it with Munich, where postwar planners tried their best to mimic the citys earlier look.
 
Regarding your encounter on the bus, Aaron, I doubt the odd looks you received had much at all to do with Germans trying to forget their Nazi past. And neither is it simply a matter of etiquette. I try to imagine myself on a New York subway encountering a tourist who was not only unaware of some of the most basic aspects of my citys history, but willing to announce it as some sort of revelation to all the other passengers. Wow, so all these theaters around Times Square, they staged musicals at one point? or Wall Street  world financial capital  never made the connection. I would judge this person a complete ignoramus and wonder what on earth brought him here. (Id also kick his ass and rob him, but thats besides the point.)

Your comments about Berlin are totally irrelevant. And let me tell you that you dont give a positive image of the American open-mindedness, and in addition you totally fit to the image that we Europeans have about Americans, i.e total ignorants. Im back from this city just yesterday, and this was my second trip there. This place is just great for someone who has a little interest for culture and/or intelligence. Before making such a description of a city you dont know, youd better get some more information about it. It basically seems that you visited only Tegel airport and Potsdamer Platz, which is not a real broad view of such a big town that Berlin is, is it? Ive been there during the World Cup and for Xmas and New Years Eve and let me tell you that the Berliners rock. Theyve got warm hearts. And as far as the culture and architecture, youve not been to far, have you? Have you seen the Wall Memorial? The Holocaust Memorial? Have you seen Hackescher Markt?  Have you seen any of the thousand parks this city has? Any Berliner would just call you names if one comes to see your post - which is the case by now, btw.  This city is in perpetual movement and evolution, which you dont seem to have grasped so farif youd like to find Imperialism, be it cultural, military, or economic, have a look at your side of the Atlantic.

I cannot help but suspect that its not so much the lack of being different than perhaps a somewhat underdeveloped perception and appreciation of differences that might be the issue here. Granted, in a Western metropolis, an American traveler will not be able to ooh-ahh at odd ways of writing, weird dress or modes of transportation, or any other signs of non-Western living that MacTourists seem to expect to find on their travels. But vast emptiness?
 
Berlin is not only the former capital of Nazi Germany [*], and as such full of historical sites from those days, it is also (at least in part) the capital of a former COMECON country, and the place where the cold war not so long ended, live and in color, in front of the world and its cameras, and it is not difficult to find all sorts of left-overs from those times, either. Berlin is, in many ways, one of the focal points of modern history, and there arent too many of those around. Running around a place like that and complaining about the Dunkin Donuts and T-Mobile shops (which, of course, originated in Germany, so at least for them it should not come as a surprise to find them there), and the vast emptiness they presumably signal, seems weirdly incongruous.
 
Maybe its the same effect that you run into when learning a different language-until you have trained your ear to perceive the different sounds, you wont be able to hear them, much less speak them. Until you have educated your cultural perception to see the differences, all you see is that the Dunkin Donuts is the same as where you come from.
 
The real cultural imperialism is not the fact that Dunkin Donus opens shops in Europe, or that the Telekom opens shops in the U.S. Todays cultural imperialism is exemplified by people who travel around the globe only to assess the culture of a place by the brands on the store fronts outside the hotel and airport, and from their tour bus.

Aaron, as someone who has spent a significant amount of time in Berlin, it appears that that you went to Times Square and missed the East Village, Harlem, Chinatown, Lower East Side, Brooklyn, and everything in between. Clearly one can only see limited parts of a city in a limited amount of time (and my impression is that you wrote this post after only having spent one day there), but to merely go to Times Square and purport to make judgments about New York City as a whole is just wrong.
 
Berlin is one of the most vibrant cities that I have ever been to, and Ive traveled quite a bit. The cultural vibrancy of Berlin is truly striking,  due largely to the cheap rents in the East after German reunification and the artsy, Bohemian crowd that quickly flocked there as a result. During the late 90s, Berlin was like one big construction site. Cranes were everywhere, and everything was under transition. While the cranes are now for the most part gone, Berlin has not lost its quality as a city that moves extremely rapidly, sometimes even too much so. For example, when I traveled there from one year to the next, entire areas of the city had completely changed in appearance, many new spaces had opened up and others closed, and some of my favorite places were gone.
 
One of the things that always struck me about Berlin, though, was how easy it was to completely miss the real Berlin, to visit the city yet not permeate its seemingly rough exterior. Luckily, my experience was somewhat different, due in large part to my penchant for delving deeply into cities, the length of time I spent there (almost a year in total), my German language abilities, and my love for going out and meeting new people. I lived in the East, and barely, if ever made it to the West (with the one major exception of Kreuzberg, particularly the area known as Little Istanbul around Kotbusser Tor and the famed punk area called SO 36.) One of the great qualities about many parts of the former East, though, is the lack of commercializationsomething that you obviously did not perceive, probably because you did not venture there. While admittedly, things have gotten more commercialized/globalized within the last 10 or so years, including such things as a mall in Prenzlauer Berg and the opening of the Sony Center at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin is still very low on the scale of Cultural Imperialism in my mind.
 
My guess is that you did not make it to many of the places that I did, and while I know you didnt have nearly as much time, its really a shame. Maybe instead of basing your impressions on the Dunkin Donuts and the (yes, German) T-Mobile stores in the touristy areas of the city, you could have explored its vibrant art scene,  its notorious underground music scene, its serene parks, its warehouse-rich post-industrial areas, or its kietz-oriented squares. If you had, you would have seen a completely different city, what I consider the real Berlin.
 
If you do ever decide to go back, please do talk to me first.

One thing that was left out by all the other (justified) critics who posted comments: the areas which Aaron describes are in the most commercial and touristed part of the city, i.e. Tiergarten and the Mitte, which comprise some 45 out of the 891 sq. km which the city of Berlin covers.  Can you really evaluate a city after seeing less than 1/20th of it?

Title: The Journalists Creed
 
I am not sure what more I could tell you about these pieces. I could tell you that I liked doing some of them more than others, but that all of them were hard for me to do, and took more time than perhaps they were worth; that there is always a point in the writing of a piece when I sit in a room literally papered with false starts and cannot put one word after another and imagine that I have suffered a small stroke, leaving me apparently undamaged but actually aphasic. I was in fact as sick as I had ever been when I was writing Slouching Towards Bethlehem; the pain kept me awake at night and so for twenty and twenty-one hours a day I drank gin-and-hot-water to blunt the pain and took Dexedrine to blunt the gin and wrote the piece. (I would like you to believe that I kept working out of some real professionalism, to meet the deadline, but that would not be entirely true; I did have a deadline, but it was also a troubled time, and working did to the trouble what gin did to the pain.) What else is there to tell? I am bad at interviewing people. I avoid situations in which I have to talk to anyones press agent. (This precludes doing pieces on most actors, a bonus in itself.) I do not like to make telephone calls, and would not like to count the mornings I have sat on some Best Western motel bed somewhere and tried to force myself to put through the call to the assistant district attorney. My only advantage as a reporter is that I am so physically small, so temperamentally unobtrusive, and so neurotically inarticulate that people tend to forget that my presence runs counter to their best interests. And it always does. That is one last thing to remember: writers are always selling somebody out.
 
(Joan Didion, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, xv-xvi)
 
In fact I have abandoned altogether that kind of pointless entry; instead I tell what some would call lies. Thats simply not true, the members of my family frequently tell me when they come up against my memory of a shared event. The party was not for you, the spider was not a black widow, it wasnt that way at all. Very likely they are right, for not only have I always had trouble distinguishing between what happened and what merely might have happened, but I remain unconvinced that the distinction, for my purposes, matters. The cracked crab that I recall having for lunch the day my father came home from Detroit in 1945 must certainly be embroidery, worked into the days pattern to lend verisimilitude; I was ten years old and would not now remember the cracked crab. The days events did not turn on cracked crab. And yet it is precisely that fictitious crab that makes me see the afternoon all over again, a home movie run all too often, the father bearing gifts, the child weeping, an exercise in family love and guilt. Or that is what it was to me. Similarly, perhaps it never did snow that August in Vermont; perhaps there never were flurries in the night wind and maybe no one else felt the ground hardening and summer already dead even as we pretended to bask in it, but that was how it felt to me, and it might as well have snowed, could have snowed, did snow.

And it surely it did snow. I like to think that the world is what we make of it. That might be a bit daft, and it definitely even makes others come up with extreme perspectives. Such as the world being made of mint jelly. History goes hand-in-hand with the world. The kings, dates, battles of today and yesterday, yeah. They happened, but only to those who are sure it did (or not so sure).

Title: Sociology or Anthropology
 
Sometimes people ask me what the difference is between sociology and anthropology. There are the surface ones, of course  sociology typically studies first-world societies, whereas anthropology has a rep for studying so-called primitive cultures. But the fundamental difference is a philosophical one: sociologists study society, while anthropologists study culture.
 
Whats the difference? Lets do a case study. Its easy to notice a subtle sort of sexism in American textbooks. For example, studies have found that in biology textbooks sperm are seen as competitive creatures while eggs are passive receptacles they aim to penetrate. But the actual science on the subject is much less clear: eggs seem to do a fair bit of selection themselves, etc.
 
I saw a paper by an anthropologist on this fact; their argument was that these textbooks were a result of the sexism of American culture, a culture which sees men as competing for access to women, and those notions are naturally transported onto our writing about conception. Sexist culture, sexist output.
 
A sociologist would dig a little deeper. Theyd see who writes the textbooks, perhaps notice a disproportionate number of males. Theyd look into why it was that males got these jobs, find the sexism inherent in the relevant institutions. Theyd argue it was the structures of society that end up with sexist textbooks, not some magical force known as American culture.
 
As you might guess, Im on the side of the sociologists. Blaming things on culture  as if it were a natural property of a group of people or a mystical life force with its own mind  seems too facile. It also seems wrong.
 
Ive mostly been talking about the cultural anthropologists, but there are also a subset of racist anthropologists (sometimes called anthropological science, in accordance with Walls Law). These anthropologists tried to measure different properties of people, see if they could quantify the differences between the races and predict criminality from the shape of the head.
 
Cultural anthropologists disdain all that and prefer to endorse a very left-wing notion of cultural relativism. (One shouldnt make judgments about other cultures!) But in doing so, they end up pushing the judgments off onto the peoples involved. Just like the racist anthropologists, they end up suggesting that the reason people over here believe act differently from the people over there is because theyre different people.
 
But if theres one thing weve learned from psychology, its that  for the most part  people are people, wherever you go. As Zimbardos Stanford Prison Experiment showed, put normal people into the wrong situation and they turn into devious enforcement machines. And put the same people into a different society and theyll change just as fast.
 
It isnt culture  whatever that is  that causes these things; its institutions. Institutions create environments which force a course of action. And thats why Im a sociologist.
 
Bonus recommendation: Ive been watching The Wire lately; perhaps the most sociologically-inclined show on television. And thats what makes it interesting, unlike all the other good-evil cop dramas.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.
 
December 23, 2006
 
The interesting thing to me in Zimbardos study (and even more so in Milgrams earlier shock experiments) is that the subjects were carefully selected to be normal (read white bread go-along-with-it students) and of course they got herd results.
 
The person who would have rebelled and hit the fake guards in the mouth were pre-screened out and this gave a weird (and persistent) mistaken impression that everybody fell into the they were killing Jews, but I wasnt a Jew riff.

Where I would caution you, referring to back to your writing about, e.g., Alfie Kohn, is in ever thinking its easier to engineer systems than it is. Which is not to say it cant be done. But its a lot of harder than it looks, and involves dealing with some of the meaner aspects of human behavior.

In addition to the modern/primitive focus, I would also posit that sociology often takes a more statistically rigorous approach and anthropology is concerned with things, like ethnographies and case studies, that are anecdotal.
 
But if theres one thing weve learned from psychology, its that  for the most part  people are people, wherever you go.

I find your generalizations of both disciplines curious.
 
If all anthropologists did were to use culture as a basis of explanation, they wouldnt be much use at all (Why do some people celebrate Christmas? Its their culture, stupid.)
 
As you point out, there is no magical force known as culture and nor would any but the most nave anthropologist claim that as a reason in its own right.
 
What you describe as a sociological approach to your case could just as well be a social anthropological approach, examining the ways that the American institutional sexism has come about and the assumptions inherent in the system. This is culture, too. :-)
 
That said, I find labels like sociologist and anthropologist enormously unimportant. It all comes down to the methods used, and in that regard there is little to separate the two
 
Instead of describing cultural anthropologists the like of which (I sincerely hope) hasnt been seen since the 1960s, help clear the misunderstanding that these disciplines are so different from one another. Its an artificial distinction curiously maintained by people who should know better.

I have to agree with Andreas.  I myself have a degree in both disciplines and have seen first hand the differing methodologies and perspectives.  Its not that anthropologists end up using the term culture as a cure-all answer to the questions raised in the discipline no more than sociologists use society or institution.
The major difference for me is that while anthropology tends to study aspects of humans through as an organic mass of culture, sociology tends to study specific areas of a society.
Thus, while an anthropologist might study an area and make inferences on the overarching mindset, a sociologist studying the same area traces specific lines of social connections.
In the end however, the two are very similar.  Nevertheless they can both mutually aide each other, as shown by the numerous amounts of both sociologists and anthropologists using research from both disciplines.
 
As a side note  I personally found anthropologists to be more warm and engaging than sociologists.

But the actual science on the subject is much less clear: eggs seem to do a fair bit of selection themselves, etc.
 
In my opinion, this is a counter-intuitive result.  I certainly hadnt heard it before.  It seems to me that we should not attribute to malice what can be attributed to ignorance.
 
Also, isnt it possible that males did, in fact, evolve to be more competetive?  And if they did, then why is it sexist to say so?
 
Lets suppose the science is undecided on this topic.  How can we hope for a balanced analysis if one conclusion is considered boorish and politically incorrect?

An anthropologist might respond: But why does it seem counter-intuitive? Because of the sexism latent in the culture. The point is not that we cant say things that seem intuitive or offensive; just that we be careful to overcome our biases and carefully look at the facts  something the textbooks and Baumeister clearly havent done.

The characterization you make of anthropology might have been true about 70 years ago, but the field is a very different place now.  Political economy, pratice theory, anthropology of the first world, and on and onno anthropologist these days would simply boil down any social phenomenon to its the culture and leave it at that.  Also, the point of cultural relativism (and it should be noted that not all anthropologists consider themselves cultural relativists, although this was an important step in moving past the racist tendencies of early anthropology and sociology) is not that those people are different but that different expression comes from human universals reacting in different situations.
 
Anthropology and sociology have a lot of common history, common theory, and common aims.  You might want to read a bit more about anthropology before dismissing it out of hand.

I think you way oversimplify how cultural anthropologists view culture. You speak of them as if they formulate no theory, and as if they dont utilize the concepts of society and institution. You also fail to acknowledge the limitations of the quantitative approach (the most obvious example being how ethnicity, a word which itself has only the vaguest of definitions, is used to derive statistical data that is potentially misleading or unhelpful).
 
Lastly, Id like to point out that it was a cultural anthropologist, Franz Boas, who punched holes in the arguments of the same eugenicist scholars you mentionusing the same forms of measurement they did, no less, just done more accurately and with the understanding that succeeding generations of children born to immigrant parents were experiencing physiological changes due to new diets and environments, etc.
 
Point being, you do a great injustice to both fields with your flippant and uninformed analysis of their differences. Why would you cut yourself off from one or the other, when both come with built-in advantages and disadvantages?
 
It comes down to being a good scholar, period.

Thank you so much. This made me understand the differences between sociology and anthropology much clearer and made succint the nebulous distinctions I had between the two. If I were to succintly summarize the difference between sociology and anthroplogy I would repeat what you said in the first paragraph:
sociology studies society and anthropology studies culture. Put in another way I would say sociology studies what groups do and anthropology studies what groups think. Put in another way I would say sociology studies what makes groups of poeple the same while anthropology studies what makes groups of people different.
 
I once heard anthropology was the most humanistic of the sciences and I can see how this is the case. Personally I feel more attracted to anthropology because I am more attracted to culture than society. Plus I feel like I get enough hard science through the other subjects I study.

Wow.
 
Well, aside from the problem I have with your grossly out of date representation of anthropology as racist, I have a few problems with sociology, myself.
 
First off, no anthropologist in todays day and age would accept that the explanation for anything was because its their culture. Thats like a psychologist saying that someone is a serial killer because of their behavior. No shit. There is always some kind of argument made to explain HOW it relates to people,s understandings of certain concepts, in this case say by looking at how gender roles are created, understood, and reproduced symbolically within the social group which produced these sexist textbooks. Just saying culture as if it is something quantifiable is probably the worst thing you can do in anthropology, so bad anthropologists even have their own term for it: reification.
 
Rather than looking for simple cause-effect relationships, anthropologists are interested in the meanings people give things in the most taken-for-granted ways within their social contexts. A dumb blonde joke makes sense to people in Canada and the US because the dumb blonde has meanings which were historically created, are locally understood, and continue to be reproduced in our respective societies. Sure, there are pockets of resistance where people say this is sexist, but some people would argue that they arent talking about A dumb blonde, theyre just making a joke. Now, you can call these people liars and force them to admit their own internalized sexism, which would give you some great research material, Im sureor you could realize that on some level, this social trope is being understood through a different system of meaning which is somehow defining and reproducing (with varying levels of success) sexist beliefs, and instead look for WHY these beliefs exist in the first place.
 
You could do this by examining what qualities people associate with femininity, look at what kind of discourses exist about women among different groups (men, women, the media), how is the masculine then constructed as opposite to the feminine? There are so many venues of access to explore because anthropologists understand that humans live lives that are enmeshed in, and indeed lived through meanings.
 
What culture really is is still up for debate in the field of anthropology. I mean saying its a shared set of meanings, values, and beliefs within a certain social group is facile, but its the only definition we can really agree on right now. You can still tell its there though. Would you say that gravity doesnt exist just because we dont understand it? We can feel it anytime we fall, and similarly, we can feel our culture the moment we go to another country and realize how strange things look to our unaccustomed eyes.
 
Lets put this issue to rest: phrenology was NOT just practiced by anthropologists. It also ceased to be taken seriously some time ago.
 
Yes, anthropology was undoubtedly labelled the hand-maiden of colonialism and with good reason! It started out as a practice by missionaries and aristocrats, usually for the purpose of demeaning or converting other non-white, non-Christian civilizations. But sociology had just as rocky a past, and just as many who believed (as anthropologists of the time did) that certain primitive people were stuck in a period of history that Western civilizations had long since surpassed.
 
This being said, which discipline created the field of post-colonial studies? Not sociology. Anthropology was the first discipline to be self reflective about its role in colonization, and to this day, it continues to educate people about the fallacies of its past, something that was never explored in my sociology class. Not only that, but some early anthropologists (Franz Boas and his students in particular)were also fierce advocates for the groups of people they lived with and learned from in a period of intense and very institutionalized racism.
 
Finally, I have a problem with how seriously the other social sciences take themselves. To this day, anthropology is one of the only disciplines to really get that some things cant by their very nature be studied objectively. Anthropology tries to be inter-subjective, which basically means trying to see the world through the eyes of the people they study, and to gain some understanding of what meanings people ascribe to certain concepts through listening to the stories they tell each other about themselves. You cant ever hope to understand -all- the complex meanings people live their lives through everyday, but anthropologists try anyways, and thats one of the reasons why we have such a better understanding of the way other people live now than 30 years ago.
 
The main goal of anthropology is to try and see humans as humans, without trying to reduce people to ticks on a survey sheet, and without disregarding all of the messy, contradictory, and complex systems of meaning that go along with making sense of the worldand thats why I love it.

Very nice! This would actually be a very useful tool if integrated into a word processor like spell checking. It would help keep ones writing more concise.
Of course, when writing about business or politics (and especially when preparing a legal document), there should be the option to add redundancy, hehe.
 
As for calling it clichs I agree that that is the most all-embracing term to use. But for version 2.0 Id suggest a more fine-grained approach, e.g. separating clichs, redundant statements, idioms, jargon, buzzwords etc. That would be interesting.

Title: Museums and Exploratoriums
 
The San Francisco Exploratorium is widely regarded as one of the finest hands-on museums in the world. There are spinoffs in the San Francisco airport and a Klutz book. Like Richard Feynman,
the museum has become something of a touchstone of rightness for the science-minded community.
 
The Exploratorium is no doubt a fine museum, as far as such things go, but like all museums, it is deeply flawed. Like most media of American education, museums are hugely ineffective edifices.
 
The museum presents a golden opportunity to teach. You have a crowd that is explicitly seeking out knowledge, coming to you in person, giving you a large chunk of their time, and accompanied by their friends and family. It is hard to imagine a more ideal setting for education. And yet, this golden chance is squandered by boring exhibit designs.
 
Many museums simply present nominally educational things, like pieces of art or natural specimens of science, with a couple sentences of explanation. It is not clear what one is actually supposed to learn from this and in practice the answer seems to be: not much.
 
Science museums take things another step by showing actual examples of physical principles, and the Exploratorium goes a step further by letting the kids control them. But in my experience although there were many interesting principles on display, there was little learning. Each exhibit has been regarded as a little toy, to be pushed and prodded until you get bored and move on to something else.
 
Its not the visitors fault: the exhibit makes the principle at work less than clear and even if someone was interested in reading the accompanying text, it rarely says much more than the name of the phenomenon; no actual explanation is provided.
 
Museums have infuriated me on this front since I visited them as a little kid. I remember drawing up plans for a genuinely educational museum, and although I was extremely young at the time, the general principles still seem sound: split people up into groups, have them try to solve real problems, encourage them to sit and engage with something over time instead of flitting from exhibit to exhibit, make it just as rewarding for adults as well as kids. (My more specific ideas from that period, involving floating chairs going down rear-projection tunnels, seem a little sillier.)
 
But even in the multi-exhibit model used by the Exploratorium there is much that could be improved. The exhibits could use what Tufte calls small multiples to give kids a physical intuition about a phenomenon by letting them change the relevant variables, rather than just showing them one case. The descriptions could give the force vectors and equations for each examples instead of just the name. Some of it might go over kids heads, but even just getting them accustomed to such things is a valuable skill.
 
Museums, like lectures, seem to be one of those things that are simply taken for granted as a necessary part of being cultured. Cities have to have them, citizens have to visit them. Everybody involved feels virtuous about the enterprise and nobody ever asks if anything is being learned.

Thats not true. You just did as have many before you.
 
We have come to equate interactive with a wikification and theyre still in some broadcast model where interacting consists in changing channels rather than changing whats on the channel.
 
We are in the minority about this but we are also in the minority who wouldnt be allowed in the famous psychological experiments (like the prison one at Stanford) and hence those are made absurd with their claims about human nature, etc.

I agree - many museums do not connect dots, and do not inspire new conclusions.
 
There are some museums that promote viewer analysis and spark new conclusions.  For example, the Holocaust museum in Washington D.C. evaluates, through strong copy and powerful artifacts, the social, political, and economic factors that gave rise to the holocaust.  Every exhibit is well integrated with other exhibits on the timeline.

Hmm.  Judging from this and a couple of other posts  I really wonder why you bother writing these elaborate put-downs of one thing or the other.  They are all well written, often insightful but just as often they are very one-sided. One-sidedness is very helpful in making them concise and to the point but at the same time, makes them hard to take seriously.  It almost feels dogmatic at times (I hope this word isnt too harsh, Im not a native speaker and often miss the subtleties).
 
If this is a quest to define yourself in comparison to others and what you do and do not like, Id find it more worth your while if you made that explicit.  Just my 2 cents.

I largely agree with your criticism, but Im skeptical about there being some ideal interactive scenario that allows you to teach science to museumgoers. I have a much better time taking my kids through old-style archival museums like New Yorks Museum of Natural History or even Harvards no-frills Zoological Museum than a place like Bostons Science Museum, which is more hands-on and modeled after SFs Exploratorium. Part of this is what you describe: you approach an exhibit asking yourself, whats the game going to be this time? I get the impression that figuring out how youre supposed to interact with each exhibit and what the agenda is may crowd out the experience of learning in a more passive, contemplative way. I remember as a kid in New Yorks Natural History museum being impressed by the massive collection of specimens mounted behind display cases, a style of exhibit that seems to be frowned upon these days. But I took a lot away from it: the astonishing variety, how different species were adapted to a particular environmental task, addressing how to classify them all, etc.

Experiencing The Exploratorium as a visitor is like surfing the web without ever contributing content. Frank Oppenheimers vision extended to more than just an experience for visitors.  The experience starts with the creators of the learning displays. Why dont you make a display there yourself? The institution is  pretty open, or at least it used to be.

Hi.  Just came across your Museums and Exploratoriums post.
 
Research and evaluation in museums (some of which is summarized at www.informalscience.org) has shown that science museum visitors do learn, not just the specific pedagogical messages of exhibitions, but they learn about themselves, about the world, about asking and answering their own questions in a non-threatening environment, about sharing their ideas and proposing investigations. Perhaps museums strongest suit is to engage, intrigue, inspire, and delight: how often does this happen in school science classes? A positive experience at a science center can offer learners a radically different face of science, one that they feel welcomed and intrigued by. Childrens early interest can significantly shape their later careers: A recent study by Tai (May 2006, Science, 312, p.1143) shows that students who imagined themselves having a science career were more likely to go on and take a degree in science (even controlling for obvious variables like achievement and parents demographics).
 
Most science museums do in fact provide explanations, and the Exploratorium in particular tries to give visitors an explanation rather than mere vocabulary. But complex abstractions such as force vectors and equations have been deliberately reduced from most exhibit collections, in response to studies that have shown that they tend to overwhelm and intimidate visitors who do not already have science backgrounds. Adding information to labels also tends to decrease the chance that visitors will stop and read them, so the trick is to create explanations that are as brief as possible, yet feel satisfying to the majority of visitors. Just as the most effective teacher is someone who can translate science to the level of a learner, the most effective exhibit labels turn out to be those that invite the public to participate in something just slightly beyond what they already know, not those that present symbol-heavy physics curricula.

Title: Drugs and Guns
 
In movies, its clear when the camera is drunk: blurred vision, shaky motions, everything becoming slightly less clear. Its similarly obvious when the camera is on acid: rainbow colors, things melting into each other, and a sort of dazed gaze. Yet, despite the prevalence of pot, Ive never seen a film or TV show where the camera is high on marijuana.
 
Perhaps thats because theres nothing to show. Some deep breaths, a slight tingling sensation, and then an odd feeling as if something is pressing on part of your brain, lifting your head up, making you happy. An odd happiness, to be sure, but a happiness nonetheless. Friends are unable to distinguish between when Ive just gone skinnydipping and when Im simply high. Its hard to show a camera being happy.
 
Contrast this with Omega-3 fatty acids, the fish oil acids that various new studies are supposed to show have all sorts of positive effects for your brain. When I swallowed a stack of Omega-3 pills, I felt as if I was crawling up into my head, living in there instead of plotting the next moves for my body. It made it pretty hard to get anything done.
 
In San Francisco, medical marijuana is perfectly legal and health-food culture makes Omega-3 practically mandatory, but possessing a gun is actually outlawed within city limits (even for off-duty cops). To actually discharge one you have to drive south of the border, where shooting ranges allow deprived northerners to partake of this recreational craze.
 
Unlike the flowing, hippie vibe of drug culture, gun culture is strictly utilitarian: concrete walls, florescent lights, drab carpeting. Tough-looking guys take your license and hand you a gun. First-timers go into the training room for a quick primer on how to use it, then you take your weapon, ammo, and target into the shooting range.
 
Most of the targets are pretty bland  vague silhouettes or bullseyes  but there was one frightening option that featured a blatantly stereotypical illustration of a hooded bad guy character holding a gun to a cute young girls head. Normally descriptions of such pictures are more evocative than the pictures themselves, but this drawing was just about perfect.
 
Naturally, this was the target our neighbors on the shooting range had chosen and were now shooting at with enormous shotguns whose blasts shook the entire room. Meanwhile, I had a small handgun with a little bit of a kick and a simple silhouette.
 
My gun jammed the first couple of times I tried to shoot; I had to go through the process of unloading and reloading it several times before I even shot a single bullet. Its amazing how comically fake the actual gun feels when you do this  it makes all the noises and motions youd expect from a gun, but it seems to lack any internal mechanisms for doing the actual shooting, like a prop for a movie.
 
When I finally did manage to get the gun working, I relaxed, aimed my weapon, and took ten shots at where I thought the bullseye was. (My long-distance eyesight is really terrible and I hadnt thought to bring my glasses until now, so I gave it my best shot.) I shot again and again, the pattern of kicking and aiming becoming almost rhythmic. When the gun was finally empty, I pushed the little button to whirr my target back to me. To my amazement, nearly all ten bullets had gone in right by the bullseye. My partner looked frightened.
 
Whats odd about shooting is how, well, relaxing it is. Something about the furious action of the gun seems to drain you of all your nervous energy. And while, if you think about it, the item youre holding is a weapon of terrible destruction, theres very little visual evidence of that fact. Just as the gun feels like a prop, the whole thing feels like a game: aim, press the trigger, and some dots appear in a piece of paper. But when youre done you dont feel hyped-up like after a video game. Instead you feel as if what you actually discharged was your nervous energy.
 
We rolled up the bullet-ridden silhouette to take home as a souvenir. Maybe Ill mail this to my mom, I said. I dont think thats a very good idea, came the reply.

IIRC Prop H (the gun ban) was chucked out by the Courts over the summer. Theyll keep trying though, San Francisco feels the need to pass something like it every 10 years or so. Not that you would expect it actually accomplish anything if it stuck, the people who use guns to shoot each other probably dont care that guns are banned. shrug

Many of marijuanas (identifiable) effects are kinesthetic ( low blood pressure, heavy legs, warmth, hunger, etc.) rather than visual.
 
And relaxing effects of shooting seem to  me to be from the combination of relaxing (including dissociating from any startle response) and focusing that is needed to shoot well.  Ive noticed that rhythmic quality too.

Title: Medium Stupid
 
In July 1, 2004, Paul Krugman gave a talk about the state of the American economy. After the significant 2001 recession, the economy had begun growing again, with increasing growth in Americas economic output, or GDP. But, unlike the growth in the Clinton years, the extra money being made in America wasnt going to the average person. Instead, as the economy grew, the wages for the average person stagnated or even declined. All the extra money was going to the people at the very top.
 
In the press, President Bushs supporters complained that the public wasnt more happy about the growing economy Bush had given them. After all, hed pulled the country out of a recession; normally thats good for a boost in the polls. Sadly, Americans were just too dumb to notice, Bushs supporters concluded. If only they paid more attention to the news. But what these people are really urging, Krugman explained in his talk, is not that the public should be smart, but that the public should be medium stupid.
 
If the public was really stupid (i.e. uneducated), it wouldnt watch the news at all. Instead, it would notice it was out of work, poorly-paid, or otherwise having trouble making ends meet, and conclude that the economy wasnt doing very well. On the other hand, if the public was really smart, itd dig deep into the numbers to find that  surprise, surprise!  for most people, the economy wasnt doing as well as the headline numbers about GDP growth would suggest. The only way for the public to buy the Bush administration spin is to be medium stupid.
 
The medium stupid idea has much wider applicability. Most specifically, it explains the general state that the mainstream media tries to inculcate in the public. The uneducated American has a general idea that invading other countries is probably a bad idea. The overeducated American can point to dozens of examples of why this is going to be a bad idea. But the medium stupid American, the kind that gullibly reads the New York Times and watches the CBS Evening News, is convinced that Iraq is full of weapons of mass destruction that could blow our country to bits at any minute. A little education can be a dangerous thing.
 
(Along these lines, at one point I was working on a documentary film about the evening news that would demonstrate this point. The title, Medium Stupid, would also be a convenient homage to Medium Cool.)
 
The same is true in school. As Christopher Hayes points out in his genius article, Is A Little Economics A Dangerous Thing?, the uneducated American thinks raising the minimum wage is a pretty good idea  after all, people deserve to be paid more than $5 an hour. And the overeducated American feels the same way; like the dozens of Economics Prize winners who signed a petition to raise the minimum wage, theyve seen the studies showing that raising the minimum wage has only a negligible effect on employment. But those who have only had Economics 101 buy the propaganda that government interference in the market will only make things worse. And, as Hayes shows, this leads to bad decisions in many areas  the minimum wage being only one prominent example.
 
The medium stupid idea has applicability in other areas of life. The uncultured person who knows nothing about fashion doesnt mind wandering around in jeans and a t-shirt. And the overcultured person knows exactly what to wear to be hip. But medium stupid ol me looks bad and feels bad about it.
 
To work, propaganda, be it from the Bush administration or the fashion industry, requires you to be medium stupid. Know too little and you never hear the falsehoods. Know too much and you can spot it for a fraud. Which side of the line do you want to be on?

Thats an interesting observation, but Im not convinced that it makes a useful generalization. For this to be true, youd have to assume that people are rational by default. That is simply not the case and there are indeed many more cases where having a little education is preferable to having none.
 
The strong argument for laissez-faire economics (if there ever was one) is not that of the invisible hand, but that of moral objection to any unnecessary form of coercion.

So, Im still undecided about what position to take on minimum wage, but it does strike me that the whole issue is sort of moot.
 
If you want to help low-wage workers, why not support a negative income tax instead of a minimum wage?  That way, you run absolutely no risk of suppressing demand for low-wage work, and you can help people who already earn more than the minimum wage, and you can exclude people who dont need the help, like well-off suburban teenagers working for the summer.
 
(Aside: I know plenty of over-educated smart people who think that the minimum wage is harmful.  You can claim that they are all stupid religious zealots, but claiming it doesnt make it so.)

Consider two people, both work the same low-wage job, both hear on the news that GDP is increasing, the economy is improving. One thinks Oh, I guess my low-wage job is the exception, so I should try harder to take advantage of the booming economy. The other thinks GDP isnt increasing my wages, so the economy still sucks for me. Both have the same information. Both, under your labels, are medium stupid.
 
But only one is actually stupid, while the other is smart. Id say the difference isnt how much they know; its how they think about what they know. You can know a lot and be stupid. You can know very little and be smart. I dont see anythink here to suggest that a little education is any more dangerous than complete ignorance or full knowledge. I think the real danger is the concept of /enough/ education - the idea that once weve been told the answers, we should stop asking questions.

Ive never really thought that raising the minimum wage was that big of a deal, mostly because the final, politically derived, wage level is so much lower than most low-income people actually get.
 
When I worked at McDonalds in the early 90s, the minimum wage was raised(in WA state, or federal, I dont remember).  It didnt effect wages much, because after a few months, everyone typically got raises that pushed them over what the new mimimum wage was set to.  So it effectively raised the wages of employees who are in their first six months of employment.  (4.75 an hour to 5.25 an hour)  It didnt matter to people who worked their longer, because a person who worked there for 2 years was already at 6.50-7 an hour.
 
Over time ive come to realize that the polticially viable level of minimum wage, is far below the level of minimum wage that would be economically damaging.  It also only tends to effect minimum wage job hoppers, who never stay at any one job long enough to achieve significant raises.  (Agriculture would be an exception, but that farm labor market is distorted by illegal or undocumented labor).
 
The minimum wage doesnt hurt, but it certainly doesnt help.

And for some reason I thought the real reason for increasing the minimum wage wasnt to help those employees, but to allow Congress to increase the poverty threshold.  This is since the minimum wage is a factor in how to calculate the poverty line.

Im a bit confused.  Where exactly does Christopher Hayes say that the uneducated American thinks raising the minimum wage is a good idea or that Economic Prize winners support raising the minimum wage?

For one picture of why an economist would sign that letter, theres this: http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/can-600-economists-all-be-wrong.html
And theres really only a dozen top-talent economists on that letter, not dozens, and most of them are not prize winners, assuming you mean Nobel prize winners, as the letters footnotes indicate. Im sure dozens have won some $500 prize from their grad school departments or whatever, but no one would actually care about those.
 
Id really like to see you engage economic policy discussions on the issues more, instead of your if I change the words it sounds like religion! and everyone who thinks this is medium stupid theories. For example, as Mankiw points out, the main issues that an economist would weigh in this discussion are whether or not a modest increase in the minimum wage will actually decrease employment, and whether there is a large enough group of people unable to make more than minimum wage who will be helped by it. Wikipedia has a (very incomplete) entry on the various empirical studies that have tackled these questions and its still unclear. You could weigh the methodology and results of these studies and come to either conclusion. But arguing that the people who disagree with you must be intellectually deficient is not the way problems are solved and arguments are settled among the intelligent and civilized.

Title: The Grim Meathook Future
 
In the technology industry we have a phrase. We call it the grim meathook future, after a brilliant piece by Joshua Ellis:
 
I think the problem is that the future, maybe for the first time since WWII, lies on the far side of an event horizon for us, because there are so many futures possible. Theres the wetware future, the hardware future, the transhumanist future, the post-rationalist (aka fundamentalist) future.
 
And then theres the future where everything just sort of keeps going on the way it has, with incremental changes, and technology is no longer the deciding factor in things. You dont need high tech to change the world; you need Semtex and guns that were designed by a Russian soldier fifty-odd years ago.
 
Meanwhile, most of the people with any genuine opportunity or ability to effect global change are too busy patting each other on the back at conventions and blue-skying goofy social networking tools that are essentially useless to 95% of the worlds population, who live within fifteen feet of everyone theyve ever known and have no need to track their fuck buddies with GPS systems. (This, by the way, includes most Americans, quite honestly.)
 
You cant blame them for this, because its fun and its a great way to travel and get paid, but it doesnt actually help solve any real problems, except the problem of media theory grad students, which the rest of the world isnt really interested in solving.
 
Feeding poor people is useful tech, but its not very sexy and it wont get you on the cover of Wired. Talk about it too much and you sound like an earnest hippie. So nobody wants to do that.
 
They want to make cell phones that can scan your personal measurements and send them real-time to potential sex partners. Because, you know, the fucking Japanese teenagers love it, and Japanese teenagers are clearly the smartest people on the planet.
 
The upshot of all of this is that the Future gets divided; the cute, insulated future that Joi Ito and Cory Doctorow and you and I inhabit, and the grim meathook future that most of the world is facing, in which they watch their squats and under-developed fields get turned into a giant game of Counterstrike between crazy faith-ridden jihadist motherfuckers and crazy faith-ridden American redneck motherfuckers, each doing their best to turn the entire world into one type of fascist nightmare or another.
 
Of course, nobody really wants to talk about that future, because its depressing and not fun and doesnt have Fischerspooner doing the soundtrack. So everybody pretends they dont know what the future holds, when the unfortunate fact is that  unless we start paying very serious attention  it holds what the past holds: a great deal of extreme boredom punctuated by occasional horror and the odd moment of grace.

On first glance Im not sure I understand whats so brilliant about this piece. Firstly, I dont like its tone which follows a certain tendency Ive been noticing regularly, ie everytime a writer wants to really, really tell-it-like-it is, s/he injects a couple of variations of fuck and other short tracks to purported down-to-earthness. Secondly, one has to be quite insulated to find Ellis observations anything but obvious. So he argues that the entertainment branch of technology hasnt immediate ramifications for starving people? Get out, Id never have thought of that!

While I appreciate the bracing point he makes, ultimately its a rant. Rhetoric like the following does not strike me as particularly reasonable:
 
between crazy faith-ridden jihadist motherfuckers and crazy faith-ridden American redneck motherfuckers, each doing their best to turn the entire world into one type of fascist nightmare or another.
 
I also object to the notion that the sort of technology were talking about has little bearing on the problems of the worlds poor. For example, letting fuck buddies drive widespread adoption of GPS eventually makes it cheap enough to be applicable to, say, African food distribution networks. Mobile phones are currently revolutionizing commerce in parts of Africa, where corrupt/incompetent local utilities dont provide reliable land lines or electricity.

I dont understand the logic of your question, and what you mean by waiting. I guess relatively poor Africans waited for the price of mobile phones to come down to a certain level, but once they did, they benefitted from it, even though the phones werent marketed with poor Africans in mind. You might object to the trickle-down-ness this represents, but thats how all material progress happens: things that start out as luxuries eventually become commodities.
 
And the problem with rants is their often irrational component. Is Ellis seriously suggesting that the worlds poor have much to fear from faith-ridden Americans? Would that include people who donate to Catholic Charities?

I agree that the focus on web/tech people as the distracted saviors is mistaken, but theyre his audience. so
 
I also suppose that I disagree in some deep intellectual sense with the notion that technology cant change things, because my take on civilization is that society is the substrate on top of technology mediated by economics. But hes focused on the very short term change in technology here, not change in the civilizational-level dialectical sense.

You cant see the logic in it because thats not what was said/implied. Rants about rants are amusing but whats getting clouded here is that 100 years isnt really all that long a time - except when theres a race against oblivion (and even that is too loaded a term).
 
If you think Muhammad Ali was waiting for anything you havent paid attention - oh, I forgot, you werent around when he was Cassius Clay and now a main street in Louisville is named after him.

Title: Tips for Better Thinking
 
Go to the library and youll find whole bookcases full of books on how to write better. But look for a book on how to think better and youll be busy for a while. (The only major book I could find  Crimes Against Logic  was a dreadful little series of basic logical fallacies dressed up in political polemic.)
 
It cant be that writing is more important than thinking. While Ive met many people who cant exactly write, it seems that just about everyone has to think  even writers. Nor do I think its that the task is really harder. We know very little about the internal process of writing, so writing guides consist mostly of good and bad examples, along with some general rules. Surely one could do the same for thought.
 
Perhaps the answer is that there isnt such a thing as good thinking. But the case for it seems even stronger than the case for good writing. Good thinking is that which better helps us approximate reality  avoiding fallacies, missteps of judgment, faulty assumptions, misunderstandings, and needless fillips and loops.
 
And yet the subjects plain importance, I can find scarcely an article that takes up the topic. Where is the piece that savages bad thinking the way Mark Twain savaged Fenimore Coopers aimless writing or the way Orwell went after political abuses of English or, for more modern readers, Matt Taibbis dissection of Thomas Friedmans latest book? It seems like it would be just as fun  if not more  to watch a gifted writer slice and dice up a convoluted thought until it becomes apparent that its actually meaningless.
 
The closest I can think of is Chomskys review of B.F. Skinner (an unfair match-up if there ever was one  a bit like using a blow torch to clear off a dust mite). But Chomskys attacking Skinners ideas rather specifically (and, more generally, exposing the political implications behind bogus science); the essay is certainly not one in a series of examples of how to think better.
 
As one gets more skilled, the opportunities for improvement become less available  apparently because fewer people are interested in improving. The library gives free courses in how to read better, but these are for people who have trouble reading long books, not for those who already can but want to continue to improve. And there are courses in improving your writing, but they generally only get you from awful to serviceable, and not from serviceable to great. The same seems true of thinking  there are many books on fairly blatant logical fallacies to avoid, but few on more subtle improvements to thought.
 
And yet, at least with writing, people try. There are English courses in schools, taught by some of the greatest writers of the generation. And journalists can semi-apprentice themselves by freelancing before great editors, who slice and dice their prose until it shines. Yet Ive never seen a class or an apprenticeship in thinking, except perhaps incidentally.
 
The reason, I think, is because no one is thinking bigger. But that means theres plenty of opportunity. The fields wide open, folks.

Maybe its because its hard to work with thought alone that we need to give it form. Its difficult to collaborate and share with others without some kind of notation. Its also hard to gauge improvement without comparison.
 
Philosophy courses (with a good teacher, anyway) can help improve your thinking, but mostly by way of improving your writing. Good writing is good thinking.
 
The Tao Te Ching is helpful in considering these tensions between form and the formless.

Ive seen the book youre looking for. Its a 99 cent composition book.
 
When I write, it doesnt just come out. Sometimes I rewrite dozens of times. 500 words can take a day. Sometimes I change my mind about the topic entirely in the process. Peter Elbow, in Writing Without Teachers, says you should throw away your first draft. Delete it and start over. Then, if its not great the second time, throw that out. Because writing is thinking, youll have learned something between drafts. Starting over, you get to explore what you learned in previous drafts, with the untrammeled potential of an empty page.
 
Maybe, in the larger sense, Im proposing that the part of your brain that would learn to think is not going to do it by reading a book about thinking. Maybe it needs to engage itself with some output mechanismwriting, for example.

Well, the academic discipline youre groping for is Philosophy. But I think youre missing  or at least misphrasing  the point. Pretty much all courses in anything are courses in thinking first and their ostensible subject second. Many of them may be bad courses in thinking  many may indeed be courses in bad thinking  but the processes of learning and thinking are so closely interwoven there will never be a rule that splits one from the other.
 
The way to learn to think, is to think; practice doesnt make perfect, but it clumsily strives in that general direction. And because thinking about thinking gets tediously circular, the practice often involves learning about other stuff and thinking about that.
 
Certainly, there are lot of structures for thinking that have already been mapped out that it would be foolhardy to ignore  philosophy again  and an inquiring thinker might well want to investigate those. But thinking is  for all its highfalutin qualities  profoundly empirical. You just have to think it and see.

I would argue that Richard Feynman spent the latter part of his career trying very hard to teach people how to think better. His essay on skepticism and scientism (Cargo Cult Science, http://wwwcdf.pd.infn.it/~loreti/science.html), his participation on textbook committees, and his participation in the Challenger inquest were all at least as much attempts to show the value of rationality and penetrating thought to the larger public as anything else. He had a very hands-on view of how the work of theoretical physics is done, which is probably a large part of why he was so successful (on his blackboard at his death: Know how to solve every problem that has been solved.).
 
Which leads me to a very useful little book and the larger idea it points towards: How To Solve Mathematical Problems by Wayne Wickelgren (http://www.amazon.com/Solve-Mathematical-Problems-Wayne-Wickelgren/dp/0486284336). My dad once gave me an earlier edition of this work (called, more simply, How to Solve Problems), and its become something of a touchstone of mine over the years. The larger idea is that mathematics is, in its way, crystallized thought, and that time spent mastering the intricacies of mathematics generally makes one a better thinker and writer. Im still sort of mathtarded, but Im gradually (re)learning a lot of math, and I find its very helpful both in my software work and in my ability to think clearly about the world.
 
In the Classical Greek worldview, rhetoric, logic, and mathematics were all inextricably linked. I dont think they were wrong.

Dont assume nobody has had your idea just because you cant find any books on it at the library.  No matter what your idea is, its very likely that someones had it before you.  And thats especially likely when your idea is very general in nature, such as Aarons idea of a book on how to think better.  As others note, logic is the discipline that covers that ground.  If you cant find any books on logic in your library, you need to check to make sure you actually are in a library.  Step one: Examine your surroundings.  Are there canned goods and grocery carts around?  Thats the supermarket, not the library!  Look for the exit and try again.

Few courses teach much about better thinking. At best they select for better thinkers. Often they simply select for the best breeding.

Quote:
 
there are any number of at least superficially plausible ways of saying that you need civilization and education before you can have the vote. But Friedman, desperate to seem like the hip computer-age priest of globalization he has worked so hard to market himself as, decides instead to say that you need software (free institutions) before you can have hardware (elections).
 
But in the real world, does software naturally come before hardware? Does that make sense? Youre still scratching your head over that one when Friedman zooms into his next mangled metaphor. With Saddams iron fist now removed, he writes, the U.S. must help an authentically Iraqi moderate center emerge and sink roots. The correct word here is lifted, not removed. Friedman has left a giant Iron Saddam, minus one fist, hovering over Iraq, while the half-vegetable, half-human Iraqi center first emerges and then sinks roots.

Title: Think Bigger: A Generalist Manifesto
 
Our world is full of forces pushing us towards specificity. Open a newspaper and its divided into topic sections. Go to the bookstore and its divided into subject categories. Go to school and the classes are all in separate fields. Get a degree and you have to study in a particular major. Get a job and you have to work at a particular task.
 
The world needs specificists, of course, but it also needs generalists. And we see precious few of those. Its not hard to see why: try to do something big and everyone will try to talk you out of it.
 
Thats impossible, theyll say. Do that and youll only drive yourself crazy.
 
If that worked, dont you think someone else would have done it?
 
With all due respect, what makes you the expert on that subject?
 
Tell someone youre working on a dissertation about the mating dance of the East African dung beetle and they wont bat an eye. It would be the height of impoliteness to ask Is that really worth spending three years on?  even if thats exactly what youre thinking. But set your sights a little bit higher and people have no problem knocking you down. Come on, theyll say, furrowing their brow, do you really think youre going to be able to pull something like that off?
 
Dont listen to them. People are afraid of grandeur; it challenges the status quo. But you shouldnt be. Look up more should be your motto; Think bigger your mantra.
 
The first step is to recognize your place in things. If you study beetle mating habits, look at the larger mating patterns your studies fall into, look at the big picture of animal behavior, ask where you fit in the bigger question of what it means for an animal to behave. This is what I mean by Look up more.
 
But if you do thisand I believe you willthen youll find it hard to stay satisfied with your dung beetle project. Youll start wondering if you could move on to bigger things. Perhaps just a little bit bigger at firstanalyzing a few more types, discussing a few more implicationsbut soon youll notice that others have left the field wide open for the truly big picture stuff and youll start wondering why its not there that you should stake your claim.

Sure, at first itll be frightening biting off more than youve ever had to chew. But the fear will soon give way to exhilaration and the extra work involved will be paid for in the additional notoriety, in the joy of knowing that youve made a real difference. After all, do you really want to spend the rest of your life studying dung beetles?

The great generalists in the world are all experienced at specificity.  The worlds recognized generalists are the University Presidents (most of which werent career professors), philanthropists, renaissance men, etc.
 
If you study the mating habits of the East African Dung Beetle really well, you learn a ton about more than just the thesis topic.  You need to understand geography, the impact of climate, the biology of phermones possibly, evolution, taxonomies/norms, genetics (okay a stretch), etc.  And if you want to make a living out of it you need to understand project management (i.e. when to publish it), networking (as in finding someone interested in reviewing/publishing/funding it), marketing (i.e. making it sound sexy enough for the broader world), etc.
 
And if the mating habits of the dung beetle so firmly implanted in your mind happen to be applicable to helping guys/girls in a bar make better choices about who to choose.then youve made the world a much better places.
 
So, do specialize.  Just do it really wellWhich requires you to become a generalist.

Title: The Goog Life: how Google keeps employees by treating them like kids
 
Title: 1 is definitely the best thing. I spend a lot less time in meetings, dealing with support issues, talking to management, etc. than I did at my previous job.
 
I was talking with a friend the other day about that perennial subject of conversation in the Valley, Google. And finally she gave me the clue that made the whole place make sense. Its about infantilizing people, she explained. Give them free food, do their laundry, let them sit on bouncy brightly-colored balls. Do everything so that they never have to grow up and learn how to live life on their own.
 
And when you look at it that way, everything Google does makes a sick sort of sense.
 
Not a whole lot has changed since the last time I visited Google. The campus is bigger  the buildings across the street, instead of being reserved for lawyers and other lowlifes, are now being used by the engineering staff as well, to keep up with Googles nonstop growth. And the employees seem a little less excited about things than the last time I was there. Nobody says Were on a mission to change the world! anymore. Now they say, Yeah, Im just going to stick around here another six months until my options vest. and I kind of want to transfer out of my group but I worry that all the other groups are worse.
 
But the two blatant changes to the campus are a large, terribly fake-looking replica of SpaceShipOne hanging in the middle of the main building and a replica dinosaur skeleton standing outside. Its as if this place is being decorated by seven-year-olds, a friend comments. It also reminds me of Robert Reichs comment about Newt Gingrich: His office is adorned with figurines of dinosaurs, as you might find in the bedrooms of little boys who dream of one day being huge and powerful.
 
The dinosaurs and spaceships certainly fit in with the infantilizing theme, as does the hot tub-sized ball pit that Googlers can jump into and throw ball fights. Everyone I know who works there either acts childish (the army of programmers), enthusiastically adolescent (their managers and overseers), or else is deeply cynical (the hot-shot programmers). But as much as they may want to leave Google, the infantilizing tactics have worked: theyre afraid they wouldnt be able to survive anywhere else.
 
Google hires programmers straight out of college and tempts them with all the benefits of college life. Indeed, as the hiring brochures stress, the place was explicitly modeled upon college. At one point, I wondered why Google didnt just go all the way and build their own dormitories. After all, werent the late-night dorm-room conversations with others who were smart like you one of the best parts of college life? But as the gleam wears off the Google, I can see why its no place anyone would want to hang around for that long. Even the suburban desert of Mountain View is better.
 
Googles famed secrecy doesnt really do a very good job of keeping information from competitors. Those who are truly curious can pick up enough leaks and read enough articles to figure out how mostly everything works. But what it does do is create an aura of impossibility around the place. People read the airbrushed versions of Google technologies in talks and academic papers and think that Google has some amazingly large computer lab with amazingly powerful technology. But hang around a Googler long enough and youll hear them complain about the unreliability of GFS and how they dont really have enough computers to keep up with the load.
 
Its always frightening when you see how the sausage actually gets made, explains a product manager. And thats exactly what the secrecy is supposed to prevent. The rest of the world sees Google as this impenetrable edifice with all the mysteries of the world inside (I hear once youve worked there for 256 days they teach you the secret levitation, explains xkcd) while the select few inside the walls know the truth  there is no there there  and are bound together by this burden.
 
Such a strategy may have worked in the early days, when Googlers were a select and special few, but as the company grows larger and employees identification with it grows thinner, Google has to step up their efforts to acculturate. And thats where the life-size dinosaur replicas come in. Enjoy being huge and powerful while you can. Because, like the dinosaurs, this too will pass.

As it happens, I just visited Google Kirkland the other day. I have to say it was a bit creepy; the cleanness and brightness was overdone, and the abundance of lavalamps seemed affected. Our host mentioned several times that the furniture is all from the childrens section of Ikia. Hopefully none of this is in violation of the NDA I signed to get in.
 
Still looks like an awesome place to work, though. ;)

Any time that you start cooking meals for people and putting on shuttles youre risking the accusation of  infantilizing them. But is that a good reason not to do it? It would be sad world if companies didnt offer these things out of a sense of tough love or something.
 
Google has always tried to project an image of somewhere fun to work, with the exercise balls, the bright colors and the Segways. I liked the idea of SpaceShip One when I heard about it. Weve lost all sense of adventure about space. The X prize was the most exciting news for some time and its good that we recognize that.
 
Certainly Google doesnt perform magic in their labs, its just C++ code. But, none the less, it does seem to work very, very well. The air of mystique is probably overblown, but its not totally hollow.

People always seem to forget that dinosaurs ruled the Earth for much longer than humans can confidently expect to.
 
Recruitment is costly. All companies try to reduce the chances of their employees leaving, usually in far more egregious ways than youre suggesting here. Isnt what you characterize as infantilization just an expression of how wed all like to be?
 
Im not at all wide-eyed about Google  and at roughly twice your age, Aaron, I have my own perspective on the infantile  but as a company they do seem to try to give their geek employees what they want. How does that qualify as sick? Especially in light of the working circumstances of the vast majority of people on Earth
 
Its pretty churlish to complain that a job is so cushy it fails to prepare people for the harsh reality of marginally less cushy jobs elsewhere.

I mean come on Aaron!  Is the most parsimonious explanation for Googles retention ability really that, through some sort of sick psy-ops program, it has transformed us into hollow [wo]men who can no longer think or act for themselves?  Wouldnt the explanation that we all get to do meaningful work and get rewarded for it be simpler?
 
Whats preconceived?

I have no interest in brow-beating you into abandoning your position (that would be hopeless, Im just writing here so that your other readers hear the other side of the story), but it blows my mind that having an employee of google tell you that you are off the mark doesnt even give you pause.
 
Aaron, you are too young to go down the path of intellectual totalitarianism (to borrow a phrase from DeLong), but having read your blog since you were at Stanford, the changes are undeniable to me.  You are no longer seeking the truth, you are only seeking support for your own prophetic vision of the truth.

Im a relatively new Googler.  I joined here not to get rich, and I doubt Ill be a zillionaire anytime soon.  Im here because I greatly enjoy what Im doing, I have an enormous amount of respect and appreciation for and  in many cases  friendships with my colleagues.
 
If helping to reduce carbon emissions AND providing Googlers with safe, restful, free, and efficient transportation is infantile, then by golly, just gimme a pacifier now.  If the bouncy ball I sometimes sit on or stretch with is babyish, then just throw a baby bottle under my lowerback and be done with it.
 
Amazingly delicious free meals on campus?  I dont think infants would appreciate the tastes.   The fact that they are a much beloved perk AND have engineers happily NOT spending time driving and waiting off campus for food that sounds like a pretty sensible, adult benefit to me.
 
Basically, Aaron, all the things youve denigrated as infantile  the bright colors, appreciated perks, etc.  strike me as being good for employees, good for business, just, well, good for people.  Frankly, Im shocked why more companies havent adopted such pound-wise, penny-foolish ideas (hint: the bouncyball I sit on cost $50, cheaper than nearly any office chair; and while I dont think I should disclose the per-Googler costs of our fab food services, lets just say that its one of many things here that provides value FAR in excess of the cost).
 
I find it both interesting and disturbing that supposedly ALL the current and former Googlers youve chatted with seem to lack happiness with, much less passion for their job.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the vast majority of colleagues I have chatted with seem to be, on the whole, extremely pleased with the stuff theyre working on and the colleagues they work with.  I guess we tend to interact with folks who reflect our own feelings, values, and temperment and  given the stultifyingly bleak and often cynical tone of your blog lately  I suppose it shouldnt be surprising that those you interact with tend to be generally dissatisfied and unhappy with their lot (workwise and likely otherwise).
 
Given this post and your history of posts, Aaron, Ill simply close by encouraging you (sincerely) to cheer up, embrace life, see the good side of things a bit more often but Im guessing youll just find that to be patronizing and manipulative [sigh].
 
Regards,
Adam, who learned the hard way in college that always fighting, always questioning, always doubting and second-guessing makes for a pretty miserable existence and countenance
 
P.S.  I also thought the spaceship and dinosaur were way lame, but  in chatting with my engineering colleagues  I found I was absolutely in the minority on this.  Apparently, others derive a sense of wonderment and pleasure from such objects, and subtlely comparing these folks with Newt, Aaron, is neither particularly edifying nor appropriate.

Hey Aaron  if youre going to try to make an interesting argument, thats cool and ill listen to it, but you lose a lot of your credibility by making personal judgements like this:
 
Or generalizations like this:
 
Really?  You know what everyone at Google says and thinks?
 
The thing is, i agree that Google tries very hard to keep its employees happy, and it does so with a  rather young personality, and one could discuss whether thats a good approach or not.  But you really kinda destroyed your own argument here.

When was the last time you clicked on an Adsense link? I did my last accidental adsense click about 1.5 years back, Google and the adsense site owner possibly got few cents each..i dont know how the poor advertiser benefited from my accidental click through.
 
Recently I visited a cyber cafe frequented by relatively inexperienced internet users. I saw lots of people using google search, yahoo and google free e-mail, yahoo and msn chat clients. The two hours i spent observing cyber cafe users, i did not see single Adwords or Adsense click!!! People going from Google SERP page to adsense infested MFA pages are clicking the back-button in no time, looks like now most people can easily identify the MFA pages! Then who else is clicking on all those adsense links?

Thats not even remotely a fair comparison.  Its not like there was a particular species of dinosaur that ruled for all those 160 million years.
 
Mammals would be a far better comparison.  And although we mammals still have a long ways to go to catch up to the dinosaurs, our 65 million years and counting of ruling is not too shabby.

I dont know what I should and shouldnt say because of the NDA, but its probably okay to say Im married to a Googler. He hasnt been there too long, but the only problem weve had so far is that he never seems to want to come home!
 
Seriously, though, Ive seen a lot of articles that might be labeled sour grapes about Google lately. (Not to imply that yours is one of them - you made an effort to support your conclusions and it does sound as though you know some unhappy people, which is unfortunate.) The thing is, Ive seen my husband go through jobs at other corporations. Ive waited up for him on the nights when he was forced to work overtime on a doomed project. Ive been there for him while he struggled under the tyranny of dangerously ignorant management. Ive seen him waste weeks of his time because of thoughtless and fruitless penny-pinching. He started out so bright, so full of energy and zest for what he does, and over time I watched that energy and passion wilt under buzzing florescent lights in suffocating cubicles.
 
Corporate life in general is terribly depressing. I personally hate it and work independently. I love what I do and at least this way no one can take my enthusiasm away from me.
 
But thats exactly why I think what Google is doing is terribly important. More companies need to be that way. They need to be families who treat their employees like children - they take care of them. They reward them for their hard work. They encourage them to be creative, because they know (and you know, too) that it only takes one good idea to make a million dollars. Or a billion. Or an empire.
 
Ill say this: my husband has never been happier. For that, Im exceedingly grateful to Google. Theyve given him something that he deserves, that everyone deserves. I wish it were more widely available. I wish we all could be free to be children, to feel like its okay to laugh, to look forward to waking up, to nurture the bright and crazy ideas that wander through your head. That really doesnt sound like a bad world to me.

I cant really comment on working for Google, as I never have and dont live in the right area. But I can comment on this:
 
But the two blatant changes to the campus are a large, terribly fake-looking replica of SpaceShipOne hanging in the middle of the main building
 
I find this hilarious. Because for the last year and a half, this is what my wife has been making. She works for a company called WonderWorks. They make spaceships, big and small for movies and Aerospace museums. They had the contract for the replicas.
 
The replicas were contracted by the XPrize Foundation. They were made from the original molds. Scale Composites did the graphics layout, who did the graphics for the original.
 
So if you find replica incredibly fake looking I suggest you never go see the real SpaceShipOne. You will find it incredibly fake looking as well.

when i read this, i almost think of it as a good thing.  Joel Spolsky of Joel on software frequently says its a function of the manager to eliminate roadblocks from programmers in order to let them work.  Smooth out the chores and bumps in the road, almost like a secretary, but one that makes decisions, handles conflicts, etc. so you dont have to.
 
except at google, it sounds like the whole company culture is based on taking away distracting influences/worries such as i wonder how much the ___ is at the buffet today or i need to get my clothes drycleaned/fill up my tires
this sounds good.  programming is done only with focus and google seems to try its best to let its programmers focus on their work

Google is a monster. The new Microsoft. Dont let any of the hype fool you. Google, just like everyone else, cares about one thing and one thing only: money. And it is my belief that will be Googles ultimate undoing. Not surprised at anything they do. Keeping employees paranoid and happy is probably as good as any strategy for retention.

my buddy has been trying to convince me to join Google for a while now.
 
for those Googlers who posted above, I wonder at what stage they are in their tenure at google.
 
you cant trust people who just started working at a company.  everything is so fresh and new.  the real test is 1,2, 3 years into working there.  do you still love it?  could you work there forever?
 
as for my reasons why i wont apply to Google (at least not yet):
 
1) their MS-like arrogant attitude towards hiring.  i dont want to be quizzed on some bullshit stuff like HTTP Status Codes.  my buddy said he studied for weeks for the interview.  whats the point?  honestly, it seems beneath me.  (but I do understand the philosophy..)
 
2) wont be getting rich from stock options anymore, not anytime soon.   sure, if you get in now and work there 5 years, youve got a shot.
 
3) ive been working from home full-time at a kickass startup these last 6+ months.  G discourages working from home.  (this is the biggest reason for me, actually)
 
4) my own side projects are doing > $6k per month in revenue.
 
5) they wont let you code in Ruby on Rails or other obscure technologies like that which dont integrate well with the G Grid yet.
 
the guys from MeasureMap banged out a wicked app in a few months (in RoR), got bought by google, and are now spending years repurposing it in python so itll work with G GRid.
 
6)If you have any entrepreneurial spirt (like Aaron, w00t w00t)  why dont you 
 
 go out and build your own fing Google!!  (in your own mold)
 
My philosophy happens to be, do whatever you want, however you want, whenever you want, as long as it gets results.
 
Companies that require onsite too much remind me of managers who want to be my babysitter.  Why do you care where and when I work, as long as it gets done?  (its like they think just cuz youre in an office, youre actually coding or something.  we all know thats a huge load of BS)

Sadly most of the commentators seem to have bought into the Google reality distortion field (G-RDF).
 
Aarons comment that programmers have the attitude:
 
Yeah, Im just going to stick around here another six months until my options vest. and I kind of want to transfer out of my group but I worry that all the other groups are worse.
 
rings very true.
 
Any company that grows fast inevitably has the corporate change that comes over things and its terribly difficult - impossible - to maintain a culture that pleases all of the people all of the time. This reminds me of the comments people had back in the day as MS turned the corner from everyone wants to work there to its a job and at my one hit startup we went through our own mini-version when we were acquired.
 
Here at Monster, which is the coolest big company culture Ive worked in, we have the same problem, were trying to improve things, its working, but you know  youll never be perfect, projects will get cancelled or duplicated  and everyone has their GFS is unstable pet complaints.
 
So Google isnt perfect and Aaron - kudos for cutting through the (G-RDF). I hope they keep fixing things well enough they can keep putting out products I like (and I do like them).

I find it very disturbing that, while its not OK to generalize about other groups (and with good reason), its OK to do so with geeks. For example, its not OK to think that women are less capable then man at any task, that African Americans are different than Caucasians, and so on, but everybody keeps ranting about how everyone who is technically proficient will drool all over a shiny toy, doesnt need anything except a cubicle and a computer, and lives only for true mastery of some machine.
 
Im appalled that programmers even respond to that kind of Pavlovian nonsense. But then again, most programmers are kids in, or fresh out of, college. They dont care about not getting as much money as their employers get off their asses (you know - the stuff you buy groceries with), they think a union is a bunch of bits stuck together, and they know nothing about burnout (and by the time they find out what burnout is, theyve already lost their job to somebody in, or fresh out of, college). This is a nice recursive pattern for you geeks to ponder. You know, like GNU, MICO and other acronyms like that.
 
Take a break from the brainwashing youve now started to perform on yourselves, go rent Office Space, and keep the movie in mind when you go to your next interview and get asked Where do you see yourself in 5 years?.

Atmospheres such as Googles are only infantilizing if one is willing to be infantilized by such measures. Your assertion is only true for people for whom it holds true.
 
Perhaps more clearly: good job perks only make you act like a kid if you havent already grown up. I have a job with a lot of perks approaching Googles level of spoiling (albeit with a much smaller budget), and it hasnt made me revert to a ten year old mindset. I actually have a much more balanced outlook on life here than I did in my last job, which was much more by-the-book, 9-to-5, and certainly had no perks comparable to Googles.
 
It may be dangerous to try and make deductions of causation here, especially if the sample set of Google employees includes people who arent already hardened by the rest of the world. I can certainly see a fresh college grad going in to Google and becoming literally incapable of survival in a suit-and-tie job.
 
For me, I could go back to the rest of the world, if I had to. Id hate every waking hour of my life, but I already hated it last time I did time in the corporate world.
 
Exposure to a really rich working environment spoils people, to be sure - Im spoiled as all hell, and Ive only been doing this for 8 months - but the fact that we dont want to go back to a regular job is not at all related to our ability to do so.

my buddy has been trying to convince me to join Google for a while now.
 
for those Googlers who posted above, I wonder at what stage they are in their tenure at google.
 
you cant trust people who just started working at a company. everything is so fresh and new. the real test is 1,2, 3 years into working there. do you still love it? could you work there forever?
 
as for my reasons why i wont apply to Google (at least not yet):
 
1) their MS-like arrogant attitude towards hiring. i dont want to be quizzed on some bullshit stuff like HTTP Status Codes. my buddy said he studied for weeks for the interview. whats the point? honestly, it seems beneath me. (but I do understand the philosophy..)
 
Yeah, just like those damn universities that have those ridiculous assignments and exams to see if you know the material that you obviously know already.  Such arrogant tactics to evaluate their students.  Only Google is even more progressive and trying to figure out better ways to evaluate candidates daily.  Any constructive criticism goes a long way to make the process better.  Complaining about it just makes you seem like you didnt have the effort to be prepared for an interview.
 
2) wont be getting rich from stock options anymore, not anytime soon. sure, if you get in now and work there 5 years, youve got a shot.
 
Good.  I would be more interested in working with someone who is concerned with creating great software, as supposed to getting rich.
 
3) ive been working from home full-time at a kickass startup these last 6+ months. G discourages working from home. (this is the biggest reason for me, actually)
 
Im typing this from home right now.  Theyve actually been pretty cool about me working off site (and across the country) as I finish up my degree.
 
4) my own side projects are doing > $6k per month in revenue.
 
So you make a entry level programmers salary.  Great.
 
5) they wont let you code in Ruby on Rails or other obscure technologies like that which dont integrate well with the G Grid yet.
 
the guys from MeasureMap banged out a wicked app in a few months (in RoR), got bought by google, and are now spending years repurposing it in python so itll work with G GRid.
 
6)If you have any entrepreneurial spirt (like Aaron, w00t w00t)  why dont you 
 
 go out and build your own fing Google!! (in your own mold)
 
My philosophy happens to be, do whatever you want, however you want, whenever you want, as long as it gets results.
 
Companies that require onsite too much remind me of managers who want to be my babysitter. Why do you care where and when I work, as long as it gets done? (its like they think just cuz youre in an office, youre actually coding or something. we all know thats a huge load of BS)
 
And he talks about how Google treats us like children.  This has got to be one of the more childish sentiments Ive read on this thread.  The point of being onsite is not so managers can babysit you, its so that you can have the opportunity to interact with some of the most brilliant minds that the industry has to offer.  The fact that Im able to consult with the worlds  authority on many of the technologies that I work with makes my work all the more better in the end.     At Google, anyone could come in with an idea, and if it is a truly good idea can get the support of the largest, most robust computing infrastructure in the world.  Who decides whether an idea is viable?  The community of Google employees, not one manager or top exec.  Thats a pretty sweet deal for an entrepreneurial spirited person if you ask me.

The google life is an attempt to provide a utopian atmosphere for creative and productive work. However, it is clear that utopian working environments differ from person to person. Moreover people who think that an environment will be a utopia often find the reality to be insufficient for their needs.
 
Thus your insulting and speculative article is a reflection of the fact that a carefree playful atmosphere is not to everyones liking or to their best interests.
 
The idea that work can be carefree and playful, while at the same time remaining productive, is fairly new. It arrises from lowering social requirements for conformity to a masculine and professional norm, as well as the plenty provided by spectacular profits.
 
The conflicting attitudes here can be described by their architypes, The Suits and The Birkenstocks. For people of type S, Googles work environment is childish, lacking in discipline, and unlikely to motivate. For people of type B it is liberating, inspiring, and likely to produce comradery and creativity.
 
Now, to be fair, these are the extremes, and Google is actively trying to take the best of both worlds and mix them. The face that Google represents however looks much more like a type B workplace than type S and leaves itself open to these kinds of critiques. The reality, on the otherhand, is one where the individual is asked to conform to rigid coding guidelines and quickly produce stable and useful code. In a word, it is intense.
 
What makes Google special, as with all businesses, is the core group of people who began it. They combined an unusual disregard for the conformity of the business world, with a love of life, and an intense intelligence and passion to change the world in a realizable way. This is a very strange mix of libralism, daring, intelligence and ability.
 
What you have latched onto, the way Google treats its employees, is how the initial Googlers wanted to be treated themselves and how they worked best themselves.
 
Confronted with plenty many people lose motivation (myself included) and thus retire when they can. Others when confronted with a liberal facade assume a libral work ethic and are thus turned off by the reality. Still others, like yourself, are personally insulted by the way they would be treated at the company, and see personal independance (in all things) as a virtue.
 
Of course personal independance is not an objective virtue but since your article assumes your worldview is ubiquitous it comes off, as I said, as insulting.
 
If you were to write a useful article which outlined the personality types or backgrounds of the people you know who are insulted by, or not motivated by, their work at Google, you could add a significant piece of understanding to the discussion of workplace cultures, one which I would be very happy to read and distribute.
 
If you write that article, let me know.
 
Sincerely,
 
Ian Danforth

Google doesnt treat its employees like children, it decouples them from events not related to coding.

I just feel very sorry for the Google employees who made Google Video and then saw Google pay 1.6 Billion dollars for YouTube.

And, did you know how many stock option you get when you join Google now? I can bet that it is a number closer to zero and very far from 1.6 Billion United States Dollars.

Any company that wants to keep its employees happy provides a supportive, creative environment. Whether the company provides free food and bouncy balls in addition to that or as a replacement for that is my main issue.
 
I agree with previous posters that it is only demeaning if you take it that way.
 
I strongly suggest you read Microserfs, though. You hit one of the main story lines on the head, and extending the college experience may be why many tech companies succeed.

Wrong, wrong, wrong
 
I have never been in such a grown-up workplace in my life  and Ive been a software engineer for 25 years.  The fact that you see senior managers perched on beach balls is a Good Thing  it doesnt indicate rampant hebephrenia!

If people want to be treated like children, then let it be so.  If there was ever an example of a company engaged in an Icarus-like temptation of fate, it would be Google.  Just like all the other rec-room dot.bombs, Google will have its rude awakening and the kindergooglers will cry and whine about having their jobs taken overseas by Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs who work in dilapidated offices without the luxury of spending shareholder dollars on free lunches and big boy toys.  When that happens, what will all this talk of stimulating creativity and treating the labor force kindly amount to?
 
Theres no substitute for hard work.  You can have every degree known to man, be able to pass the cleverest entrance exam, be number one man on campus, and youll always get beat by the guy who needs it more than you.  Google is bloated, arrogant, overvalued, lacking serious revenue potential, diffused at the tactical and strategic levels, and has put far too much emphasis on book smarts in lieu of fierce, hot-blooded competition.
 
I use gmail and google search, but I could permanently migrate off either in less than an hour on a whim as soon as something better comes along.  And Ive never even thought for a moment about clicking any online banner, let alone adsense.

Aaron,
 
Your piece on Google is thoughtlessly reductionist.  Being cooked for and having free laundry does not make you infantile.  Neither does living in an office full of bright colors and bouncy balls.  I know several office on the west coast with paid lunches and nerf weapons that produce everything from financial services to solar panels - and theyre profitable.
 
My first job out of college was as a programmer at a large power plant in the midwest.  I had two managers with conflicting agendas, systems that were nightmarishly put together, and a job of rewriting all the code we paid millions to outsource.  My second job was working as a contractor, where I ran from 6 month job to 6 month job, never settling down, always worried about my next paycheck, never having benefits.
 
Now I work at Google.  I could care less about the benefits of free laundry.  Im happy to have a dental plan.  I dont feel as though Im infantilized, at all.  I work long hours and attend presentations when they bring in prominent scientists and researchers. Over break, I visited the University of Washingtons graduate computer science department and the camaraderie and atmosphere between computer science grad students felt very much like Google.
 
Lastly, Google does not lure programmers straight out of college.  Most of the people in my new-hire class had at least 3 to 4 years experience.  My most-asked question was where did you work last? and answers were usually another tech company such as yahoo, hp, or oracle.
 
Honestly, Id like your opinion on how a company should treat its employees.  Since providing comfortable benefits is infantilizing, how should employees be treated to make sure theyre grown up?  What is your definition of grown up anyway?

I can tell, with a fair amount of confidence that if google wanted to take care of my laundry, feed me lunch, and give me big bright bouncy balls, amazing colleagues, and a cached version of the Internet I wouldnt be sitting there thinking about how I was infantalized and saying But as much as they [I] want to leave Google, the infantilizing tactics have worked: [Im] afraid [I couldnt] survive anywhere else. No, I know I can, and so dont a lot of other googlers.

Aaron writes from the perspective of someone picking between a job at a hot startup company and a job at Google. In that context, theres some truth to the article. But thats not the context for the vast majority of readers, and especially not for people in general. Most peoples career prospects are blatantly inferior to those of Google employees (with or without infantilizing). Thus, if Google employees are made infants by their employer, it follows that the vast majority of readers must be made into something much worse than infants by their employers. Since most people prefer to see themselves as professionals to seeing themselves as inferior to infants, they have good reason to be insulted by this article.

One fact here is more telling than any other.  Many Google employees have chimed in with their support for the company.  However, none of these disgruntled Googlers Aaron talks about have shown up to throw in their support for his point.  Although Aaron claims to hear mostly negative things about the work environment, everyone here who actually has any authority on the issue (working for Google) is pleased with their lot.

I used to work at Google as a Contractor. Let me tell you, it wasnt the greatest place for a contractor. First, you have red badges, so anyone with a Google badge looks down on you. Already you feel left out, and you dont feel like enjoying all the benefits Googlers have. In addition to that, Contractors do a lot of the bitch work, but yet some Googlers do too. Like this one lady, who had an MBA from Stanford, was doing Email support! Im sure she was happy about that.
 
Another interesting thing I noticed is that the Engineers run everything! There is a constant battle between product managers and engineers. Its like they kinda hate each other. The engineers make it, and the product managers have to figure out what to do with it. Its like a treadmill of producing products.
 
Lastly, people have to wear many hats there. What I mean by that is everyone can contribute on other projects. What this does is, spread everyone too thin. You have maybe a manager for Gmail working as the manager for Desktop, and the engineer for Checkout working on the backend of Base. This is cool an all, cause everyone super smart, but come on now be realistic, you can only really devote 100% of your time to one thing and make it work. All in all, I miss the food. I dont miss working there. The people arnt really all that friendly, people have arrogance and MBA, PHD attitudes.
 
Oh yeah, and they only have like 3 or 4 people working on product marketing. Honestly, they didnt even know what the hell they were doing. Too much smarts equals no common sense. That was the only thing Google needs, common sense and hot girls. Data isnt everything.

Hey Aaron,
 
Your blog was recommended by a mutual friend, and Ive largely enjoyed it over the past month or so. Every now and then, however, you have a temptation to play de Tocqueville. You try to build a model or a theory for a place or a thing based on your observations, treating us to your views as to what makes them tick. Youre smart, and youre also a compelling writer, which means that most of the time you dream up a model that either speaks to some essential truth, or at least is deftly written enough to be persuasive.
 
Other times you get things wrong  sometimes because you miss the real big picture owing to lack of life experience, or other times because its seductive to find a model for things even when there isnt one. Ive seen this in your posts about Stanford, and intensely in your posts about San Francisco and the rest of Silicon Valley.
 
This desire to find a model/theory/summary/essence of a thing can be very compelling, and I appreciate the fact that you look for them in these expositions about the places, things, and ideas in your life. Its just that when you do get it wrong, its really wrong, and it stands out like a sore thumb.
 
Google is a place that its easy to be passionate about. Without seeming immodest, the work we do there has helped to change the world, and (I hope) will continue to do so in the future. Its a place where I can show up and end up working with some profoundly smart people  selected not just for the smart trait, but also the get things done trait: good company if youre the sort of person interested in changing things. Its also, and maybe most importantly, a place where the people running the show have a profound commitment to Doing the Right Thing.
 
Thats why you see Googlers reacting so strongly to claims that the stuff you see around campus is part of some effort to infantilize its workers into being afraid to leave. Its not because you hit a nerve  its because its so obviously not what they were intended to do. The best part about most of our benefits is that they are designed to relieve the burden of lifes bullshit  shuttles to get you through the ridiculous California traffic, free, amazing food within a stones throw so that you dont have to waste time, and more beside.
 
You might argue that the result of sparing people from bullshit might be some infantilization, but youre dead wrong when you think its the goal. It bespeaks to a profound lack of understanding of what the people and the place are about  like you grasped at the form, and missed the substance.
 
The other fun things you see  the ball pits, the dinosaur, the occasional video games, the marker board art, are exactly that: for fun! (Many of them are personal contributions from Googles employees and its Founders to Google).
 
There are a lot of fairly sophisticated arguments you can make about why people are more creative and more productive when they have fun, or when they have an outlet for stress, but I feel like this is a more succinct summary:
 
Would you rather work at a place that:
 
(a) Has a dinosaur
(b) Does not have a dinosaur
 
I know what my answer would be, but perhaps I have been infantilized by the nefarious practices of my employer. ;)
 
I encourage you to keep looking at Google, because  if you really want to write about what makes it tick, I feel like youve missed the point.

I was once interviewed by Google but they had nothing to offer me. I currently have a 7-minute commute-time between home and work.

I worked at Google for about a year.  The company provides food, freedom (20% time), fun (games, etc), and many other onsite amenities.
 
The employees tend to be on the young/immature/geeky end of the spectrum.  Most employees work on a small slice of big projects.  So it is not a place for people who wand to get their hands dirty in a lot of places.  Think about the challenge of optimizing a network of grid computers bigger than anyone can imagine.  Theyve got a team of people focused on file systems, a team focused on energy consumption of chips, etc.    But the people involved in those teams are free to be entreprenuerial and pursue a project like GDrive/Platypus or spending time waxing poetic about windmill power.  Its a neat place to work, but also a place where most of the employees are worker ants.

Reading this makes me envious of any large company that shows a sense of caring for an employee. I happen to work at a fortune 500 company that doesnt even bother to fake it for the employee anymore.
 
Overworked, underpaid skeleton crews barely keeping a $6 billion dollar a year revenue generating company going. The company makes a profit in spite of its top management. No more bonus, no no more stock options, no benefits except high priced health care options. All in the name of the holy stock price. Yeah, Id kill for a little fun at work no and then

I joined Google 19 months ago to work on GMail. It was a very long interview process, and I was thrilled to get an offer. I came from a mid-size technology company before Google. An ex-colleague from there got me to apply to Google. It has been mostly nice. The good
 
1.) It is pretty easy to concentrate on my work and be productive.
2.) The side projects are fun.
3.) Smart people to brainstorm with.
4.) A meritocratic atmosphere where confrontation is understood. Most people are used to having to prove their ideas.
 
Ok, the bad
1.) Collectivism. If I had a dollar for every time Ive had the Lone Ranger analogy used in a negative sense I wouldnt need my options to vest.
2.) Culture. Im in my 30s with kids. I would not recommend that combination with Google.
3.) No WAH. Ok, so its not that you cant telecommute, but it is definitely discouraged big time. This was shocking to me since I had asked about this during the interview process and told its no big deal. 
4.) The socioeconomic divide. Porsche driving developers always make sure that their non-Porsche driving co-workers are aware of their car keys  if you know what I mean.
 
Im definitely not looking for another job right now, but Google is probably a little closer to Aarons description than many Googlers would like to admit. Im definitely thinking Im going to get rich off my options, but the equation (vested options == pay off giant mortgage) definitely enters my head from time to time.

Thanks for your insightful artilce on what it is like to exist in Googles world.  I currenlty work at a startup where the owners dont get it but have taken my work and the work of other and will soon be unloading it for millions.  Good for them, but what about all of the people that helped them get there?  Well you got your small pay check, wasnt that enough?  From what you wrote, it seems that at least at some level Google is doing some things to take care of their people.  Sorry so many choose to beat you up for your opinions.  I find them at least insightful and allow for at least a measuring stick with which to compare.

I work at Google, and frankly, I suspect you need to broaden your circle of friends here.  Your description seems quite far from the day-to-day operation I see.
 
Out of ten thousand employees, there will be some who are unhappy, and some who are just putting in their time.  The question must become whether the free food, snacks, toys, and other cruft contribute to or ameliorate the unhappiness for most of the employees.  (And, I suppose, whether you want happy employees.  Google does.  I do.)  I suspect that the perks do much more good than they do harm, and not because they are making employees incapable of operating in the real world.
 
I am not claiming that Google has done everything right.  For example, I worked from home for seven years.  I miss the thirty second commute.  On the other hand, I am now around a very large population of very smart people.  It is pretty rare for a company of this size to allow full time telecommuting, so I accepted that tradeoff when I joined the company, even though I think they would get quite a bit of benefit from encouraging telecommuting more.
 
That said, they seem to do more right, and less wrong, as far as encouraging quality work, than any other company I have talked to lately, of even moderately similar size and scope.
 
As far as hitting a nerve, I would instead suggest that you were purposefully rude, and got a surprising number of reasonable responses.
 
A hint: telling someone that everyone you know at their company either acts childish, enthusiastically adolescent, or else is deeply cynical, and that the infantilizing tactics have worked: theyre afraid they wouldnt be able to survive anywhere else. cannot be taken as anything but an attack on the other people there.

Ren, Im not sure what you mean by the Lone Ranger comment (you mean decisions made by consensus).
 
But Ive found that WAH not a big deal.  Then again, half my team was in NYC  whats 5 more miles?
 
The main thing I disagree on is the Porsche factor.  I saw a much higher proportion of Porsches at my last job, which was not a big dot-com.  I dont think people actually flash their money here.  Then again, at my last job, I was reasonably sure no one had a Lambourghini or two tucked away at home :-\

InterestingI have a friend who works there and joined about a year ago in the marketing dept. The first thing she mentioned was that marketing is lower on the totem pole than the valet parkers, little to no respect (hence the fruitless search for a CMO). She also senses a bit of analysis paralysis - every marketing meeting she is in goes on and on, filled with pontification and action items with little to no real concrete next steps. The place is obviously run by the admittedly intelligent engineers and devs, and this is starting to show through a certain lack of product focusdomain registration? Cmon. Anyway - Ive heard similar thingsas much as Google is the media darling (The failure of Answers was actually lauded by many in the press as a success, go figure), cracks are appearing in the day to day strategic direction of the company.

No one but the founders of Google have the authority to make binding job offers without the approval of HR. It doesnt matter what youve done in the past, if people (besides HR) are making you offers when you show up, theyre hollow offers.
 
You have to make it through the interviews, and dropping out of Stanford to go work on a startup that failed only to jump ship to Reddit doesnt cut the mustard.

Interesting points.
 
This reminds me of Pixar. I have several friends that work there and have visited the office in Emeryville as well. They have a very similar atmosphere but moreso. Foosball, arcade games, comic and art everywhere.
 
In Pixars case, Id say that they want to create an atmosphere of creativity and ingenuity. From my visits to Google, Id venture to say that Google is attempting to accomplish the same thing.
 
Your observation about the dinosaur and SpaceShipOne are interesting. Even the use of the word infantilization is interesting too. I cant help but think that when we were kids we dreamed big. Those dreams werent mature or polished, but the sky was the limit. Perhaps thats not such a bad thing to have.

Gang,
 
Greetings.  An associate pointed me at this thread, thinking I might want to comment given my array of public statements relating to various Google policies.
 
I havent visited the Googleplex, but I have been out to the new Santa Monica center a couple of times, am in contact with various Google personages, and have a good sense of what HQ is like.
 
While I have certainly been critical about particular aspects of Google operations (especially in the privacy arena) I find the arguments about the Google environment promoting infantilization to be laughable.
 
In my view, the Google facilities and environment are clearly aimed at fostering creativity and retention  and of course maximal work output.  I see nothing wrong with any of this when implemented through this kind of carrot approach. Frankly, its the kind of environment where even an old guy like me wouldnt mind hanging out if I felt that I was accomplishing useful work.
 
I might add that all of the Google folks Ive met or otherwise been in contact with have seemed intelligent, friendly, and concerned about important issues  with nary the kind of dead wood so common in many organizations in evidence.
 
Theres plenty about Google to admire, and some crucial areas to be extremely concerned about.  But I do find the Google environment to be refreshing in a way that I havent seen even approximated in many, many years (if ever), and I always give credit when credit is due.
 
And besides, Ive always been a big fan of Lava Lamps.

Ive never worked at Google.  In fact, I interviewed twice and only
got as far as the second round of phone interviews.  I was shocked, to
put it mildly, that there were questions such as What is the tcpdump
command used to print out DNS packets?  This is the sort of thing Id
think they wouldnt ask, since it can be looked up easily, so no one
would memorize it.  OTOH, there are lots of thought-provoking computer
science questions that can be asked.
 
Anyway, Ive heard and read much about how smart most Googlers are,
and have even mused on that subject a bit myself.  All other things
aside, I dont understand how they couldnt have realized click fraud
would be a problem when AdWords and AdSense were on the drawing
board.  Or if they did realize it, how those services were launched
without tools available to help advertisers and publishers protect
themselves from fraud, or at least some warnings about the possibility
of fraud.

You wrote an interesting article. Google is becoming a iconic enigma, but all empires collapse. So we know what is now, but what is tomorrow? Microsoft also invested millions to make staff happy, and companies like Yahoo! have been very agressive in taking market share. So Google may attract a lot of press over its paranoia but its methods are widely used, in differing forms, but many US companies.

I agree.  I interviewed at Google and the overwhelming feeling was of a creche with computers.  The products are great and they are fantastic productivity gains when used to but tow rok for Google you have to either buy into the Google religion or you dont work there.
 
I was asked the same set of questions seven times in interviews and one guy was so in love with himself and his abilities that he was unable to relate to anyone of lesser ability.
 
I do agree with the company using resources to help employees get the chores done.  Thats just common sense.  But I dont agree with the star trek view on employees.  It takes all kinds to make the world go round and that includes some dumb people too.  There are many types of intelligence not just coding ability.

Just for reference, most high-security prisons keep very good food on hand. It helps keep the prisoners in-line by keeping their base instincts in check.

And yes, as was mentioned earlier, dorms would be ideal. You can keep people there longer and revoke their housing when they quit.  Talk about rentention programs!
 
Also they have done many studies that show the more hazing one goes through, the stronger the bond of the people that join that club.  Google is a club. To get it in was harder earlier (and still hard today), but thats the point. Make it a cult. You work at Google, pratically live there, wear Google clothes, have google friends, and have googly kids.

Google employees were slightly happier pre-IPO, but not by much. Hands down it remains the best place to work  worldwide  because weve been able to hire the brightest and mostly non-selfcentered people out there. Plus the founders/CEO have all the right values, so no matter what your function is at the company, youre contributing to a good cause. I too could retire tomorrow but chose not to.

Fascinating thread we might only add that the same strategy is essentially a military one at its roots: free combat troops from any rear echelon tasks which distract from the core mission. It is cheaper to buy laundry services and food servers from KBR et al than to waste esprit de corps and the fighting mans fire in the belly on mundane tasks. (Now if only the same could be said for powerpoint)
 
Having spent multiple years in hazardous overseas deployments, we often find ourselves peversely missing the no distraction lifestyle, even if food choices were poor (to say the least, compared to the typical American middle class variety) and the  overhead costs of that lifestyle far more difficult.
 
But no one would ever accuse our Uncle of infantalizing anyone in the field.

Thats why Google is one of maybe 2 companies Ive ever seen in industry that Id be super excited to work out.

Okay, my two bits.  I dont work at Google, I work near Google, I commute through the Googleplex to get to work.

I also very rarely see anyone who has the common sense to LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE CROSSING THE STREET!!!  Dammit!!  I swear theyve lost any sense of self-preservation.  Ive narrowly avoided many accidents because some self-absorbed drone figures that a crosswalk across a four lane 35 mile per hour zone is really going to make a difference when some other self-absorbed drone comes cruising along at 45mph in their Prius.

Its amusing to see so many Google employees tell you that youre wrong, as though the rest of us dont realize that those who like the shiny balls and spaceships and dinosaurs will, of course, be offended when you call them childish.  Further, Im tickled at all the claims that Googles employees are brilliant and super smart, yet they seem to be unable to write well.  Im not talking about a simple typo or misspelling, but rather grammatical errors that make a few of these posts unintelligible.  Also I suspect those lengthy tests to prove your worth to Google before they offer you a job is more of a gimmick than anything.  It makes all the employees feel special by giving them a false sense of accomplishment, employees can believe their co-workers are of a certain calibre (they must be smart, they passed the test), and Google can play it up to the world.  We have the best and the brightest, these PSAT scores are proof!  Riiiight.  Too bad the best and the brightest cant manage to put together a more compelling argument than, Youre a dumbass, and I can prove it, but this NDA wont let me.
 
The idea that a corporation will try and convince its employees that they cant do better elsewhere isnt unique to Google, however.  I worked in a insurance company in Kansas  about as far away from Google as you can get  and when work conditions there got to be horrific the powers that be pulled the you wont find a better job anywhere else routine.  Everyone does it.  Some people choose to believe it, and some dont.

Aaron,
Ive been over to google once for a charity dinner.  I was impressed by the fact that google sponsored the event because the head chef had volunteered at a previous (not at Google) fundraiser.  He wanted to bring the dinner to Google, and management let him do it and without charge to the social services non-profit.  I was impressed by that.
 
As to the infantilization, I have known a few people that worked there, and none of them struck me as infantile.  Just very accomplished, focused guys.
 
Finally, regarding the employee perks I think the commenters who mentioned Microsoft were pretty on point.  When a firm has wide margins, it can afford to treat the employees very well.  As those margins shrink and the industry matures, then things can change.  Other examples would be IBM and Bell Labs.
 
Nothing wrong with that though, its just the business cycle.  Nothing lasts forever, so we have to enjoy the ride while we canI certainly hope the folks at Google are able to enjoy their stay at the top as long as possible.

Try working in an office without the bright colors, with just shades of gray and beige.  At first, youll think it looks clean and professional, but after about 6 months, it really starts to wear you down.  The infantile point of view is interesting, but I feel youre interpreting it the wrong way.  To me, the colors, and atmosphere exists as it does to keep the employees happy, interested, and creative.  The same goes for the spaceship and dinosaur.  Labeling them like that is particularly self-serving to your point of view, but I feel they have more to do with science and technology, as well as innovation and education than giant playthings, as you seem to project from your article.
 
I dont want to label anyone, but this article almost reads as though it was written by yet another bitter person who was turned down by Google, and now has a grudge for having their egos busted.
 
I think that perhaps there is something childish about the way they do somethings, but you cant argue with the results.  We were all wildly imaginative and creative as children, so perhaps their atmosphere exists the way it does to try and resurrect that.

I have visited the Googleplex a few times, I know some nice and very smart people there, but  (and I know you were waiting for the but) everytime their recruiters call, and they have been calling an awful lot recently, I say NO, for one simple reason. Google allows for zero telecommuting.
 
Being somewhat older than the average googlekid, I am not interested in living on a high tech campus no matter how shiny the toys. I have a home, a life, a family - and most of the truly progressive high tech companies are fine with me spending time at home, where I work better without distractions anyway.
 
I like lava lamps. I like dinosaur figurines. And if I wanted to join a cult, Google is probably the best cult around. But the cult life ultimately just gives me the heebie jeebies.
 
Having worked at many other big tech companies mentioned in the posts above, I have to agree with the general sentiment that Google is just another big corporation, slightly past its peak. Everything else is hubris and self-delusion.

I am all for treating employees well, which in reading your article and many of the comments from actual Google employees seems to indicate.
I cannot comment factually about this but just read what others read about this and acknowledge based on my many years of management experience that many companies do not.
 
Where I can comment on Google here is that they possibly go too over board in treating there employees like Gods. As my experiences with Google staff (from we site management) is not good. They are extremely arrogant and condescending, especially the staff with their Adsense department, what a corrupt bunch they are.

 but Google has enabled millions of people to be able to earn a living (or extra part-time cash) from their AdSense program.
 
I dont care how they get it done (free laundry, free food, bouncy balls, etc for their workers) - but I hope their stock shoots to $1000 and beyond, and the AdSense payouts keep rolling.
 
Word on the street from some Googlers I know is that theyll never split the stock.  Like Berkshire Hathaway.

I read every single comment.  It took me an hour.  And I guess that in a way explains it.  We mostly love Google - as a web search engine - because of the ease with which we can do most of our searches.
 
I dont know why the media by and large chooses not to report on the negative aspects of Google.  Like the terrible long working hours(however enjoyable they might seem or be) or their horrible long-winding no-result-yeilding interviews and there could be a ton others.  Come on, a company cannot be all goody-goody.  And Google is definitely not an exception.
 
I dont know how long the Google honeymoon will last.  Maybe when more of their products are actually delievered(ie. out of beta)pun intended.

The whole infantilizing theory is just wrong.  There are reasons to work at Google, and reasons to work somewhere else, and reasons not to work at all (if youve been at Google long enough), but no one is afraid to leave Google because they wouldnt be able to survive elsewhere.  Thats just silly.  If anything, I think life at Google makes people overconfident, not underconfident.
 
I know many people who have left Google, many people who have stayed at Google, many people who have joined Google.  The analysis just doesnt ring true for any of them.
 
The environment is the way it is because thats the way the people running things like it.  Its not any deeper than that.  It was the same way when there were 20 people (in fact, some aspects of the environment at that time would seem even more childish, to Aaron).  Surely that doesnt mean they were already hatching a master plan for how to infantilize their 10,000 member workforce, and just putting it into effect six years early!  It just means thats the kind of environment they like.  It appeals to some people, and not others, and thats fine.
 
Google does have amazingly powerful computers and technology.  It also has a shortage of machines and unreliable software.  Theres no contradiction there.  It would be poor business practice if there were so many machines that there were no machine shortages.  (And that would be essentially impossible to achieve-as you give people more machines, they just use more and more resources, just as building more highways leads to more driving but doesnt eliminate road congestion).  It would be poor busines practice to refuse to use any system unless it is perfect and bug-free.  Google wouldnt have gotten to where it is, with attitudes like that.
 
I have no doubt that Larry or Sergey would have offered to hire Aaron.  I think Aaron is a very bright guy.  But I also think, as much as I respect their judgment, they arent perfect, and this particular offer wasnt such a good one.  Aaron would not be a good fit.

This is one of the more fascinating stories - and threads - Ive encountered.  Time will tell, but the snippets and press clippings in the aggregate point towards a bit more strategy than what first meets the eye.  When you combine paid search with checkout (and the purchase profiling it provides) the development of mobile search (GOOG phone?).  Throw in a recommender network and now a leading position in the evolution to IPTV.and all of a sudden, the forward P/E suddenly starts looking pretty cheap.
 
Personally, Id give my eyeteeth to have the opportunity to work at a place like Google. (or SAS) Any company that focuses on collecting intelligent, energetic people and then makes a major effort to treat them well/increase productivity/retain them should be jealously treasured and guarded.
 
As far as the infantilizing conversation, well I cant speak to thatbut I do have one GOOG story that you may find humorous.
 
I landed a GOOG interview about a year ago thru a visioning paper I wrote on virtual reality for an IPTV marketing slot.  (Im not an engineer, but a technical business guy - the position was for a security product manager, dealing with click fraud.  My guess is they liked the creativity of the paper, but ended up profiling my infosec expertise.)
 
Anyway, I had spent a good 6 hours prepping for the extensive list of questions we were to cover during the interview, but after rescheduling, then calling in 15 minutes late, the 20 something product manager (who while maybe a little naive, is Im sure a very nice guy) drops this landmine right out of the gate: Hi.  Sorry Im late, were having a little emergency here.  I know were scheduled for 30 min, but I only have 10.  Rather than reschedule again, how about giving me a list of all the things you think Google is doing wrong?
 
I kid you not, just like that.
 
For all you conducting interviews, its one thing if you are having this conversation with a fellow employee you know and trust.  Its something else when youre a complete stranger trying to convince someone who is in an obvious rush, with better things to do, youre qualified for a job.
 
Great, what direction should I go?  Was this a test to see if Id done my research?  If Id speak my mind honestly?  How on earth could I answer this truthfully, keep it in a positive light and get us onto something substantive in 10 minutes?
 
From the outside looking in, Id say it appears that what GOOGs doing right certainly outweighs what its doing wrong.
 
Strike One.  He insisted I answer the question.  We have some pretty spirited internal conversations on this subject, and its important we bring on people who can see the strategic hurdles.
 
Internal being the key word, you doofus, this is not the same. 
Do I dodge it again and risk losing him?  @#$!, okay you win.
 
Let me caveat that this is a complicated issue, but agreeing to self-censorship in order to play in the Chinese market may not have been GOOGs most shining momentfrom the outside, it seems do no evil became optional, particularly once the price tag got noticeable.
Hmmm. Okay, what else?
Alright, second Id say theres a brewing backlash that needs managed from the conflict between providing paid advertising over pure search results.
What else?
Third, Star office wasnt a big hit, so why go after Microsoft with this strategy?  Finally, the click fraud issue, and how youre adressing it.
 
Ka-boom,  man down, man down.  Medic!
 
Needless to say, he didnt like any of my responses, and proceeded for the next 9 minutes to argue why I was wrong.
 
Sorry, I need to wrap this up, Ive got another thing
 
I understand, but we really didnt get a chance to, you know, spend much timeWould you like to reschedule?
 
Sure.  Meanwhile, why dont you send me an email with the answers to the interview questions you said you received from the recruiter.
 
Sure, nice talking to you.
 
Click.
 
And that was my Google experience.  After a day of writing my response, I sent off the email.  4 weeks later, the recruiter says thanks, but no thanks.  Not even a reschedule.  Ive sent resumes in since, but no takers.
 
Ah well.  Some things just arent meant to be.  Ive been a true believer from the beginning and made a bunch off the stock, so I cant be too unhappy.  I also have some ideas on stickiness within 2.0 social recommender networks and where mobility is headed, so who knows.  Maybe my future startup may someday be so attractive
 
There are other ways in.
 
Maybe someday.
 
Anyway, Aaron, keep up the interesting articles, and Googlers, keep on keeping on.
 
Best,
 
GW

i agree.
 
ive been in the software business for about 15 years. what a lot of readers dont seem to realize is that Google is nothing new, really, and the infantilizing is nothing new either.
 
the giddiness of dot com came and wenta lot of us enjoyed it, but most watched with bemusement as people came and went, and bright-eyed college kids thought that software making really was like college.
 
it isnt. never has been. the sausage making is tedious. its not magical. theres a very good reason that the business has a turnover rate second only to the restaurant industrya fact Google, Intel (which Ive worked at), Microsoft (worked there too) are all too familiar with.
 
Google, you pointed out, is suffering everything all other grow-fast, try-earnestly-to-be-the-coolest high-tech companies experiencethe post-honeymoon letdown. the psychology of human resources is very intentional, though few employees seem to be willing to acknowledge the fact that theyre being  manipulated to fit corporate goals via HR.

Good Lord, people! Does NOBODY out there realize that LESS THAN HALF of the 10,000+ employees are engineers and programmers???
 
Really, truly - this needs to be known. MOST PEOPLE who work at Google are in SUPPORT roles!! And they are getting paid way less than industry standard for working 50, 60+ hours a week for it! Screw the free food, screw the laundry - the MAJORITY of people working at Google are in buildings without any of these amenities, and are certainly without extra money from stock options.
 
The support staff that make up MOST OF the company are the ones handling all of the phone calls from advertisers and publishers who are making Google money; they are the ones scripting email responses to users (yes, YOU!), who write in with complaints and questions - they are the ones working their asses off, in overtime, but that doesnt matter because they are salaried but way below industry standards for support positions, to make sure that YOU, the user, has an accessible Help Center, has a kind, email response, has an answer to your question.
 
Yes, there are foosball tables in the support buildings, but who has time to play them? Giant overhead projectors alerting them to the current turnaround time for their emails is Big Brother enough to ensure that they dont even THINK about playing foosball when they should be answering support emails. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are not nice alternatives - they are NECESSARY to ensure that all of the support peons remain dutiful and consistent with their email turnaround times.
 
Wow, sounds like theyre overworked. Cant Google just hire more people? HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! For a response to that, please see the above comments. Its as hard to get a support role here if youre an MBA with a PhD as a hobby, as if you invented nuclear physics.
 
Ive been here almost 5 years, and as soon as my refresher grant has vested, I am out like Lance Bass. Its a load of corporate baloney - the 400-person company that I started at has become a nightmare that has eaten my soul. God help the users.

 but Google has enabled millions of people to be able to earn a living (or extra part-time cash) from their Adsense program.
 
I dont care how they get it done (free laundry, free food, bouncy balls, etc for their workers) - but I hope their stock shoots to $1000 and beyond, and the Adsense payouts keep rolling.
 
So it is OK to disable accounts and keep the money of legitimate sites that have had malicious ad clicks just to cause these problems? Google could easily disable the ISP on these clicks.
 
So it is OK when Googles content Adwords display has almost 0 conversions as compared to the same ads on Adwords search? I hope not.
 
It is OK when an ad for Shell Wind Chimes appears on a personal blog with very little relevancy other than the word wind and shell thus forcing the reader to look elsewhere and click on these ads vs. a quality content site where the visitor is much less likely to click an ad? I do not think so; this is corporate corruption at its highest level.
 
If Google really wanted to do something about Adsense fraud they would. Google has the technology to disable ip addresses of suspicious clicks and should even disable the ip address of the business displaying Adsense and probably a certain geographic area around this business to prevent friends from trying to help but they do not.

Haha. Youre kind of an idiot, Aaron. No, really. Or youre just a jealous prick  dont worry; Im sure  you can get a job at Google if you try hard enough.
 
Anywho, whats wrong with making your employees happy? I dont see anything wrong with bouncy balls and bright colors. If thats what makes most of the workers at Google happy, the so be it; its not like Google isnt coming out with awesome things everyday.
 
Man, youre quite a dork. Go out and enjoy the sunshine and smile a little  trust me, its not painful.

I did an internship at Google and it was a very strange experience. When I finished, I didnt miss anything. Not the people, not the environment, not the work itself I left with the feeling that it had been too much trouble (months of interviews and ass licking) for so little satisfaction. The only benefit I can find for working at Google is the reputation you obtain, because of the image it projects.
 
I suppose one of the issues is that you need a certain mindset to fit into their culture. To me, Google looked too often like a cult of self-indulgent people that had been abused so much to get the job that lost all type of self-respect afterwards. To see people with PhD from top-rank universities working as code monkeys 12h per day, or MBAs doing payroll I dont know, I never got to understand it.
 
Another interesting fact that people from the outside dont realize is that, internally, many departments in Google are bordering disaster. Travel takes months to pay trip expenses. Payroll make constant mistakes. Security was taking two months to issue a badge. HR lost my documents several times and took months (literally) to issue an invalid contract (start date set on a Sunday).

Company culture aside, Id be more concerned with Googles long term strategy.  They are dominant in the text search market, have moved into the video market, and are making a ton of cash on ad revenue - but can the company truely realize its vision of organizing (and more importantly, capitalizing on) the worlds information?  If so, this company could truely change the world in a way MicroSoft only dreams of.  If not, how long until search becomes a basic commodity?

I used to work at what I suppose you would call a respectable, mature establishment next door to Google Mountain View, and as a female in the sausage fest of the southbay I got to go visit over there (as if I didnt already go walk the campus on my lunch breaks).  Our abstract brick establishment was the epitome of class with the palm trees, water fountains, and priceless 25-foot Chihulhy piece in the lobbyit was miserable.  Just because a place looks respectable, has a decent product, or has staff movie night every other month doesnt make it a rewarding place to work.
 
They didnt shuttle us in, did not provide food, fun, benefits, massage, etc.  They didnt have to, none of those things are required or necessary.  But damn if every day that I had to squeal in there at 7:30 AM (late because unlike the shuttle I couldnt use the carpool lane) I didnt envy even the badge-checkers on every driveway at Google because they were greeted with smiles, given freebies, and treated with respect.  I quit that job and if I can I will go be a secretary for Google because I want to be able to say I am happy at work, as childish as it is.

I usually refrain from commenting in these posts, but since particular post is worth noting.
 
My philosophy happens to be, do whatever you want, however you want, whenever you want, as long as it gets results.
 
That sounds like a pretty childish statement to me. In fact it sounds downright infantile.
 
And Ive never even thought for a moment about clicking any online banner, let alone adsense
 
Hate to break the news, but (shh, banner ads run on a CPM network, they make money even if you dont click.)
 
A true infant pokes fun at others to gain attention.

I believe youre also wrong on the assumption about the typical age of Googlers.  Until recently most hires had to have a few years of experience, so there is a gap in your thinking that they want to perpetuate the college life.

What is the problem of a company to make money? Has google ever bragged about being an organization that doesnt need to pay its employees? In order to pay their employees, they need to make money. It seems like a love-hatred/maybe jealous feeling about the company?
 
Yes, we all know that the management wants to create the faithfull employees or sometimes the ass kisser so they know their business is well taken care of or at least _ depending on the manager - like those who know nothing about their business, they would let their supervisors or employees do any sort of action so they arent bothered or even let alone. But talking about Google, it seems to offer more than most blood sucker/pennysaver companyes so,,, COME ON!!! Put yourself in their places!
 
Had you developed your own business, wouldnt ou be willing to have faithfull staff too? Probably too
 
If they are trying to make their employees happy, whats wrong with that? Why are they being pointed the spear when there are so many Enron type companies trying to mess  up with the employees lives? If some positive comments need to be addressed to Google, do so in a positive manner.

From reading your article, it sounds like the perfect place for you to work at is somewhere who doesnt give you any perks whatsoever, forces you into a dark cube, doesnt feed you, or help out with your transportation to work. Seriously, you need to lighten up.
 
Google does all these things to keep their employees happy, and it doesnt even need to offer all the great things it does, such as free food, shuttles, gym, laundry, and so forth. Employees are some of the brightest individuals in the world. I dont see whats wrong with that. Your reasoning that it keeps them infantile is just bogus and sounds more like a remark from a bitter applicant who has been rejected by Fortunes top best place to work.

Call me conservative but I dont like the Google Campus Environment at all - I think it would be annoying.
 
I wouldnt like to be subjected to Googles spend as much time as possible at your office and produce code for us in return we will treat you like a child culture.  Employers should be encouraging their employees to spend time outside of work with their friends and family as these are far more important.
 
I also note that when speaking to people who work for Google, if you wear a suit, because they know you are not one of them you are spoken down to - I wonder how immature and arrogant the community inside Google is with all those PhDs and so forth.
 
FYI Googlers, just because one does not spend every hour of his or her life slaving away for their employer - it does not make them any less of a person.  There is also much to see in life outside the Internet, despite what Google may have you believe.

I think that many of the criticisms that have been directed at Google in this article and many of its comments lack any meaningful substance. I would love to work in an environment where fun is not regarded as a sin and where food and recreational and other facilities are provided to employees. If only more companies were like that. I have worked in corporate suited environments where technical people have been regarded with contempt by sales and marketing people. It strikes me that this does not apply to Google.
 
Regarding the alleged weaknesses of GFS, I should like someone to name ONE type of file system which is totally free of problems, whether these are related to performance or reliability. I think that a file system which consists of such large blocks is amazing, and to have enough disk capacity to be able to use it to such effect is incredible.
 
(In order to pre-empt the usual abusive ad hominem remarks that are likely to be attracted by a comment such as mine, let me point out that I am old enough to be someones grandfather and I have  been doing UNIX and Linux and related troubleshooting and support and administration, etc., for more than two decades.)
 
Google seems to me to be a company which respects its employees, and catering to young peoples sense of fun does not mean infantilisation.

I have never been rejected by Google; never have worked there either, and no, as tempting as it sounds, I do not think I would.
But I had the pleasure to deal with some middle managers on a partnership, and I can tell you, their arrogance is simply unbelievable. On the surface, they appear to be a happy/friendly bunch of people. Their offices have Lava lamps, and free lunch. You see smiles galore. But once you start to DEAL with these people you realize how sinister they are. Creepy.
Cant go into details for obvious reasons, but the experience was very very unpleasant. Do no evil? Thats just utter B.S.

Jealous, much? Googles employees are the masterminds of our generation. In my opinion, they deserve the special treatment. I think other companies should follow Googles example and make some serious changes in how they treat the backbone of their organizations. Im sure you wouldnt complain if you were smart and determined enough to, I dont know, actually work there instead of sitting at home stewing.

Totally agree with you Aaron.  I work as a contractor at Google and it is offensive and discriminating to have the red badge.  Its like telling the world: look, I dont earn like you and have a short life here.
 
And I agree on the infantile working environment.  Its like a big kindergarten and I challenge you to find me someone with a bit of brain who genuinely likes the job he does at Google.  Its a massive call centre.

You said something about the cynisism of hot-shot programmers. Your entire article is very cynical. Have you ever worked at Google? You say you have visited, but dont think that just because you have done as such qualifies you to criticize it. Personally, I love dinosaurs and I love ball pits. Perhaps if you didnt have such a big stick up your butt and maybe had a little fun once in a while, you could see that Google is trying to make life more interesting for the people it has employed. I saw this article and I gave you the benifit of the doubt. However, your claims have little to no substantiation and you have failed to completely back up any of your claims. Perhaps an interview with a google employee would have been better. Otherwise, you disgust me with your own infantilizing.

Title: Eight Reasons (Some) Wikis Work
 
published at Personal Democracy Forum
 
The stunning success of Wikipedia in creating an encyclopedia from scratch has led many to believe that they can achieve similar results. (Want to get rich? Easy! Just install the MediaWiki software, title it how to get rich, and wait for the answers to start flowing in.)
 
Clearly the wiki approach does not solve every problem. So what made Wikipedia work so well? We cant say for certain, but by looking at similar sites that havent taken off  as well as those that have (like TV IV)  we can spot some patterns.
 
Clear goal. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Its an understandable task with a clear end result. When you want to know something, you know whether its the kind of thing that might be in Wikipedia or not. And when you want to contribute, you know what kinds of things to add. By contrast simply adding a wiki to your existing website has no clear purpose.
 
Worth doing. Collecting the sum of human knowledge in one place is just the kind of grand goal that inspires their people to sink their time into a big, collective effort. There are people on Wikipedia who spend their time going down long lists of computer-generated format and style errors, fixing each one by hand. Its hard to imagine people putting the same amount of effort into cleaning up a wiki about the greatness of Tide laundry detergent. But people are willing to do it for something only a few people care a lot about (like a very specialized technical topic) or something a lot of people care a little about (like a piece of popular culture).
 
Objective standards. Its pretty clear what an encyclopedia article should be. It needs to contain an explanation of what it is and why its important, the history, the uses (or actions), criticism, and pointers to more information. And the whole thing needs to be written in a plain, dry style. The result is that its pretty clear what needs to be done, which means everyone can work together to do it. Contrast this with a novel, where the books success depends on the authors creativity and, well, novelty.
 
Made from small pieces. Encyclopedias are huge projects, but theyre made up of manageably-sized articles. If an article ever grows too long, it can be split into parts (see Al Gore Controversies). When a page is small enough that the whole thing can fit comfortably in your head, its much easier to work with: you can write it in one sitting, you can read it relatively quickly, and you can remember the whole thing. Contrast this with books, which are so big that working seriously on them requires special dedication.
 
Each piece is useful. Each article in an encyclopedia is useful in its own right. Even if Wikipedia had just started and all it had was an article about the Striped Burrowing Tree Frog, that page would still be useful, just like every other page on the Internet about an obscure topic. The page, if it was good enough, would show up on the right Google searches and more Tree Frog fans would begin contributing to it. And if that page worked well, it could easily lead to others. Contrast this with a dictionary, which youre probably only going to use if it has a high percentage of the words you want to look up.
 
Segmented subjects. Few people are passionate about learning all human knowledge. But many more people are passionate about some subset of that. Encyclopedias allow the people who really care about French social theorists to spend all their time on that, without ever caring about the rest of the site. And the same is true of readers. The result is that lots of different people can work on lots of different parts, with the whole project getting done as a result, even though nobody worked on that explicitly. Contrast this with coming up with a theory, where the work requires understanding all the data and thinking about it as a whole.
 
Personally useful. The best way to understand something is to write about it and the best thing to write is a laymans explanation. An encyclopedia provides a opportunity to do just that. At the same time, it captures what youve learned in case you forget it later and gives the concept more form so that youre more likely to remember. By contrast, writing guides for children doesnt teach you much.
 
Enjoyable work. An encyclopedia mostly consists of people trying to explain things and explaining things can be quite fun. At parties, if you as someone about the problem theyve dedicated their life to, theyll gladly talk your ear off about it for hours. Wikipedia capitalizes on this tendency while also magnifying it  now its not just one partygoer, its the whole world listening. Contrast this with a project like categorizing all the pages on the Internet, which most people would find quite boring.
 
I came up with these principles just by thinking about why I use Wikipedia and not about specific examples of people who have violated them. So its a little surprising that it turns out to mostly be a list of wiki sites that havent exactly taken off: SourceWatch fails 1, vanity projects fail 2, Wikitorial failed 3, Wikibooks fails 4, Wiktionary fails 5, the over-specialized sites fail 6, Wikijunior fails 7, and Wikispecies fails 8 (at least as far as Im concerned).
 
Of course, even if you get all these things right, that says nothing about whether your site will succeed. Success requires more than just a good idea, it requires doing the hard work of actually making things happen. But thats a topic for another article.

Title: Seven Habits of Highly Successful Websites
 
I got a phone call from my father the other day. Oh, I thought immediately, hes probably calling to finally apologize for failing to attend that basketball game I played at in fourth grade. But no, I was once again wrong. He was calling to pitch his web startup.
 
Theyre at the racquetball court, the grocery store, the venture capitalists offices  you cant avoid this new crowd of so-called Web 2.0 startups. And every time they meet you, if theyre not asking for angel funding, theyre asking for suggestions on how they should run their company.
 
For a long time, Id simply tell them they should ask a real expert, like Dr. Paulson Graham of the Institute of Advances Startup Studies, but the number of queries has become so great that Ive decided to conduct some research of my own.
 
I picked out seven recent extremely popular websites. While perhaps not having the mindshare of a Basecamp or a Ning, these websites do have the benefit of having tons of actual users. Here they are, ranked roughly in order of popularity:
 
I looked at all these websites to see what they have in common. Heres what I discovered.
 
With the single exception of Flickr, all these websites are hideous. Facebook and Wikipedia redesigned late in the game, upgrading their web design from hideous to barely tolerable, but MySpace has continued on, its name becoming synonymous with design so atrocious it has actually been known to induce vomiting in epileptic Japanese children. Not surprisingly, its the most popular site on the list.
 
Unlike most of Google, Google Maps actually isnt such a bad looking website in itself, but most of its Web 2.0 cred comes from its ability to make mashups in which people stick a Google Map with several hundred thousand different little red blurble icons sticking all over it onto a webpage whose design sense can best be described as MySpace knockoff. Normally I dont go in for guilt by association, but in this case I think its deserved.
 
Del.icio.us and Digg both attempted redesigns at one point but due to a tragic mixup in communication, the web design teams they hired misheard their instructions and thought their job was actually to try to make the site look worse instead of better. Having blown several thousand dollars of their VCs money on this enterprise, they had no choice but to launch the resulting look.
 
Lets start with MySpace. Again, just as its a leader in traffic, its a leader in this category. MySpace has so few features, I dont even know what it does. Neither, apparently, do its users, who in fact create MySpace accounts simply to impress their friends and annoy their teachers. (Personal communication)
 
The last time Wikipedia added a substantive new feature was the addition of categories a couple years ago and, frankly, that was a pretty bad idea because it was so poorly implemented. Otherwise its basically just been a big box you edit text in with a bunch of kluges on top. Thats how it got to be number two.
 
Facebook, Flickr, and Digg all add features occasionally, but theyre more than counteracted by Del.icio.us and Google Maps, which in fact have actively taken features away. Del.icio.us decided that tag intersections (finding links that are tagged with two words) was just too hard to get back online after they were purchased by Yahoo! and so they simply took the feature down without notice. The site spiked in popularity until they added them back the other day and traffic went down once again.
 
Google Maps, meanwhile, has just removed everything else from the page except for the map and the search box, ensuring no features get in between the user and their mapping experience. Like most Google software, though, features are definitely not going to be added.
 
None of the content on any of these sites is provided by the people who made the site. In every case, the content is provided by the users. The only exception is Google Maps, where the content is provided NAVTEQ.
 
Combined with the last principle, you might begin to suspect that this is simply because the developers of these sites are extremely lazy. But I dont believe that; I think theres a more complicated principle at work.
 
I believe in a theory Ill call The Stupidity of Crowds. Heres the basic idea: if just one person or a small group of people builds a website, they have to be at least moderately intelligent. Buying servers and writing programs is somewhat hard and takes a little bit of brainpower. This means that the content for their site will be similarly intelligent and thus it wont be of interest to the vast majority of Internet users.
 
The glorious thing about the Internet, however, is that it allows us to aggregate the combined stupidity of literally millions of people. No longer do you have to try to play towards the lowest common denominator  now you can actually have the lowest common denominator build your site for you. No single mortal could possibly come up with the content you find on the average MySpace, let alone the hideous color scheme, garish backgrounds, and awful auto-playing background music. No, something like that takes The Stupidity of Crowds.
 
Like 99.999999% of all websites on the Internet, none of these websites supports web standards, the documents that explain the proper way to use the Web. Enough said.
 
MySpace, Flickr, Del.icio.us, and Google Maps all sold out to larger companies. (Google Maps didnt even launch until after it was acquired.) Wikipedia is apparently some sort bizarre legal construction called a donation-funded non-profit and this apparently has made it hard to sell. (Note to future founders: make sure not to incorporate your company as one of these as it can severely hamper your options later on.)
 
Facebook and Digg havent sold out yet, but I bet they want to. (Another tip: taking large quantities of VC money also makes it hard to sell your company, both because it gives you a swelled head but also because it gives the VCs control over when you can sell, and their heads are really big.)

Interesting you say that MySpace has few features. It seems like they are adding new tools and areas (recently listings, jobs, videos) all the time. In terms of social networks, they are well ahead of the pack feature-wise and technologically. As much as we hate MySpace for its horrible design and hacks, it is simply amazing how fast they move. Just my two cents.

Aaron, the only bad design is design that sends the wrong message. Would MySpace be as popular if it had a sleek, minimalist design? For Stupid looking for to gossip with friends, do you want your site to look intelligent? That would be like insisting the bar tenders at your dive bar wear slacks and blazers. Better design. Wrong message. Lost business.
 
Something else that I noticed: I know youre being sardonic, but it seems that sites arent successful because theyre ugly, have no features, or ignore standards. What I see is a pattern of indifference. That is, these attributes get lost in the noise of what makes the site successful.
 
Just off the top of my head, heres what I think matters most to users (in order)
 
1) Have I used this before?
2) Do my friends use this?
3) Does this do something I want with me having to think much about it?
 
Design sort of matters in 3. Features may be a toss-up (more usefulness versus more confusion), again in 3.
 
What really matters is 1 and 2, and if you can make it there, youre very forgiven for a too long time.

The defining difference here is that while traditional popular culture has a one-to-many relationship, internet popular culture has a many-to-many relationship, to speak in db terminology.

Interesting post although I would disagree and say that at the very least, Facebook has a nice, clean interface. Theyve also been rolling out neat features quite steadily for the last few months (or did you miss the News Feed debacle in September?). Theyve added blog-like notes (which allow you to import feeds), content-sharing a la digg, friend-finder (via your email address book), and the aforementioned News Feed. Their advertising is unobtrusive and minimal and I cant say Ive ever run into a serious bug on their site. It seems to me that theyve been the epitome of how to do things right by being quite dissimilar from MySpace, although I cant vouch for their code validating or their intent to sell.

I once told Caterina Fake that I thought Flickr wasnt going to go anywhere because it was too generic, simple and clean. And besides, I and all my friends were using Fotolog (if you want to talk about gnarly, ugly sites). She is nice and has not brought that up around me too often since.
 
That said, I think youre mixing apples and oranges. Sure, Flickr (to stick with what I started with) has cut features over the years, but they were features a site dedicated to sharing photos doesnt need. I mean, its pretty obvious what Flickr does, and it does a whole crapload of that thing: what more do you want from it?
 
If theres one Web 2.0 principle thats more than buzzword bingo, its this idea that David Hannemeier Hanson has repeated over and over: take one simple idea, and work on it until it works well. All of the sites listed above do their jobs, even if their actual purposes isnt immediately clear, and even if using them makes people who care about design and elegance want to poke out their eyes with thorns.
 
MySpace is for teh kidz to keep in touch. Facebook is for MySpace users, only sort of older and semi-sanctioned by The Man. And so on. Back when Friendster was young, I could see the limitations of its simplistic social networking model all too clearly, and MySpace somehow manages to be even more dumbified than Friendster. But you know what? MySpace is good enough for teh kidz, and I realized a few years ago that I have more real-life friends than I can deal with anyway. Being able to accurately model the character and degree of my real-life relationships would be interesting, sorta, but it would be tough to scale, would go over most users heads, and would probably cause all kinds of havoc if it actually worked.

Be Ugly
- ugliness increases approachability, because you wont think that this something else is better than you; instead, it belongs to you because its of a quality you, as amateur, couldve done yourself
 
Dont Have Features
- unclutteredness and minimalism, as opposed to portalitis, are the blessings of really useful tool websites; a hammer has little features too, and so does a pencil
 
Let Users Do Your Job
- allow a community to interact with your site sure, why not?
 
Ignore Standards
- realize that standards alone wont get you anywhere unless perhaps on a browser which really honors standards, but Im still waiting for that one to arrive

Title: The Politics of Wikipedians
 
A film director named Jaron Lanier recently published an essay titled Digital Maoism. The essay is a dreadful mishmash of name-calling, whining, and downright incoherence, but insofar as Lanier has a point, it is this: people often attribute facts and claims to Wikipedia, as if it was some giant hive mind that combined all our individual thoughts into one group opinion. But, in reality, Wikipedia is simply written by people, people with individual voices and ideas. And technology is making us lose sight of that.
 
(I maybe doing Lanier too great a service by attributing such a coherent view to him as nothing quite so clear is ever actually expressed in the article. Nonetheless, I will continue as if this is Laniers view.)
 
It is an interesting point, but what Lanier finds so frightening is precisely what I find so exciting about these technologies. I still remember the light bulb that went off in my head when my friend Dan Connolly answered a question by saying According to Google, X is the case. Google had said no such thing, of course, but the Google algorithm had processed all the links on the Web and send Dan the page it thought most relevant to his query. It was this particular page that said X, of course, but the notion that Google itself was answering questions in this way was a revelation.
 
The same is true of Wikipedia. There are individual people, obviously, but what makes Wikipedia so fascinating are the technical and social processes that combine their work, turning it into something no individual person is responsible for or would necessarily endorse.
 
I often find myself wondering what Wikipedia would say about such-and-such a subject or how important Wikipedia thinks something else is. I refuse to edit my Wikipedia page, not only because its bad form, but because Im genuinely curious about how Wikipedia sees me. Its an odd thing, to think a site that anyone can edit actually has opinions or concerns or a point of view on the world, but it does, and its a fascinating one.

At the end of the day, he is not against it in principle but simply warns that sometimes it can lead to the lowest common denominator. He then gives some tips on how to avoid this fate.
 
The other point to note is the really interesting discussion that took place around the original article. So I hope your readers will read Digital Maoism.

Title: The Politics of Wikis
 
Anarchism has a pretty bad rap. Put aside all the people who think its about smashing windows and shooting presidents and just focus on the idea (an arch  without rulers). If someone told you that you should start a business where basically no one is in charge of anything and everyone shares ownership of everything and all decisions are made by consensus, youd think they were a hopeless utopian about to get a large dose of reality. Yet thats pretty much what Wikipedia is.
 
Theres the obvious anarchism of wikis: namely, anyone can edit. No intelligence tests or approval rules or even a temporary probation. Anyone can just wander up and hit that edit button and get started. Where in the world can a random person get a larger audience?
 
Thats pretty radical in itself, but things go much deeper. Theres no ownership over text. If you write something, as soon as you post it to Wikipedia, its no longer yours in any real sense. Others will modify and mangle it without a second thought and anyone who quotes those words in the future will attribute them to Wikipedia and not to you. In a culture where directors are suing people for fastforwarding over the smutty scenes in their movies, thats pretty wild.
 
And while there are a few technical tricks to give some people more software features than others, for the most part the Wikipedia community is pretty flat. Every non-edit decision, from which pages get deleted to what the logo in the corner is, gets made by consensus with everyone getting a chance to have their say.
 
In real life, few people are willing to take such a radical stand. Even the farthest reaches of the far left hold back from proposing such extreme ideas, suggesting that not only that such extreme freedom wouldnt fly in a capitalist culture like ours, but that perhaps some of these restrictions are just necessary because of human nature. But its humans who edit Wikipedia, and mostly humans raised in capitalist culture as well. Perhaps its time to give more extremism a chance.

Ownership here belies the same fundamental belief of Intellectual Property - that one can own a work, whereas the most you can really do it create it. See all free software, which is pretty similar to Wikipedia in that anyone can change the source how they want, just without Wikipedias self-effacing nature.
 
I realise youre aware of free software, but I just wanted to emphasize the points that a) freedom to fork implies anarchy b) if you cant fork (eg, with physical objects), anarchy becomes a lot harder.

Functioning anarchies have been around in the computer communications world for a long time now; I thought back in the early 90s that the usenet had proved itself to be a particularly successful example.
 
But is it really an anarchy when the community is excercising highly coercive methods of control over its members? Sure, anybody can edit a page on Wikipedia and put up whatever they want. But if its a viagra advertisement, or is not consdered to be POV-neutral by certain people, its going to be deleted immediately. And this is necessary for Wikipedia to be what it is; if they really let anybody do what they wanted to, rather than forcing people to follow the Wikipedia way, it would be a true anarchy, and would be useless as an encyclopedia.
 
So in terms of level and amount of coercion, theres not much difference between Wikipedia and a totalitarian state. So whats the real difference between these two things? One would be that youre allowed to leave the Wikipedia state if you want to, of course. But beyond that?

Wikipedia might ostensibly be flat, but Im not quite sure that it is in practice. Theres the group of regular users at Wikipedia whom, by virtue of expertise, experience or coercion have more control over content than another group of people whose contributions dont fit into what the other group upholds as model Wikipedianism. That looks like a hierarchy, albeit a fluid one, to me. That, and what can otherwise be a beneficial lack of individual ownership almost covers up the forces at play.
 
My question is, how do you draw a line such that Wikipedia is an example of (relatively) utopian self-policing and not totalitarianism?

Title: Business Ethics
 
Moral Mazes (one of my very favorite books) tells the story of a company, chosen essentially at random, and through careful investigation from top to bottom explains precisely how it operates, with the end result of explaining how so many well-intentioned people can end up committing so much evil.
 
This weeks scene takes place inside a textile processing plant at Weft Corporation, where the companys poor low-paid workers are suffering from byssinosis. Byssinosis, also called Brown Lung Disease, is when your lungs fill up with cotton dust. Eventually your throat closes up and you suffocate to death. The company insists the whole thing is a stunt made up by Ralph Nader and other liberal do-gooders. But one day they change their tune:
 
Weft, as well as all the other large and medium-sized American textile companies, was actually addressing the cotton dust problem, but in a characteristically indirect way. As part of a larger modernization effort, the firm invested $20 million in a few plants where executives knew such an investment would make money.  The investment had the side benefit of reducing cotton dust levels  One manager who was in charge of the project  comments on whether dust control was a principal factor in the decision:
 
No, definitely not. Would any sane, rational man spend $15 million for a 2 percent return?  Now it does improve the dust levels, but it was that if we dont invest the money now, we would be in a desperate [competitive] position fifteen years from now.  It was on these bases that the decision was made.
 
Publicly, of course, Weft Corporation, as do many other firms, claims that the money was spent entirely to eliminate dust, evidence of its corporate good citizenship. Privately, executives admit that without the productive return, they would not haveindeed, given the constraints under which they operatecould not have spent the money. And they have not done so in several other plants and only with great reluctance, if at all, in sections of otherwise renovated plants where it is more difficult to  achieve simultaneous cost and dust reduction.
 
(Robert Jackall, Moral Mazes, 158f)
 
What does Jackall mean that the executives could not have spent the money  given the constraints under which they operate? Another story in the book about the chemical corporation Alchemy illustrates his point:
 
Consider, for instance, the case of a large coking plant of the chemical company. [Coking is a chemical process for distilling coal.] Coke making requires a giant battery to cook the coke slowly and evenly for long periods; the battery is the most significant piece of capital equipment in a coking plant. In 1975, the plants battery showed signs of weakening and certain managers at corporate headquarters had to decide whether to invest $6 million to restore the battery to top form. Clearly, because of the amount of money involved, this was a gut decision.
 
No decision was made. The CEO had sent the word out to defer all the unnecessary capital expenditures to give the corporation cash reserves for other investments. So the managers allocated small amounts of money to patch the battery up until 1979, when it collapsed entirely. This brought the company into breach of contract with a steel producer and into violation of various Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pollution regulations. The total bill, including lawsuits and now federally mandated repairs to the battery, exceeded $100 million. I have heard figures as high as $150 million, but because of creative accounting, no one is sure of the exact amount.
 
This simple but very typical example gets to the heart of how decision making was intertwined with a companys authority structure and advancement patterns.  Had they acted decisively in 1975in hindsight, the only substantively rational choicethey would have salvaged the battery and saved their company millions of dollars in the long run.
 
In the short run, however, . they would have been taking serious personal risks in restoring the battery.  their political networks might have unraveled, leaving them vulnerable to attack.  A manager at Weft Corporation reflects:
 
People are always calculating how others will see the decisions they make.  They know that they have to gauge not just the external   market consequences of a decision, but the internal political consequences. And sometimes you can make the right market decision, but it can be the wrong political decision.
 
(Mazes, 81-84)
 
Had the manager in charge of the plant with the ailing battery done the replacement, his department would be six million dollars less profitable. When it came time to compare managers for the next promotion, he would seem massively less efficient than the guy running the plant next door. Hed be passed by and his corporate ascendency would be over.
 
Corporate managers simply arent allowed to be moral, or even reasonable. And those who try are simply weeded out. Not only does the manager who replaced the battery get passed over for the job; the manager who was obedient enough not to gets promoted to a more powerful position.

I think the fact that time is not an essential component of stocks, and that time is an essential part of futures, is the major reason why stock markets are not efficient.  Regardless of what the market masturbators would have you believe.
 
Being on the back side of peak sweet crude forces efficiencies that could be neglected previously.
 
I am confident that all capital markets will move to a futures model.
 
And, all businesses will have to move to a futures model of accounting.  It would make stupidity like the neglected battery less likely.
 
Anyway, quit whining.  The same time businesses will be forced to introduce time into their accounting will be the perfect time to also introduce morals and human excellence into business accounting (the accounting system is practically the only way to enforce interests).  Stop whining and help me with ideas of how this new accountancy will work.
 
I need the answer for my own vile capitalistic purposes, so I am not acting out of pure altruism.  But a workable system would have the benefit of not perversely, systematically, stupidly destroying capital and humans and human dignity.
 
Anyway, I command you to work on my problem, and give me an answer, or at least some ideas, data, and studies I can work with.

Both of these stories show how large human organizations fail.  None of these failings are related to the fact that they are businesses, only to the fact that they are human organizations.
 
The WAY that they fail is related to the system they are working with.  Police departments are rarely brought down by accounting scandals, they typically fail by abuses of power, theft, or corruption.  Churches typically fail by people taking advantage of their socially powerful positions to abuse the weak, and often they have the same close the ranks attitude of the police.  Churches that dont have vows of poverty also tend to fall into embezzling.  Social workers fail by neglecting their charges.  Politicians fail through bribery.
 
Regarding the brown lung, Im a bit skeptical of the story.  Facemasks are cheap and easy to use.  Using facemasks in a dusty environment is common.  What is also common, is for workers to decide that the masks are annoying and distracting, so they dont wear them.  Facemasks, wrist guards, lifting belts, I have seen them all provided to workers before, and I have seen them all taken off by the employees because they felt they didnt need them.  Line managers arent that far removed from the employees, and often think the same way.  Ive been working here for 10 years and I havent had any problems.
 
Strong oversight, rather than morality, is what is needed.  Oversight for business comes from, in the first place, proper accounting practices.  Its difficult to make decisions when people are blind.  Pushing managers to make quarterly numbers is a normal human failure of long-term planning.  Proper accounting should highlight that.  Of course, if managment chooses to ignore it, then there is not much you can do.  The best way to refresh moral thinking, is to remind them that someone is watching.

Scott: Because the market is an individualized group of people searching for the short-term gain. They weed out the companies that think longer-term, not encourage them.
 
Mark: Its not an anecdote. The company was selected pretty randomly and studied quite thoroughly. Indeed, if there is a bias, its toward the company being too nice: it was one of the few that agreed to participate in the study. If this company has such serious problems, chances are they all do.
 
Id like to see an anecdote of ethical behavior that isnt similar thinly-disguised self-interest. To be fair, lets take the 42nd company (a nice, safely random number) on the Fortune 500 list: Lowes Home Improvement.
 
Norman: The book does give some examples of ethical behavior. Then it shows how that ethical behavior was brutally stamped out and all the people responsible fired.
 
William: What makes you think these are human failures? Theyre institutional failures. Are you seriously suggesting that Brown Lung Disease is made up? Do you think someone modified the archives of the New York Times to complete the hoax as well?

Aaron,
 
I dont doubt Brown Lung disease, and I never said I did.  I doubt that the danger to employees is entirely due to corporate greed, which was the point of your post.  Personaly safety measures that are uncormfortable and annoying tend to be circumvented by employees, just as onerous IT security policies are circumvented.
 
Even if the employees chose NOT to protect themselves, any illness related to Brown Lung would be the legal fault of the company.  However, I cant be morally outraged, since the dangers of Brown Lung are well known in cotton country.(Even before it had the name.)
 
I declare them human failure, rather than corporate failure, because they are not specific to corporations.  They are failures of human organization that appear in ANY organization as it gets larger.  The solution is the same in every case, increased vigilance by management and/or outside oversight.  I have rarely found a criticism of corporations that didnt apply equally well to other large organizations.

Excerpts:
 
Corporations are specifically incentivized to become engines of externality maximization.
 
The state should be able to incarcerate corporations.  Under the threat of conviction, big companies would start breaking up into ethically manageable sizes rather than profitably manageable sizes.

A small random sample is really not different from an anecdote.  Sure, the sample may be random in the context of a single study, but it is not random in the context of what books youve read.    Theres a selection bias occurring, by which a book that randomly examined two or three companies and found that they behaved ethically would not make its way on to your reading list.  (the fact that the sample is small means that all sorts of contradictory findings can be found by different authors with high probability.)
 
You are arguing a very general point (Corporations guarantee unethical behavior) from very shaky grounds, specifically:
 a) Some horrifying stories found in a very small sample of companies.
 b) A specious argument about how the stock market works, predicated on the easily contestable assumption that publicly traded companies never think long-term.  (The easiest counter-examples come in the form of large scale engineering efforts that take as many as 10 years to produce profits.  These cannot be done in a short-term fashion, yet publicly-traded companies still do them.  Why?)
 
And yet, you expect us to agree with you based on some stories told about supposedly randomly selected companies in one book?  Certainly coorporations behave very badly at times.  But to claim that they are inherently and irredeemably evil is just laughably simplistic.

Scott:
 
The market doesnt correct the problem because corporations insulate decision makers from the consequences of their decisions, or, in other words, because the government that grants limited liability to certain kinds of business doesnt allow the market to work.
 
This is intrinsic to the idea of a limited liability entity, and limited liability is where the problem is.

I too am a little skeptical of the brown lung story, due to the ease of obtaining face masks.
But still agree that there are problems, not just in corporate America, but in big Government as well.
The point Corporate managers simply arent allowed to be moral, or even reasonable. And those who try are simply weeded out. Not only does the manager who replaced the battery get passed over for the job; the manager who was obedient enough not to gets promoted to a more powerful position is well taken. My own business dealing as a production manager was very frustrating. The upper manage took a bottom up approach to all problems, that is that all problems could be fixed by getting more out of the lazy staff. My opinion was the opposite, I believe leadership starts at the top and no manager is better than anyone else (that is not to say that managers do not have more responsibilities that deserve a higher pay). When managers treat the staff with respect and like human beings and not like children who should be seen and not heard, productivity will and does improve. Compare United Airlines (bad) to Jet Blue (good) for a good case study.

Title: Competition of Experimentation?
 
It should be clear to anyone who has studied the topic that the way to drive innovation forward is to have lots of small groups of people each trying different things to succeed. In Guns, Germs, and Steel, for example, we see that certain societies succeed because geography breaks them up into chunks and prevents any one person with bad ideas from getting control of too much, while other societies fail because their whole territory can too easily be captured by an idiot.
 
It might at first seem more efficient to let the whole territory be captured by a genius, but a moments reflection will show that there are few geniuses whose brainpower can match the combined results of many independent experiments. This has fairly obvious applications to business and other fields, but for a moment lets just think about the concept itself.
 
This idea is often presented as a defense of competition and the capitalist market system that embraces it. Innovation only happens, such people say, when lots of people are competing against each other for the prizes of success. In a communist country, where Big State decides what will be worked on and how, there is no incentive to innovate. Only in a country like ours, where the victor gets the spoils, can new technology be developed.
 
And yet we also know that competition is a terrible way to get people do well. In No Contest: The Case Against Competition (now out in an elegant 20th anniversary edition) we see dozens of studies that show that, by all sorts of metrics, peoples performance (and enjoyment) goes down when they are forced to compete. Even worse, it goes down most notably for creative tasks  precisely the kind of thing involved in innovation.
 
How do we resolve the contradiction? The key is to notice that competition, especially market competition, isnt the only way to encourage experimentation. And thats often hard to do, because typically market competition is treated as the only sensible form of competition and competition as the only sensible form of experimentation. But thats not at all the case.
 
Instead of providing a prize for winner, we could provide rewards to everyone who tries. And that actually makes sense  not only because prizes also decrease productivity and creativity  but also because, when it comes to experimentation, its not really your fault if the experiment doesnt work. In fact, we want to encourage people to try crazy things that might not work, which is exactly why rewards are so counterproductive.
 
But even if you dont give an explicit prize, competition is still unhealthy. Contrary to what the apologists for market theology would like you to believe, people do not work better when theyre terrified of the guy next to them finding the solution first. Which is why we should look at this as simply experimentation, not competition.
 
Experimentation can certainly be carried out cooperatively. Imagine many different scientists in a lab, each trying different ideas during the day, swapping notes and tips over lunch, perhaps joining together to form small groups for certain experiments, or perhaps helping with little pieces of other projects in which they have particular expertise. Each scientist may disagree on which is the right direction to pursue, but that doesnt make them enemies.
 
Thats the way that science progresses. And, if you let it, other things too.

Are you sure you arent over-generalizing? Although rewards and prizes may decrease productivity when it comes to learning things, or working on intellectually sexy projects, that cant be true for everything. And arent most things (even on the innovative side) not all that intellectually interesting?
 
Or am I misunderstanding what youre implying we should apply these ideas to?

As Guns, Germs and Steel also points out in the chapter on domesticable animals, there is no factor which makes an animal domesticable. But there are any number of different factors which alone will make the animal un-domesticable.
 
Similarly, there is no one factor that will encourage innovative behavior. A certain percentage of the population is creative and productive, and doesnt really need any incentive to be so. However, there are many factors which will suppress this natural urge.
 
A big one is the apathy of ones peers. Another big one is the lack of resources (money, tools or connections) which a person needs to take something from idea to experiment to result. The need to fulfil the daily grind to earn ones bread might seem like another one, but it depends on how much of ones enery is lost to this activity. Einstein worked in the patent office, for example.

Thats sort of a fantasy-land idea of science.  Rivalries among scientists and mathmeticians are just as bitter as any other.  (Newton/Liebniz, Teller/Oppenheimer, Kronecker/Cantor, and so on).
 
Aside from that, I have two questions about your thesis:

Im a bit driven to distraction by the discussion of what capitalists are supposed to believe. Even the most ardent free-marketeer would have to admit that the Soviet Union, the epitome of top-down decisionmaking, was still able to develop many new technologies, particularly in the areas of nuclear weapons and space travel. The question is which approach is optimal. It also represents a poor understanding of market competition to insist that being forced to compete and the terror that entails is necessarily preferable to being simply free to compete, which can be a laid-back affair. And many rewards are non-monetary. You may help develop a lasting idea for little or no pay, yet still be rewarded in prestige. Rewards also include the much greater satisfaction you derive from helping to develop something that works than something that doesnt.

Trying something new is its own reward.
 
The only way you can stop people from trying to invent new sources of value is to punish/kill them for trying.
 
And there are plenty of social organizations that will punish/kill you for trying.
 
If you dont sell yourself into wage-slavery, and if you are not currently in the cross-hairs of the thugs with machine guns, you will notice resources to nurture and disseminate discovery, far beyond what Galileo had access to.
 
Otherwise, you have to keep your head down, and hope you are found out only after it is too late.
 
But I agree with you, the best that can be said about the competitive capital markets (considered along with the societal, legal, and governmental frameworks that actually make the market possible) is that they punish only a percentage of people who are trying to invent new sources of value.  They dont manage to punish 100%.  Yet.

I disagree.
 
Consider the subject of automated vehicles.  This is somewhat of a sexy field, and many groups have worked on it over time, with mixed results.
 
Enter the DARPA Grand Challenge.  Many teams, lots of work, 2 years, and now we have vehicles that can travel 100 miles autonomously.  There are limitations, but this contest had a huge impact on the progress in this field.
 
The Ansari X-Prize worked equally well, and several of the contestants are still developing their projects, even though the contest was won some time ago.
 
I havent read the books cited, but these are two rather significant counter examples.

Aaron, I find that you generally have a utopian vision of how science works. Ive been to labs that so hyper-competitive that the lab boss assigns the same project to different members of the lab, where it is expected that whoever gets the project working first gets all the glory.
 
In science, publishing first is so important, because sometimes you are unable to publish if the result is too close to something that is already published. Ive seen grad students lose years of work by being pipped to the finishing line in publishing.
 
I can name you rivalries in my field, where bombastic assholes hold important positions in university hiring committees, grant committees. These people hold real power in terms of providing resources and recognition to advance their competitors career. This holds for advancing the interests of vulnerable postdocs as they make their up the acadmeic ladder.
 
And science is becoming way less collegial and more cut-throat. Across the board, its expected that only 10% of postdocs will get a professorship. And thats a conservatively high figure.

Title: The City with No Heart
 
[Wheres the heart of LA?]
 
CAL: The Hollywood sign.
 
DANNY: Its the most viewed sign in the world, it beats the Eiffel Tower. And dont say the Santa Monica pier.
 
CAL: Downtown.
 
DANNY: Downtown isnt where L.A. is.
 
CAL: Its not. L.A.s on Sunset between Doheny and Highland. Its the Sunset Strip, and Wes knew that because he put that right in the title.
 
DANNY: Hey, I would love to do the Strip, but if you think about it, its made up almost entirely of billboard ads.
 
(Aaron Sorkin, The Option Period, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip)
 
Flying over Los Angeles is strange. For a while theres nothing but mountains. Then a few curving strips of conformist suburbia. And then, all of a sudden, there it is. Rows and rows of building with no apparent structure or direction, just going everywhere at once. Unlike every other city Ive seen from the air, LA has no gradient surrounding a downtown. It just suddenly appears and then is simply there.
 
Downtown looks about the way youd expect. Lots of tall buildings, studded with odd landmarks like the new Gehry-designed concert hall and a giant ocean liner-looking building which we determined to be the DMV. (Only in California does the DMV get its own ocean liner, someone says.) But this wasnt really LA, my guide explained. Downtown is just hollowed out factories and sweatshops. Gentrification is coming, but its only at the very early stages. We pass an American Apparel sweatshop. American Apparel is a Rebel Company the staid building reads in Spanish.
 
We zip past old and new buildings while zooming on the freeway and head to Venice, a land of small streets and surprisingly-elegant beach shacks. The famed Venice Beach looks just like youd imagine  LA always makes you think you are imagining  with shirtless skateboarders and gritty little shops and the beautiful blue ocean up against the clear blue sky  both so vast, so endless.
 
I lie down on the sand and close my eyes. When youre trying to relax, everyone always says to imagine youre on the beach by the ocean with the sun streaming down upon your face. But here I actually am and I still cant relax. Instead, I wonder about the fractal nature of coastlines  does their length grow with out bound or simply converge as you measure them more finely? (It grows without bound.)
 
My host is danah boyd, the beautiful young academic superstar who has won fame and fortune formalizing the teens on MySpace, then reporting her findings at conferences in wildly colorful outfits with youthful enthusiasm. Shes living an academic dream  a one bedroom house by the beach filled with books, with a handsome but quiet young boyfriend to drop by on occasion.
 
But such a life is not all relaxation. Shes editing special editions of journals, keynoting conferences, submitting papers hither and yon, consulting on teen issues for major corporations, and interviewing kids for her research. Even The OReilly Factor is in on the racket, asking her, in that rhetorical way OReilly has of interviewing guests, whether MySpace is a dangerous den of online sexual predators. (It is never mentioned that OReillys parent company has purchased MySpace.)
 
danah delights in pushing academic boundaries: skipping classes, skipping town, spelling her name in lower case, wearing crazy clothes, studying the subcultural and new. And the rest of the field is scrambling to catch up with her, finally holding conferences and submitting papers on the sites shes been studying for years. I should become an academic, she says. Shake up the system just like her. But why join the system in the first place?, I say.
 
Shes got a fellowship down here this year along with Cory Doctorow, who shows up, arms wide, in a beaten leather jacket and a skullish t-shirt. We grab barbecue down the street, taking Corys car (the first one hes bought in his 35 years), outfitted with fuzzy seats and new plates that read COPYFYT.
 
Cory hates San Francisco, but loves it here, where he gets to teach classes with names like Pwned: Is everyone on this campus a copyright criminal? The freeway is fast, he says, the light rail usable, the cities surprisingly walkable. Disneyland is close by and there is plenty of 50s kitsch. And its far cheaper living here than in London.
 
Cory is his usual flurry of activity  working on six books, teaching two classes, running one of the most popular blogs, fighting for our digital civil liberties, while still managing to keep up with all the gossip. He hands me an advance proof of a book to read and recommends another hes in the middle of. And on his way out he stands, framed in the doorway, and offers me a piece of advice.
 
You know, he says, Wired really isnt so bad. Its an exciting time in tech industry  the cost of starting a company has fallen drastically  and youre at the center of it. I would have loved to have a job at Wired when I was 18. Wired was very different when you were 18, I say. Yeah, I suppose so, he says. I guess I wouldnt want a job there now  but then again I wouldnt want a job anywhere.
 
And then hes off.
 
As Cory leaves Jeremy Iversen arrives. Iversen is an incredibly odd fellow. With a background in everything from investment banking to neurotheology, he came to my attention with his 2006 book High School Confidential. With a novelists snark and an ethnographers attention to character and institutional detail, he went undercover to a Southern Californian high school for a half a year and wrote the whole thing down with a rare authorial brilliance. (My review.)
 
Now the books out and hes moved on again. This time hes trying to join Hollywood, perhaps play himself in the movie version of the book. He is sleek and abnormally attractive, but I learn this is the result of a spectacularly careful regimen. Every four hours he takes a carefully measured amount of food out of a cryopack in his car, pretty much the only food he is permitted. Then he follows a daily three-page jargon-laden series of instructions from his trainer about which exercises to perform and how at the gym. This, combined with cold reading and audition classes, is now his job.
 
It seems like a waste, but just like danah likes messing with institutions, Jeremy likes trying new things. Ive done a fiction book, Ive done a nonfiction book, Im done with writing, he says. Fair enough; Jeremy amazes me with his many talents. Aside from his good looks, his thoughtful eye, and his talent for writing, hes one of the smarter people Ive spoken to lately, cracking jokes about Yugoslav loyalty and information-theoretic channel errors.
 
He also has amazing interpersonal skills. While danah and Cory bowled me over with their energy, leading me to sit quietly while they braindump news and gossip, Jeremys energy somehow invites my own, leading me to crack jokes and make snarky comments right along with him. Perhaps this guy truly can do anything. Although that only leads to another question: why?
 
I hop in Jeremys car (the very same the kids in his book were in!) and he takes me on a tour of the city. First stop is Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Pier, home to a sewage treatment plant (which lots of signage brags about) and the fortune telling machine that kicked off the plot in Big (I didnt have a quarter to get my fortune, sadly). The crosswalk machines here talk and the stupid shopping mall jobs inspire television pilots. There are large topiary dinosaurs along a promenade with gingerbread houses underneath them to suggest Christmas. (Since the weather doesnt change, the city has to indicate the season in more blatant ways.) There is an entire store dedicated to selling things to geeks, with golden chess pieces mixed in among the lightsabers and Lord of the Rings figurines. The wealthy pretty things stroll back and forth.
 
Meanwhile in Westwood, home of UCLA, we see more shops and Fox Theater, home to many important movie openings. The students sit in cafes, pretending to work but actually checking Flickr, while Jeremy insists I get a tazo milk tea with boba. I do, against my instincts, and, to my surprise, its actually quite good. Then we go back to strolling around LAs imitation of a college town. In most places college towns are kind of a step up from the surrounding environs, but in LA it seems the town is trying to slum down a bit to fit the mold.
 
We head to Beverly Hills, singing the appropriate songs (living in Beverly Hills), and get out to stroll along the famed Rodeo Drive. A giant nude torso inexplicably welcomes us to a strip with shops so upscale that the streetlights have been replaced by chandeliers in glass boxes. Well-dressed women carry their fashionably tiny dogs in Prada bags while trendy young people sit in trendy restaurants, looking vaguely unhappy.
 
Side streets curve off into a world of cobblestone steps even more immaculately clean than the main drag  not a speck of dirt can be found anywhere. And then we find ourselves in the most bizarre three-story mall contraption, with an elevator that goes two floors above any surrounding buildings, three restaurants bathing unhappy people in pink, orange, and green light respectively, closed shops selling pink, orange, and green boxes, and a large glassed-in bedroom suspended literally in the center of it all, with no apparent way to get in. Jeremy was convinced we were in some kind of adventure game  if only we deliver the pink boxes to the people in pink and so on, wed unlock the elevator which would bring us to the key to get into the magic bedroom. But then the polygons stopped rendering so smoothly and we decided to move on, as I begun to wonder if Id stepped into some Virtual Reality simulation.
 
Everything in LA looks so, well, cinematic. I always thought that filmed stuff looked better than my stuff because they used fancy lights, cameras, and lenses to give it that more lushful aesthetic. But apparently all you really need to do is turn your camera on in LA  everything here gives off that hyperreal, oversaturated vibe.
 
And the people are all characters too. When I went down to Venice Beach, I saw attractive women sunbathing on towels while reading scripts. While walking back, I heard a couple guys excited that the casting director had actually called them back this time. The only other people I saw on the street with identifiable occupations (and there are a shocking number of people wandering around the street in the middle of the day with no identifiable occupation) were the immigrant landscapers busily trimming hedges on the houses of their betters.
 
I walked a block too far on the way back and ran into a more dingy neighborhood by a runned-down church. I looked around, trying to get my bearings, and a poor-looking black man on a bicycle with a cup rode up. Sorry, I said, assuming he wanted me to place some money in his cup. Can I help you find anything? he asked. No, I said. Whatre you doing? he asked. Just looking around, I said. Looking for anything in particular? he asked. No, I said. Looking for crack? he asked. No, I said again, and he biked off.
 
Crack is our number one industry, Jeremy says, with entertainment and shipping as our secondary sectors. Apparently the whole city does coke, perhaps the one thing that unites these disparate neighborhoods, this collection of varied enclaves each with their own name and culture that we call Los Angeles. Not all of them, Jeremy explains, are even part of Los Angeles City. Some of them have received special dispensation to carve out their little plot of land and get their own mayor. Santa Monica even elected a Green.
 
We head towards Sunset, stopping to see a large bubbling pit of tar in the middle of the city, right next to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), where even more high society people are standing around looking unhappy, glassed in from the rest of the world  and the tar.
 
We also stop to see the worlds tallest Christmas tree at The Grove shopping mall. Aside from one of the early flagship Apple stores, the Grove also has a trolley to take people around the outdoor mall. Theres little objective need for the trolley  the mall isnt that big  but, as Jeremy says, it just adds to the surreality. To complete the picture, I couldnt resist purchasing a cinnamon sugar pretzel.
 
And then we head to Sunset. There is the Laugh Factory, where Michael Richards recently dealt a large blow to his career. There are trendy clubs and music spots. And there are, of course, billboards; plenty of billboards, advertising this and that as the street curves every which way.
 
Soon things start to calm down and its time for Jeremy to drop me off and hit the gym. We turn around, waving goodbye to all that. And thats LA! he says, as I clutch my chest and feel like my head is about to explode.
 
The afternoon before I have to leave, Im lying on the couch, my headache failing to fade. Time rolls forward and I notice from the orange glow leaking through the window that im gonna miss the sunset yet again. I hop out and run the four blocks to the beach as fast as I can, dodging traffic all the way.
 
When I get there the sun has fallen below the horizon but framed before me is the majestic beach picture Ive always seen in photos. The darkened sand, the glowing water, the crimson orangered strip fading up and to the edges, as if the sun had set directly in front of where Im now facing.
 
I run towards the water and the lights and sounds and people of the city all fall away and I find my self entirely alone with the ocean. The waves run right up to the edge of my toes but dont touch them. I stand, its colors and sounds enveloping my entire field of vision, its scent filling my nostrils. I breathe in deeply.
 
The reflected sunlight before me refracts to form a perfect rainbow, strips of dark red fading into orange fading into yellow then light blue then blue. And for one beautiful moment, before the whole thing fades away into an inky blackness, the colors are laid out perfectly, just the way Ive seen them in prisms and diagrams so many times before, a beautiful sympathy of color. And then my head really does explode, the beauty sending shockwaves through my body.
 
That is how I will remember LA: this beautiful strip of sunset.

Title: The Genius is in the Details
 
As best as we can tell, the human brain works by mastering a specific thing and then giving it a name, wrapping the whole thing up into a bundle and pushing it down a level, so that things can then be built with it as a component. You see this all over the place  its how science works, its how you program, its even how people deal with their friends (lets do the mall again).
 
So it would seem natural to think that smart people would work on a very high level, dealing not in details but in huge abstractions. They would have turned everything into a component, no longer worrying about its details, and built things out of the results.
 
Bizarrely, this seems entirely untrue. The smartest people I know disdain abstractions, preferring to speak in concrete specifics. Take Paul Buchheit, the genius behind Gmail. When he talks about building web applications, he doesnt think about high-level things like the underlying semantic structure of the data  instead he talks about the little heads that read data off of the hard disk and how fast they can move.
 
Another friend, also incredibly bright, doesnt refer to other people that way. He doesnt say oh, hes an expert in X or hes really smart about X; instead he says hes thought a lot about X  breaking down the abstractions of expertise and intelligence into something much more concrete: spending time thinking about something.
 
At first glance these seem like mistakes. Why should a brilliant web app programmer be thinking about hard disk heads? Isnt that something someone else should take care of? And why is my smart friend only concerned with how much time someone has spent on something? Arent there other factors involved?
 
But if you look the other direction, you see the same pattern. Clueless business guys love speaking in big abstractions, talking about information superhighways that act as more efficient content delivery systems that will monetize the genre by disintermediating the legacy players. These guys are speaking exactly as you would expect smart people to  thinking at a high level, working with the big ideas  yet the things they say are so incredibly stupid that they either dont mean anything or mean something thats actually impossible.
 
So whats going on here? As we noted at the beginning, the brain works by mastering the details and then giving them a name. But the business guys took the easy way out: they just mastered the names. If you asked them exactly how a content delivery system worked, they wouldnt be able to tell you. They know only the high-level thing, with none of the details.
 
And its the details that make it so interesting  and so powerful. Anyone can master the names of big concepts and combine them like so many puzzle pieces; its knowing how they work that takes time. And the smart people have made that investment. So perhaps its just natural that they want to stay it a little closer to it than most.

I fully agree, and this leads me to a question. We already have many people in school well into their 30s, thinking a lot about these layers, building and connecting their understanding from the ground up. And I expect that we wont have fewer abstraction layers in the future; we will have more. What happens when one cannot learn in a single lifetime all of the layers needed to develop, much less answer, the futures important questions? Will specialization doom the most important kinds of understanding?

My personal view is that one should never use an abstraction until ones understand how an abstraction works.  Once you know how it works, however, feel free to abstract away.
 
Using an abstraction without knowing what it is youre abstracting makes about as much sense to me as using a word without knowing what it means, without having a luciferous logolepsy.

Youre on to something here but perhaps shouldnt read too much into the anecdotes.
 
Its not true that mastery of details always precedes names. Lots of things are given working titles before they are well-defined or observed. Thats why so many things have odd/misleading names. For example, imaginary number, subatomic particle, positron, Planet X, or even computer science.
 
But smart folk do seem to be able to explain Big Ideas with concrete analogies. Finding the least & most robust analogy to work with is a large part of problem solving.

Its certainly true that many of the smartest people out there think primarily in terms of details, discrete and concrete elements, I dont think one must conclude that there are either fewer smart people who deal primarily in abstraction or that people who deal in detail are necessarily smarter. I think the two ways of thinking suggest a difference in personality, and perhaps a different type of intelligence.
 
I have a question, also, about the latter friends remark. One can be an expert in something without necessarily having spent time thinking about it. Saying that someone has thought about X suggests to me not that the person is an expert or adept, but that their understanding is deep rather than surface, considered rather than facile. Thoughtful. A capable writer may use punctuation with precision, but this does not mean she has thought about punctuation beyond having it drilled into her head at an early age.
 
In a general sense, I dont think that abstraction is the enemy of clarity or intelligence, its just that most people, because they deal primarily in the concrete, are more easily duped by abstraction than detail. Its easier to lie or bulls**t with abstraction.

Abstraction is a form of data compression: absolutely necessary, because human short-term memory is so small, but the critically important aspect of abstraction is the algorithm that gets you from the name back to the uncompressed details.
 
An uncompressed bitmap is a picture, where every pixel is individually specified; bitmap graphics tend to be very, very large.  A vector graphic is a set of equations, that tell a display program how to draw a picture; vector graphics are typically very small.
 
If someone were to ask, What caused the American Civil War?  I could answer, in a word, slavery and I would be right.  But, if you were to unpack that answer to mean that people opposed to slavery went to war to abolish it, you would be wrong.  Learning the history of the American Civil War is learning to unpack that answer in a way, which is consistent with the historical record.  The actual historical record is vastly too voluminous to comprehend, and that record is only a tiny fractional detritus of the life experiences of literally millions and millions of people.  History is coming up with a narrative analysis that can pack up that huge volume of data in a way that doesnt do obvious violence to what a reasonable person might infer was the substance of actual experience.  When you learn history, you learn a narrative analysis that does that work of compression, that packing up.  So, if you learn the history of the American Civil War, you learn about the anxieties and aggression of the slaveholders, and the controversies occasioned by western expansion, and the dynamics of political struggle and economic development that led the slaveholders to start a war to defend slavery.

The phrase we used to use was keyword driven.  Managers who didnt have a clue as to the details would master the key words and so sound smart. The problem comes when they then start to agree to do things that the key words imply are easy, but the details say are very hard.

I dont know that all the marketing guys are so stupid.  I used to think that way until I realized that they didnt give a lick about technical knowledge, never did, and probably never will.  What theyre usually concerned with is selling emotionally.  Specifically conditioning a persons hormonal response to put them in an advantageous business situation.
 
I mean, blind luck can only carry you so far in any endeavor.  If its not some sort of skill or capacity that these people we disdain possess, then they would not be in positions of such power.
 
That said, and more on point with the topic of the entry, I believe that the benefit of not using abstractions is being able to see where a problem will occur or where an advantage can be derived from that you cant see when the abstraction strips the texture out of a problem.  Still, abstraction is absolutely, vitally necessary to solving complex problems and to making decisions.
 
Though your friend may think about the throughput of his hard drives platter at the outside of the disk as compared to the inside, I doubt hes considering the electromagnetic forces used to read and write each of the individual bits stored.  Nor would I think hes considering the kinetic forces against the arm that moves the head from the inside to the outside, nor a universe of other things.
 
More so, I doubt he was thinking (deeply, in any case) about the drive heads when he was making the brilliant decision to have Gmail force conversations to be displayed as threads (seriously, if you can thank him about that for me, Id appreciate it).
 
I agree with the general notion though.

Its all about the interaction between abstract ideas and details. Being able to work on several levels of abstraction thinking about the same problem is a very useful skill to have.
 
Its easy to obscure the message by hiding it all behind meaningless abstractions but theres a difference between thinking about the information superhighway (totally useless abstraction) and the write_to_file function (useful abstraction) and the individual pieces of the hardware (in most cases useless details). When youre working on an email application, you want to be thinking primarily about inboxes and emails and not individual heads on a hard disk.
 
The interaction between the abstraction and the details, the small and the big picture are almost always the most interesting. For instance, in physics, general relativity describes the mechanics of very large objects, such as stars, planets and galaxies. Quantum mechanics describes the mechanics of the very small, such as subatomic particles. Being to unify those two, the details and the larger picture is the holy grail of physics. Nobodys been able to do it yet.

Good points.  The comment about abstractions being akin to data compression was also interesting to read.
 
One thing about abstractions is that theyre (by their abstract definition) not trustworthy.  The reason buzzwords are so hated is mainly because theyre used to justify wildly different things.  Its the lack of specificity that causes engineers to shy away.
 
Its true that humans learn by mastering a specific thing and then giving it a name.  But smart humans also spend a lot of time seeing whether that name can be applied to other things as well (fitting the abstraction to other situations).  Really smart humans spend a lot of time swapping out bits and pieces of what makes up the abstraction (as best they can tell), trying to get an idea of how the bits interact to give the observed result.
 
Thats a pretty good definition of learning ability - the ability to change focus from the abstract to detailed and back.
 
I suspect that a lot of what looks like detail obsession by genius-level folks is in fact one of two other things: (1) Paying attention to things that arent actually details - just smaller abstractions.  (2) Paying attention important details - things that have been found (from experience) to be significant factors in other abstractions.  The kind of small things that, if they changed just a slight bit, would have huge impacts elsewhere.
 
Slight tangent - Warren Buffets annual shareholder letters are some stellar examples of a genius working with many levels of focus.

Title: Drop Out
 
I was wondering what I was going to find for todays Sunday Bonus Post. Luckily, at the last minute, the San Francisco Chronicle stepped in to save me:
 
Aaron Swartz dropped out of high school after one year to study on his own. Then he dropped out of college after one year to seek his high-tech fortune. He was still in his teens a year later when he hit the jackpot, selling his startup in October to Wired Digital for an undisclosed but lottery-like payout.
 
With his boyish mien and more geek credentials than engineers twice his age, the suddenly wealthy Swartz belongs to a new generation of young, brainy geeks who began booting up and logging on when their friends were still watching Sesame Street. Before they were old enough to drive, they landed paying gigs. Now that another high-tech boom is heating up Silicon Valley, more of these technologically developed but underage techies are dropping out and starting up.
 
[]
 
Everything that would get you detention at school will get you funding in Silicon Valley, said Paul Saffo, a valley forecaster and essayist who has been exploring technological change and its impact on business and society for more than two decades.
 
[]
 
Fancy new car? I dont know how to drive, Swartz wrote on his blog, Raw Thought. Big house in the suburbs? I like living in small apartments. Expensive clothes? Ive worn a T-shirt and jeans practically every day of my life. Hanging with the cool kids? Im so shy I dont even hang out with the people I know now.

Title: Never Back to School
 
When guests came to visit us at Stanford, theyd always comment on the
beauty of our campus  the copious greenery, the modern decorations,
the classic architecture. I used to take them at their word. I always
thought Stanford was a very pretty campus. Now I realize that it was
merely bright.
 
Coming back to Stanford after living in San Francisco is an odd
experience, because the place seems so obviously much more fake. You
dont notice when youre in it, but Stanford is a real wonder of a
bubble. Surrounded by a moat of trees, it pretends to be its own
self-sufficient city, complete with its own name (Stanford, California
is not technically a city, but only a census-designated place; it has
its own zip code, nonetheless). It has its own food, housing, public
transit system, gas station (this is California), police force, job
openings, newspaper, and events calendar. Most large universities have
such things, of course, but they mesh with and supplement the outside
world. At Stanford, despite being in the center of Silicon Valley, youd
hardly know the outside world existed.
 
Everything here is immaculately clean. There is rarely weather, just
constant sun from a cloudless sky (the sky kindly rains only at night so
as not to disturb anyone). There are no outsiders, just scrupulously
examined teachers, carefully selected students, and well-behaved
maintenance staff (who are not paid a living wage, despitee the
proteests of generous-minded students).
 
Coming back to Stanford, wandering its august halls once again, it feels
so strange. I lived here for a full year; this should feel like coming
home. But while I recognize it all  not much changed while I was gone
 it doesnt feel like home at all. Everything seems, well, smaller.
 
Part of that, obviously, is literally true: Im physically bigger now,
so things seem smaller in comparison. But it also feels psychologically
smaller, like after living in San Francisco I can no longer accept this
simulated city as a reality. Instead, Im constantly seeing it in its
context in the wider world.
 
The result is that everything feels like a bizarre show, played out on
this phony stage. Beautiful guys in pajamas, talking to beautiful girls
in less. Party music blaring. Kids scooting elegantly by on bicycles.
Before I just thought this was the strange reality of the world I was
dropped into. Now I see it as just another act.
 
I went to the top of the large tower in the middle of the Stanford
campus, something Id never found the time to do while I was a student.
And looking out, the school splayed before me, I noticed something odd.
The beaultiful Stanford buildings, so varied and complex at ground
level, all look like big red rectangles from the sky. Perhaps Stanford
is one of those things you really have to be in to genuinely see.

Title: Two Conceptions of Taste
 
Taste is difficult to define and even harder to justify, so let us just take it for granted for a moment. (Alright, for those who dont get the picture, heres a quick attempt: taste is the ability to create elegance. The people who made the iPod clearly have taste; the people who made Windows do not.) Unfortunately for me, it seems like a lot of people in the US dont have much taste. (Try watching the infographics on the network evening news, for example.) But even among people who have taste, Ive noticed there are two kinds: positive and negative.
 
Negative taste is the ability to tell when something is bad. Positive taste is the ability to make something that is good. Indeed, one might even say that there is only one kind of taste and positive taste is simply negative taste plus skills. But since taste is generally inferred from creations, its probably simpler to treat them as two different things.
 
People with negative taste can make things that look really nice, but they also look very plain. I think the founders of Google have negative taste. John Gruber, as far as I can tell, mostly does. Same with Paul Graham. (As do I, for that matter.) People with negative taste make things by trying something very simple and then stripping away pieces until it looks good. They can detect goodness, but not create it, so theyre limited to designs with very few variables, because then they can go thru all the options and pick out the ones that look OK.
 
People with positive taste, on the other hand, can make things that genuinely look good. This gives them a lot more freedom in their designs (they can use colors other than white!). Truly good designers have positive taste. Unfortunately for people like us, Apple seems to have hired most of them and put them to work building fairly bland web sites.
 
Of course, taste applies to far more fields than design. One could apply the same idea to writing. Positive taste writers can write beautiful flowing prose that looks you in. Negative taste writers can only write beautiful things by staying simple.
 
People with negative taste can recognize people with positive taste and hire them. People with no taste, on the other hand, fail to see the difference, resulting in disasters like the graphic design department of American Airlines.
 
People with negative taste can also be critics, which brings us to Joe Clarks famous comment Actually, no, it is not the responsibility of the critic to solve the problem. Pauline Kael was not expected to rewrite and redirect the films she disliked.
 
People with negative taste can pick out the bad movies. They just cant make great ones.

By your definitions, I think I have negative taste, but I wonder if what youre calling positive taste isnt just people with negative taste who experiment more. If you rule out enough bad things, what youre left with is very likely to be good, right?
 
That some countries (e.g. Japan) seem to collectively have better taste than others (e.g. America) suggests to me that most people just repeat what theyve experienced, and only a few care enough to strip away whats bad after that (what youre calling negative taste), and fewer still care enough to add more and strip away again (what youre calling positive taste).

You might be oversimplifying things by assuming that negative and positive taste fall on the same axis.  From the way you describe each quality, they sound rather orthogonal.  As you say, people with negative taste can discern the negative as well as the positive qualities of a design.  This sounds independent from your description of positive taste: the ability to create precisely pleasing designs.
 
Perhaps negative taste could itself define the ability to discern the pleasant designs from the poor, and positive taste could define the potential to create such works.  In the same way that a chemist requires accuracy and precision, a great designer requires great amounts of discerning taste and creative taste.

BRi,
 
No, they certainly are not orthogonal.  You need negative taste before you can have positive taste.  But to some extent, I think you need a bit of positive taste before you can have negative taste as well.  You need to really think deeply about a subject to come to a good enough understanding to criticize it well, and by far the easiest way to come to such and understanding is through your own practice.
 
Additionally, taste is definitely like a deeply branching tree.  Even within a genre, there are many different styles, which appeal to different tastes differently.  These tastes can be refined in different ways, and, for instance, some art is only appealing when very closely scrutinized, with a deep understanding of the artists motivations, while other art is pleasing to the unpracticed eye.  Both require just as much care on the part of the artist to execute, but consideration of audience is a key part of such positive taste.

Title: Lazy Backup
 
If theres one thing good UI designers know, its that the best UI is not to have one at all. Applications should just save, security should just work, and computers should just backup.
 
Apparently that last task is a harder than it appears, since I still havent found decent backup software for Unix (OS X and GNU/Linux).
 
Here is how the software should work:
 
I install it.
 
I point it at some storage server (ideally Amazon EC2 and S3, but if thats too hard then a GNU/Linux server with a large drive).
 
I give it a maximum space limit (e.g. store no more than 200GB).
 
I give it a maximum up-bandwidth limit (e.g. use no more than 5K/s).
 
I tell it to run.
 
From then on, it should just work. In the background, it will upload my files to the server using only 5K/s of bandwidth. If I get disconnected from the Internet or reboot my computer, when I get back on it will pick up where it left off. If a file changes it will only send the diff and store that as well. When I run out of disk space it will delete the old diffs.
 
It will preserve all the Unix ACLs and permissions and weird Mac OS X resource forks and stuff so that if my drive ever dies I can make a full bootable restore from the backup.
 
Does this software exist?
 
The closest Ive seen is rdiff-backup, which is very nice but fails to automate some key steps.
 
If it doesnt exist, let me know if youre interested in writing it (a wrapper around rdiff-backup to do it shouldnt be too hard, I would think). Id be willing to offer a bounty.
 
You should follow me on twitter here.

rsync can do pretty much everything you ask for (although Im not sure if it can handle the MacOS stuff unless its stored in a regular file).  I have a setup where everything you mention is in place except for the bandwidth and disk space limitations (okay, it uses rsync over ssh and cron to schedule the jobs).  rsync does support a bandwidth limit option, and with du, another cron job can go through and clear out old backups.

Are you looking for something that will upload your files as you save them, or using a nightly cron or similar?

On my last machine, I used rsnapshot. It makes incremental backups, and handles scheduling for you, which is nice. Also, you dont need any special tools to restore the backups.
 
But I have just switched to a macbook. As it happens, my new backup drives arrived in the mail this very afternoon. I think Ill give rdiff-backup a try.
 
Anyways, Im pretty interested in your bounty. I wonder if I can find the time. Itd be great if you provided more details about what exactly you wanted.

You may wish to consider pull backups  where the backup server periodically connects to the source and downloads the data for backup, rather than the client explicitly uploading.
 
Otherwise, if the client has read/write access to the backup medium, an attacker, worm or user/software error on your machine would be able to damage or tamper with your backups.
 
The ideal solution that Ive been thinking about is a backup appliance  a simple unattended machine that will periodically connect to my primary data store(s) and take an incremental snapshot, ideally via rsync-over-SSH.
 
It shouldnt be too hard  Linksys NSLU2 devices already seem to provide most of my desired functionality, with configuration via HTTP and support for backing up SMB shares.  (Theyre embedded Linux machines, and can be reinstalled with more general-purpose firmware, eg from http://www.nslu2-linux.org/)
 
Multiple backup appliance instances could be deployed (in different physical locations) for added redundancy.
 
In the case of a laptop as the source, one issue would be host discovery and connectivity - if the laptop is on a non-routable IP address or inbound port 22 connections arent available (which is common), then the backup appliances may have problems connecting.  Some kind of backwards SSH tunnelling would probably solve this problem.
 
Similarly, bandwidth on the client may vary  some mechanism to moderate the bandwidth used by the backup appliances from the client-side would be desirable.
 
But I havent built it yet.

I personaly use it on a local volume since it can handle incremental backups quite well using hard links.
 
As for the space limit problem, there is no good solution, but you always can delete older backups in a cron job.

You MUST, AND I MEAN MUST use incremental backups. Having just one copy is completely useless as a corrupted file is gone forever. Likewise for an accidentally deleted one, when you discover the problem after a backup.
 
Use a linux based solution that can do it via hard-links. This means you can cd into each directory and see a copy of the full set, without  it taking up lots of space for the same data. For this reason I have been using RIBS (RSync Incremental Backups) for several years now. I have a copy of my home directory available going back three years or so.
 
It doesnt have a GUI, but you do need to edit the script to set the directory to backup, and the host to SSH to in order to do the backup. Not complicated. Oh, and you need to set up cron to perform backups.
 
It will pickup from where it left off if disturbed, and it will also only transfer over the changes. I use it to backup a 120gig primary storage area every single night, consisting of files averaging from a few kilobytes up to several hundred meg.

A general purpose bandwidth limiter would make an interesting general application / utility.  So many apps need network connectivity, Im imagining a tool that would let me define up/down limits for specific applications and forget about it.  At home were on dialup and winXP, being able to limit everything but firefox (i.e. keep all the auto update checkers from getting in the way) would be huge.
 
Reading the trickle paper makes it sound like a general solution would be non-trivial.  It may be easier to make something like a modified firewall and send the backup out over a specific port every time.
 
Im interested to hear what you come up with.

Of course, thats the downside, since you cant really just let it run and forget about it since you have to manually deal with merge conflicts (pretty rare in practice). You might be able to set up a cron job and have it skip conflicts, I havent tried that.

It creates a .dmg file on a mounted network drive and backs up to the .dmg file.
 
Im unaware of any cross platform backup tool that will backup OS X files 100% correctly.

Its a commercial app in beta, but this app is a set and forget app that only copies the changed bytes (similar to Rsync) and encrypts the data on your machine before uploading it.  I have an interested in this, so I am certainly not impartial:
 
www.vionobackup.com
 
On another note though, I have used Rsync for a long time on the Mac. Its a great tool. My only issue was that my data was not encrypted at the server end, so thats why we decided to write our own. Its only in beta and available for Mac and Windows, so appreciate any feedback

Try looking at ZFS:
 
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/
 
ZFS backup and restore are powered by snapshots. Any snapshot can generate a full backup, and any pair of snapshots can generate an incremental backup. Incremental backups are so efficient that they can be used for remote replication  e.g. to transmit an incremental update every 10 seconds.
 
Snapshots are just one of many nice features ZFS offers.  That said, itd take some serious work to get it working on your Mac, assuming its possible at all.
 
However, you may just have to wait a while, as it might appear in Apples next OS release:

+1 for rsnapshot. One additional thing I didnt see mentioned is that Mac OS Xs default rsync binary  (which would be doing the gruntwork for rsnapshot) takes a -E flag to properly capture resource forks and other extended attributes of HFS.

Aaron,
 
Its commercial software, but Storage Exec from Veritas/Symantec does file level replication between a source and target share/file system.  It can throttle CPU and bandwidth utilization.
 
BackupExec with Continuouse Data Protection has a similar functionality, with an agent.
 
Your data is most important, but the ability to perform a fast, reliable recovery of a system is critical for business use.  For this purpose, I bought Acronis when my daughter went to college with her laptop.  It creates a boot CD (linux based) that allows network and USB connections to restore an image to the machine.  Backup rates are ~1 Gig/min for USB 2.  Restores are a bit longer, but they are 100% reliable.
 
Echoing a theme from previous posts, Acronis supports an incremental backup feature and you can schedule using the Acronis scheduler.

Try Bacula.  I am using it to back up several Linux and Windows servers on our LAN and its perfect.  It does everything you are asking for and more.  I pretty much forget about it until I rm -rf * in the wrong directory, and then it restores it easy as can be.  It has a director on one (Linux) machine and you schedule it to connect to the other machines and do incremental backups onto another storage machine or backup device.  It is very flexible and reliable.

Another thing thats tricky about setting up backups is getting the includes and excludes just right. Dont want to leave anything out (Ive done it; obscure non-home-dir file that I really needed), but dont want to waste space on, say, iMovies included themes.
 
It would be great if somebody published a ready-made black/whitelist for Mac OS X, or maybe even a script that examined your system and wrote one.

Christian R. Simms,
 
I had the idea  to use svn to do incremental backups to, but I hit some walls pretty fast.
 
1 - its quite slow with binaries
2 - you will have big time fun with permissions
3 - svn puts a .svn folder in every folders
 
except  for those 3 points, it could make a decent backup system.

Update: rdiff-backup (1) has no pretend mode, (2) is ludicrously slow on small files, and the real showstopper, (3) doesnt work over mounted network volumes  but doesnt tell you that until its finished its backup, only to leave it in an inconsistent and unusable state after all those hours.

Ive used Amanda (http://www.amanda.org/) with sucesss, it uses (as much as possible) the clients command line tools, there is no GUI but it gives you nightly email reports if you want. Stages backups to a local hard drive before comiting them, so there is some automatic fall-back in case your backup device isnt there.
 
I havent used it to backup to hard drives, but it does seem to understand bandwith, backup windows, priority by machine and by partition, etc.
 
I dont know if it does everything you want, but I have similar feelings about software and it works for me.

So this is what Ive come up with: rdiff-backup, besides being a shady and un-feel-good program, doesnt handle lots of small files, at all. So Im making a disk image with superduper, and then incrementing the image with rdiff-backup. Well see how it goes. Superduper is super-slow, and also shareware, so itd be cool if somebody knew of a similar program that works better or is free. Its a front-end for ditto(1) from what I understand.

Im surprised nobody has mentioned backuppc (http://backuppc.sourceforge.net). It pulls backups down through the network, does incremental backups, and even pools files across PCs, so that only one copy of any given file is stored in the backup. I have it backing up 9 Linux boxes right now, 434 GB of backups being stored on a 120GB RAID 1 array, with 14 GB available
 
Nice web interface for restoring backups, automatic notification mails if its unable to do a backup for an extended period of time, only backs up machines after work hours if theyre constantly onlinebut if theyre not, will pick up where it left off as soon as it sees a machine that has been offline
 
It copies using Rsync or Samba, so itll backup Windows, too, if you need it to I have it running on a 10 year old dual 500MHz server that cant really be used for anything else
 
Havent figured out how to cap its size/bandwidth, but I find it incredibly easy to (not) use, and have even used it to restore files for clients with a few clicks
 
Cheers,
John

CrashPlan might come close to what youre looking for (Mac OS X). You point it to a server, give it an amount of bandwidth to use, and tell it to go, and it backs up most recent changes first and then the rest of your stuff. When files change, it does a diff and only backs up the bytes that have changed, since bandwidth is a bottleneck. Heres a review at TidBITS:

Im currently looking into backup programs as I want to backup a Mac and a Windows laptop to an NSLU2 running Debian Linux.
 
Boxbackup sounds like it does what you want (although Im not sure about the bandwidth limiting). It claims to support Mac OS resource forks, although Ive not tried this yet. A <a href=http://blog.plasticsfuture.org/2006/04/23/mac-backup-software-harmful/>blog post on Mac backups
 
rdiff-backup was horribly slow for me: it took about an hour for an incremental backup to decide to do more or less nothing. Im not sure whether thats because the NSLU2 is slow and the comparisons are being done on the server side, or what. Im going to look into Bacula and Boxbackup when I get a moment. Bacula isnt the sort of lazy backup you talk of, but seems to be well maintained and used by serious sysadmins, so Im inclined to trust it over the various rsync based scripts which are out there.

Title: A Trip to the Courthouse: Part 2
 
continued from part 1
 
For a hundred and eighty-six years America had an opt-in system of copyright, Lessig began. Copyright was not granted automatically but was limited to works that were published. And then only to those with notice. And then only to those published with notice that were deposited and registered promptly. And to those [published,] marked, deposited, and registered, the copyright still had to be renewed after 28 years. Under this system, nearly fifty percent of published work entered the public domain immediately and ninety-three percent within twenty-eight years.
 
Following the 1976 Copyright Act, that all changed and copyright was granted automatically, for a full term, as soon as a work was fixed in a tangible form. No longer was it necessary to published, deposit, mark, or renew. Copyright moved from an opt-in system to an opt-out. And under this system, zero percent of published work will enter the public domain for at least a hundred years.
 
This is a radical change  perhaps the most radical change  to copyright law, going from ninety-three percent of works going in the public domain to zero. And the result is a huge increase in orphaned works  works whose copyright holder cannot even be located to ask permission.
 
In Eldred v. Ashcroft, the Supreme Court ruled that copyright only needed judicial review when the traditional contours of copyright law were changed. This is clearly a change to copyrights traditional contours and thus deserves a chance for judicial review.
 
The governments lawyer  slick, but not as slick as Lessig  argued that the Court was referring to only two traditional contours: the right to fair use (which allows things like the use of small snippets of copyrighted material and limited copies for educational use) and the idea/expression dichotomy (which says that you cant copyright ideas but only a particular way of expressing them).
 
Lessig responded that this was absurd. If the government ruled that cartoons featuring the prophet Mohammed could not receive copyrights, the law would clearly be subject to First Amendment review, even though neither fair use nor idea/expression were touched. Similarly, the change from opt-out to opt-in deserves review.
 
There were three judges, as required by law to hear all federal appeals. The one on the right, who was live via satellite, didnt say a word the entire time. The one on the left didnt ask more than a question or two. The judge in the middle was responsible for most of the questions. And she did not appear to get it.
 
How is this different from Eldred? she asked.
 
A quarter of the way in to the argument, she handed a slip of paper to her aide. Her aide scurried away and came back with a thick document. She looked down at it and then looked up.
 
You were the lawyer in Eldred as well, she asked Lessig.
 
Yes, your honor.
 
How is this different from Eldred?
 
In Eldred, Lessig explained, trying again, the issue was whether Congress could continue expanding the length of copyright in order to keep Mickey Mouse from going into the public domain. The Court  Justice Ginsburg channelling Justice Scalia  said that since Congress had been doing this forever they could keep doing it. But in this case, were talking about a new change, one that effects orphaned works  works for who the copyright holder cannot be located.
 
Which wouldnt include Mickey Mouse, because every can find Disney? the judge asked.
 
Precisely, Lessig replied.
 
During the governments rebuttal, the judge asked who was lobbying against this change in copyright law. Well, the governments lawyer replied, um, I suspect it was people very much like the ones you see here today. (Yeah, Lessig scoffed later, I was testifying in Congress against the bill back when I was fifteen!)
 
By the same token, the judge asked Lessig about what solutions to the problem he would expect were the law ruled unconstitutional. There are many possible solutions, Lessig replied, drawing a picture of a network of people fighting this issue in all branches of government. There was this lawsuit, of course, but there was also a bill introduced by local Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren to require a one-dollar renewal fee (based, Lessig did not say, on a New York Times op-ed he had written), there was a series of hearings by the U.S. Copyright Office on the orphaned works problem, which concluded The orphan works problem is real.  Legislation is necessary to provide a meaningful solution to the orphan works problem as we know it today. and provided several proposals.
 
Your time is up, the judge said, before the red light saying his time was up had gone on, and Lessig quietly packed up his papers and filed out, half the courtroom following behind him.
 
Congratulations, Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle (the man who Lessig is filing this lawsuit on behalf of) said to Lessig, shaking his hand and smiling broadly. Lessig smiled back, then posed politely for photos with Kahle and his associate Rick Prelinger. The well-wishers soon streamed out until it was just Lessig and his fellow law school lawyers. The smile disappeared from Lessigs face. They didnt get it, Lessig said downcast.
 
Oh, I think they were getting it towards the end there, one of the lawyers said, trying to cheer Lessig up. No, he replied, they werent. Well, another lawyer chimed in, to write an opinion theyll have to read the briefs and then theyll see your argument. No, he explained, they can just tell a clerk which way to write the opinion and have them do it.
 
Actually, our best hope now is that they wont write an opinion at all and then Golan [a related case in a different Circuit] will go the other way and then well have a circuit split. (A circuit split is when two different circuit courts rule different ways on the same issue. Usually the Supreme Court then has to step in to resolve the disagreement.)
 
Well, at least your case didnt have any flamethrowers, someone said, trying to lighten the mood. But Lessig just wasnt in the mood.

I am amazed at the level of misunderstanding/lack of interest at the US Court of Appeals level.  You would think that judges of this nature, when their job is to prepare for oral arguments and to have their questions answered, would be able to properly prepare for such a case.  I mean they have the whole time to simply ask him questions about what hes getting at and why the case should be decided in his favor.
 
Im sure he knew they didnt get it two minutes into his argument when they werent asking him questions.

====================================================
Date: November 27, 2006
 
Title: A Trip to the Courthouse: Part 1
 
The United State Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is a federal-looking building nestled in among the offices and shops and business parks of San Franciscos downtown. Large marble walls and staircases try desperately to send the message that what goes on here is of paramount importance, that the decisions made in these halls will reverberate throughout a large part of the country: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington  the largest of any appeals court.
 
But, this morning, the courtroom tells a different story. With people packed like Sardines into a room not much bigger than a bedroom in a San Francisco apartment, with one of the judges missing and replaced  without explanation  with a large television, and with hesitant, stammering public defenders arguing their cases against only slightly-less-hesitant civil servants, I briefly wondered if I was in the wrong room.
 
The first case I saw appeared to be a man requesting asylum in the US from his home country. I missed large portions of the case, but as I paid attention, the facts started coming out. He wanted asylum from persecution because he was gay. But the country he was hiding from didnt exactly have a record of persecution of gays. And the only evidence of persecution he could point to was that a couple people on the street once called him gay.
 
The next case seemed a little better for the non-government guy. It was about a man who accused of defrauding Medicare by double-billing. He noted that the Court had changed the law during the case; instead of just requiring the jury to find whether double-billing had occurred, it now required the jury to find how much. But theyd made that change after the trial, so hed never had a chance to present any evidence on how much double-billing had occurred. His lawyer asked for a chance to hold a hearing to present the evidence.
 
Do you have the evidence? a judge asked. The lawyer responded that he didnt, because he was a public defender and needed to hire a professional accountant to look through the math, but couldnt afford to without a judges permission, and the judge denied his request at the same time he denied the hearing on the subject. But, he explained, the governments accountant had admitted on the stand that there were mistakes in the math he presented, although he didnt know what impact they had. Couldnt he just get a trial to assess the math? The judges didnt seem to think so.
 
If the judges werent going to give a victory on that case, they really werent on the next one. A man who lived with his mom in Massachusetts was challenging the governments search of his storage locker in Arizona. His lawyer sparred with the judges for some time about the details of Fourth Amendment law. Then the governments lawyer took the stage. Let me tell you about this man, he said. As a condition of his parole, he wasnt permitted to have any guns. But he kept one gun, the machine gun hed had since he was a kid  he called it his baby. The government got a tip and showed up on his doorstep and he practically handed them the gun and then told them to go away. It was raining outside and he wouldnt let them into his house. They searched the house and found another machine gun kit.
 
In Court, he was asked if he had any more guns. His lawyer, acting on his clients behalf, insisted that the Court didnt have jurisdiction because all the other guns were in a storage locker in Arizona. After the lawyer said that, we had to search the locker in Arizona. There we found a huge shipping crate. To take the crate into evidence, the government had to inventory it. There we found 44 flamethrowers, 22 submachine guns, 5 hand grenades, and a handful of pistols. We had to call in the bomb squad and check over everything. And hes arguing that the Fourth Amendment doesnt permit us to open that crate.
 
Later, I heard some of the lawyers on a different case joking. Once opposing counsel says flamethrowers, youve lost. Doesnt matter how good your case is. Youre never going to recover from that.
 
It was into this environment that Larry Lessig stepped. Lessig has been thinking about the implications of copyright law for most of his career. He has spent months practicing to argue before the Supreme Court and other lesser courts. He spent the weekend practicing this case with other faculty members at the Stanford Law School. He spent the morning pacing the halls, going over his notes one last time. And as he strode into the Courtroom that morning and begun his argument before the Court, unlike every other lawyer who had presented, he didnt stumble over a single word.
 
In some ways, this should have been home territory for Lessig. It was his own Court, right in his own town of San Francisco. And as he paced the halls, he was continually interrupted by former students of his at Stanford Law, who had gone on to careers as lawyers in the area, which had brought them here, to argue before the Court just like him. And, perhaps he figured, the judges would welcome a break from the endless parade of petty complaints to his arguments about the big issues  the First Amendment, the Progress clause, copyright. Werent things like that why they became judges in the first place?
 
Perhaps not.

Title: Pay it Forward
 
A year or two ago, I suffered from a devastating server crash. The little heads that read data off the hard drive crashed into the driv itself, and as we rebooted the computer, trying to get it working again, they scratched the hard drive so badly that when we sent it to try to get it repaired we learned  they had scraped the drive straight through.
 
My site was dead, my backups werent working, an entire year of my work had been lost and I was devastated. A bunch of generous souls chipped in an amazing $4000 to my server fund to try to bring things back.
 
Now that Im back on my feet, Id like tor eturn the favor by donating $4000 to websites in trouble. (Indeed, Ive been planning this for a while and have already donated some to sites when I heard they were having fundraising drives.) 
So heres this weeks Sunday Bonus Post: suggest a site that deserves a donation. Here are the rules:
 
The site must publish content or provide a service on the Internet.
 
The site must have a donate button or some other explicit request for donations.
 
You must genuinely like the site.
 
If you want to nominate a site that meets these criteria, post it here in a comment. Ill try to make most of the donations by next week.

I agree with the idea. But I think you can do most or more by making backup.reddit (where people talk about backup issues - history and solutions) - subreddit site, so that now this widespread PC and digital equipment use among not that informed or ready populations all over the planet gets some - reasonable helps and guides.
 
That subreddit can have a policy of (comfortably) accepting peoples own writings and ideas about backup (and may be some security) issues. It can encompass issues like Why we still cant disable Dont save button? for some sloppy people or with disabilities. OLPC would have backup solutions for those kids personal unique data? How Amazon S3s backup potential can be a start of real infra for off-premise backups for personal computation, finally?. etc.
 
Thatd have some lasting effect and results.

Theyre a serious outfit doing the type of news that many of us on the left consider important, while still setting a standard for reporting that even corporate news sites should aspire to. They report mostly on topics that corporate media would never touch. Ive been a fan since they began running reports from the ground in Iraq from the excellent correspondent, Dahr Jamail, at the start of the war when virtually all journalists were embedded within the military or otherwise confined to safe areas. I also enjoy their coverage of worker rights issues and the environment. For those of us who hope for a world with more reputable, independent media organizations, this looks to be one of the best sites to root for.

Trying to get rid of the censorship which is common in Nepal. Prameya, the site owner, is a friend of mine, and has a dream he really wants to accomplish; to have his website noticed all over Nepal. He started his project when he was still living in Nepal, which was called Merosansar. After he received a death threat from the king of Nepal (Yes, really! Hes a dictator, you might have heard about revolts in Nepal on the news not that long ago), he was forced to close his site and moved to New York with his family where hes now a student at Syracuse University. So, a few months ago, he started his site again under a new name, CJNepal. Also, Prameya needs to pay for his server, for advertising, hiring Nepali people whod like to write articles for the site, etc. No wonder hes currently in debt, so any money would really help him out I guess. If you would ever feel like donating to CJNepal, you can find a donate button on the About page here: http://cjnepal.org/node/78
Also, would you mind including my name (Laurent) on the additional Note form when donating (if you ever would), just because Id like to thank him for all the things he has done for me.

Hello Aaron,
I would like to nominate to you Modest Needs at http://www.modestneeds.org - for your plan to pay it forward the help you received. Modest Needs is a non-profit organization who helps people with a one time need such as a mother whose husband has left her with all the bills and her electricity is about to be turned off; or someone who was affected by Hurricane Katrina and needs money to buy more lumber or other supplies to help re-build their home. You can browse the applications the site receives from people asking for help and see the struggles each person is facing and requesting a little help. Modest Needs has been helping people for over 5 years, I believe, with modest requests. The President of Modest Needs who began the program with his own money will be on the Today Show Saturday Morning, November 18, 2006 talking about how the program works. Donors from all over the world give contributions, either every month or on a one-time basis. These funds are then used to give away to the neediest of people applying. They do thorough checks to verify all information submitted to them by the people requesting help through their site, and it has been heartwarming for me to be a donor with this organization. Most donations, like mine of usually $30 per month, doesnt make a huge difference, but when many people get together and give $5, $10, $30 or even $4,000, it makes a huge difference in many peoples lives.
 
It cost nothing to register at their site. I hope you will take a look and see the amazing things going on there when people like me and many others get together and pay it forward. Im not one of the administrators of the program, only a donor who believes in what they are doing. I think you will find many awesome stories of help given demonstrated through Modest Needs.
 
If you have any questions, Dr. Keith Taylor is the President of Modest Needs and his contact information is on the site. Thank you for your consideration of this organization as you decide how to pay forward the help you received.
 
Sincerely,
Bonnie B.

The Path to Freedom (http://pathtofreedom.com/journal/) is an amazing little site chronicling the path of one urban familys journey toward self-sufficiency, and their efforts to help all of us become less dependent.
 
They grow almost all of their own food on less than 1/5 of an acre (a typical urban plot) experiment with solar cooking, reuse water for gardening, hold gatherings to teach people how to brew biodiesel, show films (solar powered!).
 
Any kind of donation would not only help them, but would in turn help the thousands of other people they help, too.
 
Thanks for your consideration, and for your own good work!

Its a convenient notepad application that integrates into your Google Homepage. There are a few thousand regular users (i.e. who update their notes at least every couple of days), and our server got overloaded just before Thanksgiving. About a loooong week of downtime and many frustrated emails from users, things are back online.
 
Google Notes was first released in January and we only recently began accepting donations in the hopes of maintaining a high quality of service.

Title: Free Speech: Because We Can
 
In the field of Constitutional Law, there are many pages spent trying to come up with a reason for free speech. Its about the marketplace of ideas some say: by putting all claims and points of view out in the open, the public can sort through and figure out the truth, leaving the untruths to fall by the wayside. Others argue that free speech is necessary for democracy, since voters must hear different opinions to decide how to use their votes, and that since even non-political speech can change peoples views, all speech must then be protected.
 
There are many more justifications like this  a limit on government abuse, a policy to promote a more tolerant citizenship, etc.  but, like most justifications, they all say we should permit free speech because it allows us to do something else. And the frustrating thing about that is that it suggests that free speech should not be permitted when it doesnt achieve those goals.
 
Theorists of free speech are, in general, fans of the idea (or at least their market consists of fans) so they try to dance around this. Oh no, the marketplace-of-ideas partisans say, we werent suggesting that obviously false statements could be prohibited because, after all, you really never know when false statements could turn out to be true!
 
But, as something of a free speech absolutist, it troubles me that such a thing is even theoretically possible. And I worry that if others adopt this theory, they may not be so stringent about the practical requirements. The temptation to clamp down on free speech is always strong; its probably not a sound idea to build the principle on such a shaky foundation.
 
So I have my own justification for freedom of speech: because we can. Human freedom is important, so we should try to protect it from encroachment wherever possible. With most freedoms  freedom of motion, freedom of exchange, freedom of action  permitting them in full would cause some problems. People shouldnt be free to walk into other peoples bedrooms, take all their stuff, and then punch the poor victims in the face. But hurling a bunch of epithets at the guy really isnt so bad.
 
Freedom of speech is one place where we can draw the line and say: all of this is acceptable. Theres no further logic to it than that; freedom of speech is not an instrumental value. Like all freedom, its fundamental, and the only reason we happen to single it out is because its more reasonable than all of the others.
 
Close readers will note that this theory doesnt quite live up to my own goals. By laying freedom of speechs provision on top of our reasonable ability to do so, I suggest that freedom of speech could be taken away if providing it became unreasonable. But I think this is the right choice: if people really, seriously started getting hurt because of freedom of speech, it seems right for people to take the privilege away. But, to be honest, I cant even imagine how that might be possible. Words just dont genuinely wound, theyre always mediated by our listening.
 
I do worry that people might try to stretch this justification  say that continued free speech might destroy the war effort, or the government, or civil society. But I have no problem destroying all of those. Its only the destruction of actual people that I worry about.
 
So heres to free speech: because we can.

I fail to see how speech is distinguished here from freedom of movement etc. You start off with the classical-liberal sort of notion of having an implicit human right to use your capacities which outside powers need a good reason to take away. Then you say speech is less dangerous than many other things, but frankly its not. What would you make of the basic clampdowns on speech that the US Supreme Court has sort of evolved over the years? (Libel, Treason, Obscenity, Direct incentive to harm (fire in a crowded theater), etc.) I disagree with a lot of the sedition/obscenity rulings but its true that there is speech that can actually literally hurt people, just as movement etc. can.

The canonical example of free speech that can actually cause people to get hurt is yelling Fire! in a crowded theater.  The ensuing stampede for the exits is sure to cause one or more injuries.  And for that reason, such speech is indeed illegal.  See also, I believe, incitement to riot.

Title: Bread and Cheese
 
It seems like every Western food culture has some combination of bread and cheese as a meal. Americans, simple people, have your basic grilled cheese. But Italians have the pizza. Then theres the mac-and-cheese. And of course Mexicans with their quesadilla. Then theres the cheese calzone. Not to mention cheese crepes. Throw in meat and you can also count the famed cheeseburger.
 
What is so magical about this combination?

Pizza may have been made famous by the Italians, but its origin came from a Jewish chef in the service of a Sultan in Baghdad. However, you are partly right, that the meat was likely added by somebody else (given that mixing a milk product (cheese) and meat is neither Kosher nor Halal).
 
However, meat + bread combination also exists in Mediterranean / Middle Eastern cuisine / Indian cuisine e.g. curry inside Naan bread, Gyros.
 
I dont think theres anything magical about this combination. To borrow from Extreme Programming terminology, its the simplest thing that could possibly work.

Cheese has lots of saturated fat. Many cheeses are mostly saturated fat. As you know, Im not one for evolutionary explanations of human behavior but I think there might be one here in favor of our love for cheese. Its often as close to maximum nutrient density as you can get without drinking oil.
 
Bread (and other starches) provide a way to eat large amount of cheese without destroying our gall bladders or getting our fingers all greasy.

Sanzi (Deep-Fried Dough Twists)
 
Sanzi is one of traditional snacks of the Moslems. To make sanzi, use wheat flour mixed with vegetable oil and juice of the Chinese prickly ash. Knead the dough repeatedly, and then divide it into several pieces. Pull the dough into thin noodles and deep-fry in oil until golden yellow. During festivals, every Uygur family makes sanzi to treat guests.

Title: Identity Fetishism
 
Marx wrote incisively about commodity fetishismthe tendency of people to see only the results of production (commodities), ignoring the hours of human labor that actually created them. The humanities seems to suffer from something of the reverse problem: a tendency to be absorbed by the names of big people and not seeing beyond to the ideas they espouse.
 
The most extreme example is Leo Strauss, who encouraged his students to put aside their prejudices and fully imerse themselves in the worlds and minds of the greats. The greats were so great, Strauss suggested, that if you disagree with them, you probably just dont understand them well enough.
 
But even other teachers of philosophy have the same problem, presenting the views of X and Y even when X is pretty clearly wrong. Despite its absurdities, students must learn to understand Xs view. This seems fairly universal; even books like What is the Meaning of it All?, which explains philosophy without the names or complex terminology, still presents clearly bogus ideas on the same footing as more reasonable ones.
 
In other fields, this pattern is less frequent, but still there for whole courses of research. In sociology, papers must cite long-dead patron theorists to lend their empirical research an air of legitimacy by presenting it as a member of a recognized family. Even more recent works, like Annette Lareaus brilliant Unequal Childhoods, are at pains to show how they adhere to a theoretical model (the recently-alive Bourdieu in that case). In most other fields, the theorists take pains to make sure their work is consistent with the evidence, not the other way around.
 
Even in most humanities classes, the course content consists of a series of papers making arguments. The goal of the class is to understand the view of the authors and determine (in the best ones) to what extent you agree or disagree.
 
This isnt particularly unreasonable, but is a far cry from life in the hard sciences, where usually there is an actual consensus on some subject and otherwise there are a couple of named theories, each being developed by a group of people.
 
Why the diference? First, is it perhaps hard science thats in the wrong? I dont think so. The goal of science is to discover the truth about the world. Truths remain true no matter who says them and its unlikely that one person will discover the whole truth. Thus the pattern of letting multiple people develop a theory and try to find evidence for it to convince the others.
 
So why dont the softer sciences follow the same model? The problem gets worse the softer you get, which suggests the problem lies in the softness itself. The problem is that without identities, one has to judge the ideas themselves which, in a soft science is somewhat difficult to do.
 
Its easy in science to run an experiment and see if it proves a theory true or false, its much harder to get consensus about a reasonable theory of morality in philosophy. But it is easy to pick out the famous in academy culture and assign their stuff.
 
Identity fetishism thrives in a world afraid to make its own judgments. It exalts the thinkers of the past and, in doing so, diminishes its own capacities. But science must march forward instead of backward and that requires the daring to distinguish true from false.

The stuff of philosophy is ideas. Most of the stuff of hard sciences is material reality. Ideas need articulation. The greats are just those who articulated the ideas well.
 
Humanities courses do a fair bit of arguing about theories without references to greats. You can argue about democratic peace theory or whether protestantism fueled capitalism and western individualism without naming anyone.
 
The consensus model in the fields is exactly the same. The philosophy community chooses the great philosophers, thus establishing validity through consensus, just as the science community approaches consensus by filtering out theories they dont support, as human beings.
 
I find it rather surprising that you dont see the hard sciences straitjacketed by exactly the same we build on precedent notion of learning and teaching as the social ones are. Indeed the barrier to entry for a new idea in the social sciences is way lower than that in the hard sciences.
 
Clearly absurd thinkers and theories tend to fall by the wayside in both. I guess Im more prepared to relate endurance to quality (Darwinism of Ideas?) than you seem to be.

David: I am going into sociology. No science is without its flaws.
 
Firas: Did you really just suggest that the discoveries of physics dont need to be articulated because they are material reality? What is it you think that hard scientists do?
 
I think endurance in philosophy is related to interestingness, not accuracy. Take utilitarianism. Maybe Im reading the wrong journals, but it seems like most of the effort is spent repeating old holes poked in the theory, not working on patching them up.
 
My complaint isnt that the field builds on precedent, its that it doesnt build enough: a new thinker introduces a theory and either lauds it or everyone pokes holes until a newer theory comes along. Theres very little group work trying to improve theories.

Erm, no, if you look at the trajectory of Strauss work, he clearly rejects much of the work of the Greats: Heidegger, for just one example.  The point of Straussian hermeunetics is that understanding the greats as they understood themselves is just the required first step. After that has been achieved, then criticism is fully justified.
 
On a meta-level, one of Strauss main tenets was The Battle of the Ancients vs. Moderns, so the greats drastically disagree with each other - eventually, one needs to take some position and disagree with some of the greats at minimum.

I agree with Aarons original point. There is far too much lingering in philosophy especially. This is precisely where people like Feynman step in.
 
One of the most primitive human clan instincts is to gain recognition and respect. In philosophy that means coming up with significant improvements to an existing theory, creating an entirely new theory or aligning yourself with a previous theory or school of theories. It would seem that aligning is much easier than actually doing original work. So maybe philosophy is in this state simply because its the path of least resistance (or path of greatest laziness).

Title: Disinfecting the Sunlight Foundation
 
For years, Mike Klein was a big-time D.C. corporate lawyer. Hed made millions starting a string of companies, including an air cargo carrier, a D.C. restaurant, a D.C. art gallery, and a real estate information database. But then Kleins son, aghast at the horrors of his government under Bush II, fled the country. Or, as Klein put it in an interview with the Harvard Law School Alumni Bulletin, My two sons led me to realize that a significant part of their generation thinks democracy isnt worth engagement or even respect. For an old 1960s activist like myself, that was the tipping point.
 
Its natural for a father to want to fix things for his sons (and perhaps for a wealthy D.C. lawyer to feel a bit guilty about it as well), so Klein, leaning a bit more on his corporate millions than his sixties activism, started a foundation. Taking its name from Justice Brandeiss famed comment that Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants, the Sunlight Foundation was formed to promote transparency and accountability in American government.
 
Most such organizations would do this by running investigations and publishing reports, but the Sunlight Foundation decided to take a different tack. Instead, as Klein put it, Sunlight would be utilizing 21st Century information technology, and Web 2.0 energy.
 
The Foundation was formed in January 2006 and, thanks to Klein, was quickly swimming in cash. Their first major project was Congresspedia, a Wikipedia-like site to keep track of information on members of Congress. Unlike most Web 2.0 sites, they bought large ads on the major political weblogs to promote the new site. (Despite this blanket promotion  and the hiring of a full-time editor  the site seems to have about the same level of activity as the They Might Be Giants wiki.)
 
Some of their other projects are about what youd expect: a federal funding-Google Maps mashup, a Congressional tag cloud, a video contest mocking of members of Congress who dont release their schedules. (Theyve also donated money to already-existing related projects, many of which are doing valuable work.)
 
Their most recent project was an invite-only conference in San Francisco to bring together the leaders in this nascent field. (Disclosure: I attended and just about everyone there from the Sunlight Foundation invited me to take their money.) Funder Klein hailed the Foundation as the most important and fastest-growing project hed ever started, while executive director Ellen Miller noted that this year theyd launched several projects, all of which had been successes. (Afterwards I asked her what her metric for success was. Were throwing stuff up on the wall and seeing what sticks, she explained. And success, I confirmed, means it hasnt completely fallen apart yet.)
 
As a Web 2.0 developer, its hard for me to see how even the best Web 2.0 site can have much of a positive impact on government. Genuinely promoting transparency requires the hard work of doing investigative research, publishing reports, and promoting them to the media. Bubble 2.0 hype aside, the fanciest pop-up windows and and Google Maps mashups wont change that.
 
The attendees seemed to begin to recognize this. In a breakout session on reaching users, a guru from Web 2.0 consultancy Adaptive Path tried to walk us through their user experience process. Remember, she told us, these sites arent about what you want to do; theyre about improving the lives of your users by connecting with their real needs. We gave our example user a name (Jane) and backstory (too busy driving her kids to care about politics, but upset at the high gas prices she has to pay). And thats where we got stuck. Is Jane really going to muddle through graphs generated from FEC reporting data?
 
We decided our saviors would be the Paul Reveres  the people who care enough about politics to slog through the data and then mass email their friends when they find something good (we concluded that going after newspaper reporters was too Web 1.0). They would save us from having to write reports or take positions; all we had to do was make the data available and let them do the rest.
 
Im sure there are a handful of people who actually do this, but it seems like were spending an awful lot to build a site just for them. And even then, what impact will they have? Even if our Paul Revere finds the smokingest of smoking guns and posts it on their extremely popular blog, without a larger political platform it will only fuel the cynicism that Klein claims hes trying to combat. (There they go again, the reader thinks, and hits the back button.)
 
Even if Klein is for some reason averse to taking an actual political stand (maybe he doesnt vote the same way as his sons?), theres still much to be done. Several people in the session were from the group that runs the opensecrets.org website, which details who contributes to which campaign. Its useful stuff, but even a hundred of their reports cant compare to their old-fashioned, dead-trees book Speaking Freely, which brilliantly details the big picture of how money politics actually works. The author of the book, Larry Makinson, was in the room, but instead of figuring out how to tell more stories like that, he was busy worrying about how to make specific numbers come alive.
 
But what makes Speaking Freely so brilliant is that it shows specifics arent the problem. Its not that donors bribe politicians into changing their vote  they rarely do  its that the entire campaign finance system forces all our public officials to bend and scrape before big-money donors, instead of actually listening to the voters.
 
Such clear analysis makes the solution clear as well: we need to get rid of privately-financed elections altogether. And, in fact, there is an organization doing just that. Its called Public Campaign and, considering the enormous odds its up against, its having incredible success. (Arizona, Connecticut, and Maine have all adopted clean elections and smaller projects have been started in six more states.) But the Sunlight Foundation isnt giving money to Public Campaign. To the contrary, many of its top people used to work there.
 
Public Campaign is just one example; the larger point is that just as Web 2.0 pixie dust doesnt automatically make your web site into a success, just making important data available wont cause political change. Justice Brandeiss clever aphorism to the contrary, sunlight is not in fact the best disinfectant; actual disinfectant is. Sunlight just makes it easier for people to look at the pus.
 
The Sunlight Foundation responds: Many people from the Sunlight Foundation have thoughtfully written to me. Aside from our general disagreement about the value of the projects Sunlight engages in, they make several specific points. Since they havent provided any letters for publication, Ill try to summarize them as fairly as I can:
 
Its not a zero-sum game. The open data work that Sunlight funds helps projects like Public Campaign by giving them ammunition. Center for Responsive Politics data makes it into corruption stories in newspapers which, in turn, has made the issue of clean elections a more serious part of the public debate.
 
Sunlight has many other projects. Theyve provided serious grants to a number of organizations  including the Center for Responsive Politics  and have a number of projects, including hiring some bloggers, doing distributed journalism on Congresss Family Business, getting 90 candidates to sign their Punch Clock Agreeement, and even writing an old-fashioned report.
 
Sunlight has a good relation with Public Campaign. Mike Klein has made donations to Public Campaign on his own; Ellen Miller started Public Campaign but left long before she joined Sunlight; Micah Sifry was already lowering the amount of time he spent working for Public Campaign before he joined Sunlight.
 
I dont dispute any of these points, but I think the brunt of my critique still stands. Changes to the culture of Washington must be structural ones. These projects, while fun, fundamentally misunderstand how institutions operate.

And even then, what impact will they have? Even if our Paul Revere finds the smokingest of smoking guns and posts it on their extremely popular blog, without a larger political platform 
 
Exactly! Completely correct. And the cynical observers say that the solution here is that the result will be providing of unpaid labor to those who have that larger political platform. And it can just be a sorting effect - only those items helpful to the larger political platform gain traction (while simulataneously being shouted to the skies as triumphs of citizen journalism, pay no attention to the moneybags behind the curtain ).

Public funding of political campaigns is the way to go. Weve done that in France and even if it doesnt solve all the issues, it clears at least some of the worries about independance and representing the people.
 
Now Im not sure a few Web 2.0 sites will be enough to drive this change. Over here, the change was driven by huge financing scandals where parties from both sides admitted to diverting public money to finance the campaigns.

Title: San Francisco: Silicon Valleys Ghetto
 
Big American cities have a shameful history of setting up smaller ones into which to punt the workers who make their city run. In Amazing Grace, Jonathan Kozol writes heart-wrenchingly about life in East St. Louis. And a little closer to home, in the shining Valley city of Palo Alto, the workers and their families (as usual, mostly people of color) are shunted into East Palo Alto at the end of the day.
 
Not only does this keep the workers and their families out of sight and out of crime, but it has beneficial political effects too. The workers may elect their own mayor, who is economically powerless to do anything about their plight, and they may attend their own school system, maintaining the new racial and economic segregation of American schools. (Incidentally, Stanford recently purchased East Palo Alto High School so it can run experiments on the poor children.)
 
It would be absurd and offensive to compare life in San Francisco to life in these impoverished neighborhoods, but I cant help but feel there are some structural similarities. Whatever else San Francisco is, it is a reaction to the Valley. Many of the people Ive met here are doing their best to escape their stifling Silicon Valley jobs, taking the bus or train or car every day into work, then running back as soon as they can.
 
The result is that San Francisco ends up being something like the opposite of the Valley. The Valley has its clean if gray office buildings in neat squares; San Francisco has its rough and random dirty shops and houses drizzled across hillsides. The Valley is full of conservative corporate behavior; San Francisco is full of left-wing activists. The Valley is where people work, so San Francisco is where they play, throwing frisbees in parks and hanging out in coffee shops or going to dance parties at night. The Valley is a place of businesslike behavior; in San Francisco people hug deeply when they meet. (Not everyone, of course; none of this is everyone, but more than enough to be noticeable.)
 
The result, like some Marxist dialectic, is that neither the City nor the Valley really feel real. Both are reacting against each other, playing off their faults, waiting for some synthesis to put the pieces back together. The result is, to be sane you have to be in both.
 
City people refer to Palo Alto as Shallow Alto, which might even be literally true. The city is a thin strip of road, surrounded on one side by houses and on the other by offices, with Stanford behind it and other cities in front. It is, perhaps, a decent place to work  the finest upscale fakery you can find along relatively clean streets where even the homeless are white  but its apparently a terribly boring place to live.
 
Meanwhile the city is all action. People are intellectually lazy here, complains one resident. You can zip around on bikes and scooters, drop into parties and nightclubs, gab with friends, eat good food, stroll by shops, do everything but actually get work done. People here are fleeing from work, not looking for it.
 
And so, to live, you ping-pong back and forth. A job you hate in the Valley, but you have to keep it so that it pays the exorbitant rent in the City, which you have to live in to escape the deadliness of the Valley. High highs, low lows, bright nights, dark days.
 
I suspect the City works as an escape valve in other ways. Instead of unioninizing your big corporate employer, you simply flee to a False Profit party, secure in your anti-capitalist sentiment. Instead of working to build a better life, you go out dancing with your friends, trying to enjoy the little time you have.
 
Which, I have to say, is better than most. Most office drones just go home and watch TV, their work having drained from them the energy for any more productive activity. I suspect some of the difference lies in the peculiar economics of the computer industry. The people in it are unusually smart and talented. And the barriers to entry are so low that if they wanted to they could start their own thing (and, as the startup world shows, many do). So perhaps one has to heighten the distractions to keep them busy.
 
But who knows? Ive got a party to get to.

While I respect your right to express your view, I believe, in this case, that your view is extremely skewed, nave and reactionary.
 
It is surely true that where there is a larger concentration of corporate business (the Valley), there is a more pervasive clean-cut work attitude. Its also true that San Francisco (the City) is much more eclectic and amorous than the Valley. Stating that one feeds off of the other in the way that you describe, though, is a beginners mistake.
 
The City has deep roots in its crazy/funky/cool culture, dating back much farther than the Valley or anything else equally trite around it. The City is being nothing but itself. It doesnt react to or leech off or bend for anything other than itself. Treating the City as anything other than the extremely autonomous, complex being that has grown to be is insulting to those who make up the City and its entirely unique identity.
 
The City does not react to the Valley. The City does not need the Valley. The Valley is a side effect that can account for its own corporate stodginess and lack of character through pure introspection. The City doesnt respect the Valley precisely because it lacks true character and true quality.
 
Embrace the City. Live in it, with it and through it. Experience the good, the bad and the truly unique things that the City has to offer. Do all of that and become a part of the City without insulting it with this drivel; either that or go back to Boston.

Theres plenty of boring corporate offices in the financial district. In fact, the jobs are likely far more of the soul-draning in those offices, than any of the jobs in the city (I have tons of coworkers from the city who pretty much say the same  all the jobs in the city, are pretty much, 9-5 dress-code-required type). There also does exist a conservative constituency in the city (theres a good article in Reason about that whole community, which I just am not able to find it, which is also mostly socially conservative Catholics), albeit small, but very well connected.
 
Likewise, The Valley is still a liberal/Democratic strong hold, with perhaps a few libertarian leaning types (but likely even fewer

Aha, double quotes is what is causing the reply to get eaten. Is this a bug or this an intended feature?
 
Again, here is second paragraph onwards:
 
Likewise, The Valley is still a liberal/Democratic strong hold, with perhaps a few libertarian leaning types (but likely even fewer God and Gays (*) conservatives than in the city). While there are indeed more office parks, many of the places are very much unlikely the Dilbertesque cube-farms and offer significant choices to the employees. The Valley is also not without a non-corporate culture: theres plenty of independent book stores, independent coffee shops  especially in places like Palo Alto, Mountain View and Downtown San Jose.
 
The real difference is not political, nor economic. Its cultural: people who are used to East Coast urban cores generally dont last long in the valley and move up to San Francisco; likewise, people brought in bedroom communities / suburbia of say, Southern California, would prefer suburban Silicon Valley.
 
God and Gays was meant to double quoted, but this is apparently what caused the rest of the comment to the cut off.

Thats a pretty broad brush, Aaron.
 
It is extremely fashionable to riff on how suburbs are isolating, soul-deadening gardens of commercialism, but it is also starting to get really tiresome.  Ive lived for 4 years in the valley, and for 4 years before that I lived in a big city.  I have met at least as many interesting people living in suburbia as I did in my previous, more urban, setting.  There are some things missing from suburbia, like live music.  But there are plenty of things missing from cities as well - such as the ability to get away from people.  I can ride my bike 30 minutes up into the hills and be totally alone.
 
Its not as black and white as you make it.  Sure, if you visit the suburbs once you might think theres nobody here but bluetooth-headset-shouting, bmw-driving assholes, but youd be wrong.  Just like youd be wrong if you visited the city once and thought that everybody there was an insufferable hipster.
 
Oh, and Brad Fults:  Arrogant, too cool for their shoes, pseudo-enlightened assholes like you are the half the reason I dont live in SF. The city does not need the valley?  Hah!  Take a look at 101 tomorrow morning and tell me how many people drive back and forth between the two every day.  Both the valley and the city would be shadows of their current selves if they were removed from each other.

Aaron,
 
The bottom line is that there are City people and Suburb people, and never the twain shall meet.  Even when I was an undergrad at Stanford, I despised San Francisco, and prayed that I would never have to live there.
 
I would also agree that for the highly-educated, mostly white overclass of the Bay Area, its unclear that San Francisco is any more authentic than the Valley.  At least the Valley is honest about what it is.  The City pretends to be a multi-cultural, egalitarian haven, when in fact few of the techie class that lives there interacts with poor minorities outside of retail salespeople, their gardeners, and their nannies.

No I totally agree with this.  While I work in the city (I still work for a nice gray institution that drains every ounce of energy out of my body) and live in the city - I agree.  I have lived here for almost 5 years and feel caught in the hamster wheel of working to live & pay rent and then trying to fit in all the other things about the city in my free time (that is not consumed with sleeping).  I feel like when I pop out of SF (I am a Cali native) - I am going to wonder where the last 5 years went.

Youve hit the nail on the head, for my experience at least  which is almost identical to yours. A lot of geek imports to the Valley feel the same way.
 
But these places existed long before tech got here, and will exist long after.
 
SF has the among most vibrant local political and social cultures in the entire USA, so they have a future after tech has gone. But theres no denying that the techie lifestyle refugees have an impact; if they were the only economic force, SF would just become a theme-park of what it used to be.
 
You might like Hollow City by Rebecca Solnit. Its a rambling but heartfelt essay on what the first boom did to SF. Theres also a stab at defining the economic history of artists in SF.

The City has been around a lot longer than Silicon Valley - it has its own thing going on.
 
There may seem to be many people commuting from SF to the Valley, but I would bet you the actual number of commuters is fewer than 20,000 people. Most San Francisco residents actually work in San Francisco.
 
And if you are truly looking for Silicon Valleys ghetto, you seem to have overlooked San Jose

Norcal Barney is right: San Jose is Silicon Valleys ghetto.  It is the only US city of more than 500,000 people that actually loses population during the day when people go to work.  Thats why it cant shake its reputation as a bedroom community (since thats precisely what it is).
 
San Francisco, on the other hand, gains several hundred thousand people during the day (not including tourists).  It may seem like no one works in SF if you dont live here, but the City is headquarters of WellsFargo, Bank of the West, Del Monte, GAP, Levis, Charles Schwab, The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, The California Supreme Court, and thousands of other companies, magazines, non-profits, and government agencies.  The Bay Bridge is also the busiest bridge in the country (slightly busier than the George Washington bridge in NY) - not sure what all those people are doing on the bridge coming over from the East Bay in the morning if its not to go to work downtown.

Title: Ostensible Networks vs. Friendship Networks
 
I visited New York last weekend and although Id physically been there many times before, this was the first time I felt like Id really seen the city. Ostensibly, its very easy to go to New York. There are lots of plane tickets available online and then you can book a hotel right there. Ive done this many times before and every time I came away feeling like I hadnt really seen New York, but only bits and pieces made available for tourist consumption. I didnt feel like I understood the city.
 
It wasnt until this time, when I stayed with generous friends, that I felt I really saw the city. They showed me cute little places to eat, explained how to use the impossibly complex transit system, pointed me to maps and websites to help, recommended good spots to see at good times, and simply let me be with actual New Yorkers. I saw New York through the eyes of a New Yorker.
 
Now there are ostensible systems to help with all of these. There are guidebooks to recommend restaurants and infodesks and posters to explain how things work, but they never really can surpass the power of a friend.
 
If you look, you see ostensible networks everywhere. Ostensibly, jobs are posted in the want ads, but you can definitely snag one if you have a friend. Ostensibly, there are bureaucratic rules that must be followed, but usually can bypass them with a friend on the inside. Ostensibly, academic fields are learnable by anyone, but to really understand them you need a friend to take you through it. Ostensibly, web sites are supposed to be clear enough that anyone can use them, but for most of them you need a friend to show you how its done.
 
A lot of people dont realize the importance of friendship networks. They think the world largely works the way its ostensibly supposed to. You do good work, you follow the rules, you get noticed, you get the benefits. And when they fail to succeed or comprehend, its probably because theyre stupid or somebody isnt following the system. But its neither of those, its the system thats stupid  you dont succeed through hard work, you succeed through friendship networks.
 
This has clear implications for ones personal behavior: when you want to do something, dont follow the rules but look for a friend. (Sure, you could stay in a New York hotel  but youd be much better off sleeping on the floor of a friend.) And build up lots of friends so that youll be able to call on them when you need them. (Find a book you really like? Send the author a friendly note.)
 
But it also has systematic implications. Because our friendship networks are so skewed towards others like us, making things dependent of friendship networks serves as a subtle form of discrimination and exclusion. A stranger in the middle of Nebraska will have a hard time learning Geology because they dont know any geologists. A writer living deep in Kansas will have a hard time getting their work published because few of the publishers have ever heard of them.
 
There are two ways to fight this. One is to be more generous about finding friends. Get to know random people who email you, talk to people on the plane or at the theater, take part in activities that go beyond your typical location and social stratum.
 
But these techniques can only go so far  despite my best efforts, Ill never be able to even consider being friends with the vast majority of the worlds population. The better option is to help move things from friendship networks to ostensible networks, to document the cool places in New York City, to start websites where you can find people to stay with, to not automatically give jobs and perks to friends, to build things clear enough that anyone can use them.
 
Sure, it can be hard to say no to a friend. But wouldnt you want someone to extend you the same courtesy?

Title: Kahle v. Ashcroft write-up
 
Heres a writeup I did of the Kahle v. Ashcroft argument in the style of a Wired News piece. Unlike my last parody of Wired News, this one actually got posted on wired.com, albeit only on one of their blogs. I hope to write a real post about this but Im feeling too crummy to do it today.
 
SAN FRANCISCO, CaliforniaAcclaimed Stanford professor Lawrence Lessig and Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle argued Monday that the changes in the Copyright Act should be subject to the scrutiny of the First Amendment. In the case Kahle v. Gonzales, argued here at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Brewster Kahle is arguing that he should be permitted to make orphaned worksworks whose copyright holder can no longer be locatedavailable for free on his website.
 
The case began after Lessigs loss before the Supreme Court in his previous suit, Eldred v. Ashcroft. Lessig argued that Congresss perpetual extension of the copyright act violated the Constitutions requirement that copyright only be granted for limited Times. The Court disagreed, saying that Congress was allowed to modify copyright law as long as it didnt change the laws traditional contours.
 
Now Lessig is back, arguing that Congress has done just that. For nearly two hundred years, he notes, copyright has been an opt-in system. Authors who wanted their work to be copyrighted had to mark it with a copyright symbol, file a registration with the Copyright Office, deposit a copy with the Library of Congress, and file a renewal if they wanted to receive the full term. All that changed with the sweeping 1976 Copyright Act, which made a work copyrighted as soon as it was fixed in a tangible form.
 
Under the old system, according to Lessig, 93% of works went into the public domain before their term had expired. Now, 0% do.
 
Lessig argues that such a fundamental change  moving copyright from an opt-in to an opt-out system  constitutes a change in the laws traditional contours and thus, under the precedent set in Eldred, means the law must be examined by a Court to see if it violates the First Amendment.
 
The Government disagrees, insisting that the only traditional contours the Eldred decision refers to are the fair use provision of the copyright law, which allows for the public to make certain uses of copyrighted works, and the idea-expression dichotomy, which means that ideas cannot be directly copyrighted, only their expression. The 1976 law did not change either of these.
 
The judges hearing the case asked Lessig to explain how this case differed from Eldred. In Eldred the argument was about whether Congress could retrospectively extend the copyright law to keep Mickey Mouse out of the public domain, he explained. This case is only about orphaned works  works whose copyright holders cant even be tracked down to give permission. Unlike Disney, the judge added.
 
The Kahle case is part of a multi-pronged strategy to deal with orphaned works. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) has introduced a bill called the Public Domain Enhancement Act. The idea, based on a New York Times op-ed published by Lessig shortly after his loss in Eldred, is that copyright holders will need to send $1 to the government after 50 years to renew their copyright. If they dont send the dollar, their works will go into the public domain. But even if they do, their name and address will be on file so others who wish to use the work will know how to contact them.
 
The US Copyright Office has also held hearings on the subject of orphaned works, concluding in a hundred-page report sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee that The orphan works problem is real. and Legislation is necessary to provide a meaningful solution to the orphan works problem as we know it today.
 
Plaintiff Brewster Kahle founded the Internet Archive after selling his company Alexa to Amazon.com in the 1990s. The site, as Kahle often says, provides infinite bandwidth and infinite disk space for infinite time to freely-licensed works. Kahle wants to have his website provide orphaned works, just as libraries make available out-of-print books, but under current law would have to track down the copyright holder for every work.
 
The same problem plagues projects like Googles Book Search. Presently, Google must track down the copyright holder before making a book publicly available or face hefty fines. But since copyright terms are now so long, this means most out-of-print books will never be available, simply because their copyright holders are so difficult to find.
 
The Court is expected to rule on the case sometime next year.

Title: Office Space
 
People are always asking me how I manage to get so much done. For a while I tried to impress them with my pearls of wisdom but soon I just sort of gave up. I dont really feel like I do anything special  I worry about getting stuff done a lot, but mostly I just sort of do it.
 
It wasnt until I started working in an office that the question begun to make sense. Since I moved to San Francisco I literally havent gotten anything done. I havent finished a book (I finished three on the plane out here), I havent answered many emails (I used to answer hundreds a day), Ive written only a couple blog posts (I used to do one a day), and I havent written a line of code (I used to write whole programs in the evenings). Its a pretty incredible state of affairs.
 
You wake up in the morning, take some crushing public transit system or dodge oncoming traffic to get to work, grab some food, and then sit down at your desk. If youre like most people, you sit at a cube in the middle of the office, with white noise buzzing around on every side. Were lucky enough to get our own shared office, but its not much better since its huge windows overlook a freeway and the resulting white noise is equally deadening.
 
Wired has tried to make the offices look exciting by painting the walls bright pink but the gray office monotony sneaks through all the same. Gray walls, gray desks, gray noise. The first day I showed up here, I simply couldnt take it. By lunch time I had literally locked myself in a bathroom stall and started crying. I cant imagine staying sane with someone buzzing in my ear all day, let alone getting any actual work done.
 
Nobody else seems to get work done here either. Everybodys always coming into our room to hang out and chat or invite us to play the new video game system that Wired is testing. The upside is that while we havent gotten much of our work done, we have managed to do many other peoples. Various folks from around the office have shown up to have us help them with their technical problems, which we usually solve fairly quickly. We joked that we should get transferred to their IT department instead of Web development.
 
Weve been spared most of the brunt of it, but their IT policy is pretty scary. Theres a company Internet connection, which routes everything through the IT HQ in Delaware, presumably the better to spy on us on. On Day 1 they took our laptops and backed up the drives to ensure they had a copy of all our data. (We scurried to get our MP3 collections and worse off first.)
 
Then they issued us company-approved laptops: terribly-slow iBook G4s complete with Conde Nast desktop and screensaver with spy software pre-installed. When they gave us the machines we didnt even have administrator access on them. The clock was set to the Eastern time zone; I needed an IT department person to change it to show me California time.
 
The company laptop is necessary to read our company email which, being on a Microsoft Exchange server, requires a special Microsoft email client to read. You also need to be on a company laptop to access the company network, where you can log into a maze of PeopleSoft web sites to file expense reports and change your health benefits.
 
I feel wiped after dealing with this non-work for a couple hours, but I cant get any rest from lying on our couch because it too is surrounded by the white noise.
 
Finally at 5 the office empties out and I can go home where, to compensate for the dullness of the days, I brighten up the nights. Life-threatening bicycle rides, dinners and movies with friends, museums, running along the beach, navigating the nightmare of public transit to visit the new hot spot. And if I get home early there are the roommates eager to chat about their days. By the time I break away its midnight, if not 3am. I had to spend much of the weekend sleeping just to catch up.
 
And then its back to the grind once again. A carousel that never stops to let you get off.

Ouch.
 
I have a theory that a company would be served by having all employees and all management write a daily blog, publicly viewable.  When hiring, an applicant can read the blogs of his would-be co-workers and would-be manager.  Reading, searching for cluelessness.
 
People dont like to write, people dont like to think.  Those are the first two problems with that idea.
 
You could use tricks to make daily writing painless.  A company could hire a cartoonist, to draw a daily cartoon without words, and all employees would have to compose a caption.  Or, more mundanely, give out a daily short creative writing exercise.
 
The professional world makes cluelessness easy to hide.  If the suit and offices are respectable enough, almost any form of brain-damage or psychosis can be hidden for decades.
 
My advice, literally chain yourself to your bosss desk (for added drama, use a chain of Kryptonite bicycle locks, the last one around your neck), and demand a private, acoustically dead office.  The halfway measures you will try over the next few months (begging, pleading, passive-aggressive behavior) will be more humiliating in aggregate, and not as effective.

I work down the way from your office at UCSF in Mission Bay. I was suffering from similar problems and ended up petitioning to occupy some empty space we have. After some special meetings my request was approved and I now find myself in a large empty space with only a few other people about 20 meters away. In other words, peace, quiet, and a great view of the bay. Which equals me getting lots of work done and not wanting to even leave to go home.
 
Corporate thinking is backwards. Make your employees happy. Give them a space to think and dont limit anything they can do.
 
Google seems to be doing lots of things right.
 
But in the meantime, if you need an empty and quiet desk with a great, albeit industrial, east facing view of the bay, let me know :).

We are now limited to 100 MB on the server (whats that, a couple PowerPoint decks?), and if we want to centrally manage our email then we have to use Microsofts client-side program to download the e-mail to a PC, and then forward from that weak link back to our gmail, yahoo, whatever account.
 
Maybe the Vista release was a distraction while Microsofts real mission was to infiltrate more corporate servers and continuing their hold on the clientside market.

I used to work in a high-distraction office like that. I got myself moved to more private, quieter space  it made an enormous difference to my sanity and productivity.
 
Maybe you guys need to get your own separate office space, not even in the Wired building. Now is the time to make noise about it.

Success should only be measured by the satisfaction you receive from your work.  Selling out to DorkCorp  is a sure way to fail. Find the nearest exit and go start another venture.  Reddit will die a slow horrid corporate death and we will all cry but at least you will save your own soul.

What you need to do is to start cultivating the afternoon nap. After they find you slumped over your keyboard asleep 3 or 4 times, theyll give you gardening leave and a severance package. And then you can go back to real life and doing what you actually want to do!

Take solace in the fact that builders (programmers, engineers, etc.) are very often hindered by environments that sap creativity and productivity, so youre in no way alone.  Its why every engineer wants to work at Google  building employee ideas are the core of the business.  Most companies lose that startup-ishness over time as they feel pressure to milk their successes rather than continue to innovate.

I echo someone elses comment here, you do have a lot of balls! Having said that I have been through something very similar and found that a switch of environments is almost always painful and involves a couple of months of getting used to. Use your ipod with noise canceling headphones for the sound. Search the office for a less noisy place, even if Wired doesnt have enough space for offices for everyone I am sure they have some cubicles in an area where not many people walk by.
 
Finally, the thing that should give you the most hope is that people are nice. Amongst the kind of people I expect to work at Wired, I would also expect people who have founds ways and means of getting around the draconian IT policy. I know people at my company who have. Hell you may even find a sympathetic IT admin for some inside help ;)

Hi Aaron. Thats a nice little business conundrum you got there. My advice is to talk about this with the people you made the deal with/ the people who have some sort of interest in reddit and the power to make executive decisions. 
Focus on how reddit brings value to them and explain how the current office environment will destroy that value, how they will make less profit both short and long term. Explain that the value they get from reddit and from the reddit crew depends on certain work conditions. Then youll find out if they understand what youre talking about and hopefully ask what conditions youd like.
But remember, talk to the people who have the power to decide, not your nearest boss, and talk about value, cost efficiency and profit. It might piss your boss off but its the only way to get a change.

I know that sounds combative and insulting, but it is intended to be neither, and is probably the most productive comment youll receive.
 
Im simply reacting to what sounds like a need for better coping skills, and to adapt to and see the positives in change. As it is your cheese has been moved  to reference a terribly overused meme, so youre feeling vulnerable and negative about everything around you. In many ways this almost reads like the first letter home from summer camp, when everything stinks and is yucky and everyone is mean and cant you come and pick me up mom?
 
Did you ever go away to summer camp? Did you go away for university?
 
Of course, empire-building asshat IT departments and policies are an epic annoyance in this industry. Theyre basically a set of policies built around keeping Timmy the gator in sales from opening viruses disguised an porn email, but theyre a major pain in the ass for people who know what theyre doing.

Hello,
 
Ive been a IT consultant for over 10 years now.  In that time Ive had to catch flights in snowstorms, been shoved in corners and tiny ridiculous cubicles by clients.  Been treated like subclass dirt by full time employees of clients.  Stood at White Plains airport for 2 hours every Friday night waiting for a flight to chicago.  Been under enormous deadline pressure under impossible circumstances created by clueless project managers.

Speaking from experience of being stuck in a situation like that for 2 years before an Office Space/The Office marathon made me aware of it.
 
Get out NOW.
 
It took over a year of time off to get back to normal productivity. Environments like that drain your life and creativity, and even now Im much more reluctant to start new ideas I have.
 
I thought I could change the place for colleagues and I, but months of meetings and having suggestions shot down completely kills your self esteem. Then you start wondering if youre the only one who notices how messed up the environment youre in is.
All other co-workers seem content to be given even the slightest amount of freedom from monotony, akin to a caged pet being delighted at the chance to run free for 5 minutes per week.
 
The worst part is that you dont notice it changing you until its too late. When you find yourself attending corporate productivity getaways or customer service seminars and thinking that theyre a great motivation to keep working for a few months longer.
 
By the time I left, it took me 1 solid week to clear out and delegate all the email or work thatd built up over time, and Id spotted emails sent by friends 6 months earlier asking if I wanted to catch up over the weekend.
You find yourself attending work sponsored parties where everyone is asking everyone else What do you do for a living?, then seeing the blank stare of apathy on their faces as they pretend to care, much like you pretend to care how well their department is doing.
 
Id better stop here, as all the horrible memories are gushing back and making me ask myself Why didnt I leave on the first day after training like one of the other guys did?.
 
Heed my warning, get out before it really starts to change you, and you live your life one weekend at a time.

Re what Dennis Forbes said.
 
I dont believe this is a question of growing up. Anyone who thinks that is being condescending, even though they may think it is good advice.
 
To those who suggested work arounds for Exchange: snicker, sigh! Thats just a symptom  the disease is systemic and unwinnable  organizational lupus.
 
Speak to Paul. I am sure he would be distressed at your situation and would recommend some exits. After all, the idea from at least one of his essays was how to deliver superb value/wealth to the world and retire from the workaday misery of ordinary folk who spend a lifetime delivering close to zilch value in an office-space environment.
 
Especially when you have so many better things to do. Youre a good writer and (I am sure) programmer. There are hundreds of problems to be solved out there, millions of other things to do.
 
Dont sell yourself short. Jeez, youd have a better office environment in Microsoft, where you can bring your apple laptop to work.
 
To those who think youre making life tough for your co-workers etc.  get over it! This is not a personal attack on Wired. If a problem exists, the first thing a hacker does is acknowledge it, instead of hiding behind management-speak.
 
Show your manager the Parable of the Developer and ESRs managing hackers article. If he doesnt get it, refuse to fill in the peoplesoft timesheet. What, its not like you need the money that bad, and a little passive resistance wont hurt (unless youre at UCLA). Turn up to work as usual, just refuse to jump through the bureaucratic hoops.
 
Theyll let you work from home rather than deal with the aggravating holes youre causing in daily/weekly reports.
 
This is a classic test of PGs assertions that large companies can outsource innovation  that much is true, but perhaps he should write a follow-up on how small companies can survive once bought out.
 
PG and you both see the problem clearly enough. Now its time to hack a solution!
 
And cheer up! Remember you can walk away anytime you want. Reddit can be the throw-away first project, you have much more within you!

My advise, to you and all others in similar plight, invest in a good set of headphones (Bose maybe) and wear a deep baseball cap for that tunnel vision. And yeah, remember to take a lot of short breaks from your computer. Sometimes the crowd around can make (ironically) you not want to leave your desk too.
 
And yeah, get a remote connection setup, so that you can work from home two three (or how many ever you can persuade your manager to agree with) number of days from work.
 
Start early to work, and dont spend a minute more than the required time. The remainder of it, work at home on GNU/Linux (or even better on a new Lisp compiler).

Take a holiday bro. Youve just been through an enormous amount of stress. Start-up + negotiations + buyout + move to new city = burnout. No wonder youre melting down.
 
Im an only child, a little bit aspergery and noisy offices affect me physically.  My one year at a large corporate reduced me to blubbing in bathrooms too. I hated it and will never put myself in that situation ever again. Im a hundred times more productive tele-working from my home office.
 
Take a break, kick back and sort your head out.  You need to format C the whole hard drive and set a clean system back up. It takes time to get over major events in your life and if you dont relax then youll just keep crashing.

White noise often kills me too. A really simple suggestion: ear plugs. They look ridiculous, but some days they save my sanity. I have big red and black industrial strength ear-muff style ones which work amazingly at stopping the noise. I dont often wear these in public though, and they can be hot at times. Industrial strength small foam plugs are also extremely good and unobtrusive. I use these most often at the office; but they make the insides of my ears itch after a while. Finally, my last line of defense is a pair of noise-canceling audio headphones. But these can be dangerous as they often come along with another sort of distraction. <-: The ones I have are in-ear buds. They work sort of. They produce their own white noise which is a bit annoying, but its of an entirely different nature: suddenly a quiet noise inside ones own head is better than the more ambient external noise. Anyhow, nice writing

* Window office
* Has a couch
* Friendly, outgoing coworkers
 
Sounds awful!
 
Also: if you can somehow manage to get the local administrator password, do it. IT usually doesnt care if you install stuff/generally mess with your own computer, they just dont want to support it when it breaks. But YMMV, and they may be really security-crazy and fire you and press charges. Who knows.

Well, youve got the spectrum of replies from toughen up to quit.  I find too many people suck it up (and become bitter old people - In my day my boss treated us like slaves.  Be happy you get a choice about lunch.), and when I see someone that doesnt accept that, I applaud.  Honestly, its the uncommon position to take, and because of that you generally have be of stronger will than those who suck it up and think theyre the tough ones.
 
As one of the successful ones, or so I presume, you have to put your foot down for all those who cant (wont actually).  Whos gonna make the situation better if everyone just sucks it up?  Now, maybe you suck it up for a short time, a couple months, but any longer and youre joining the line of suckers who are too afraid of real change (unless your goal your own Dilbert comic).  Sometimes it can be done on the inside, and its a personal question if you really want to be that person because it takes a lot of time and effort the larger more established a company is.
 
I say let the companies compete.  If you arent willing to use the power you have as an employee, that being quitting and going someplace else, then companies wont ever have to really compete for employees.  Competition has a great way of equalizing the field, especially if you can find a competitor that treats you better and in turn competes better.  Dont be pressured into accepting unhappy conditions because others were pressured into unhappiness themselves.

Cond Nast/Wired is full of journalists/graphic artists/photographers.  They do not have any programmers.  They are clueless about how to handle programmers.   This is typified by them taking away your computers and giving you G4s and when you told them you needed to install programs, they said, Dont worry, we can get you Photoshop.
 
Hey, they need to be educated on the care and feeding of programmers.  Now presumably they bought reddit because they saw some value in it and in you guys; there is some reason they want you aroundthey want your expertise and they need your help to build these sub-reddits for their magazines.
 
So you have to go to Kourosh and educate him on what programmers needwhat hours they work (not 9-5), what kind of office space they can tolerate (not white noise and pink walls; maybe not in the Wired office at all); how they need root access, etc.; how they cant work with Big Brother looking over their shoulders every moment.  If he wants you to be productive for the company and meet your goals, then he should be willing to arrange those exceptions for you (if you explain them clearly).  If not, then you guys arent going to produce much of anything.  Thats just the way its going to work under the current conditionsat least if Steve (and Alexis in NY) is as discombobulated as you seem to be.  Try not to be so stressed out; youll just make yourself sick.

Ah yes the soul-killing corporate environment.
 
Actually everything people have said above is true to survive there you have to toughen up, and as Mister Road Warrior (Ive been a IT consultant for over 10 years now. In that time Ive had to hike up Mt Everest barefoot with no supplemental oxygen, survive six months in the Amazon rainforest with only a blowdart and a Berlitz In-Flight Portuguese! phrasebook etc. etc.) so eloquently put it, a lot of people in the corporate environment are pretty miserable.
 
Mainly though, I suspect the people telling you to toughen up are primarily jealous.  Presumably you got a pile of cash out of all this which is all corporate America can ever offer anyone in the way of job satisfaction  cash.
 
Look at it this way, before you were flying solo, using your wits and your instrumentation to chart the best course and survive.  Now you are sitting in business class, and the plush seat and five course snack only serve to remind you that you aint up there in the pilots (or co-pilots) seat no more.  Which sucks, yes, but dont expect the poor bastards crammed in behind you stuffed nose to ass in the economy cattle class to give much of a fuck.  Similarly, dont expect the fat cats ahead of you in first class to understand your pain either, as none of them are interested in getting behind the controls of the plane and frankly dont give two shits where the plane goes, as long as their fat asses are well-cushioned, their gullets well-fed, and their egos well-coddled along the way.
 
So you might as well sit back, relax, and enjoy the rest of your flight or if you decide to jump out, make sure you strap on a parachute and take enough cash to go buy another airplane.
 
Just my two cents, best of luck to you, whoever you are, I just happened to see this and your anguish touched a chord.  Regardless of what anyone says, the first day in the office sucks monkey ass and frankly the most natural reaction in the world to such an environment is to lock yourself in the bathroom and hide.  I clearly remember my first day in the Corporate World.  I went home with a splitting headache and and with every sense numbed, feeling something had been taken from me and I didnt even know what it was.

Title: The Existential Terror of San Francisco
 
After I sold my company I decided to visit New York City one time before I moved out to San Francisco. The trip was a lot of fun, but at one point I found myself completely out of cash, my ATM/debit card snapped in half, my credit card deactivated for suspected fraud, and my phone out of batteries. Then I got off at the wrong subway stop and found myself deep in the wrong part of Harlem.
 
As scary as that was, it wasnt anywhere near as frightening as the existential terror I feel every day walking the streets of San Francisco.
 
When I walked through the streets of Manhattan, I saw residents going for a stroll or walking their dog or playing with their kids and I thought Ah, I could live here. But even while Im living in San Francisco I still cant quite believe it can be done. I saw a mother out walking with her daughter and thought What are you doing?! Dont you know this is no place for a child?
 
The whole city feels like some sort of movie set; oversized and fake. Every time I go out I worry that I might miss my mark or fumble my lines and on the rare occasions that I do, I am mercilessly excoriated by the city officials. When New Yorkers bark at you for screwing up, its because theyre impatient. But San Franciscans seem to do it much more frequently and with much more emotion. Youre not just wasting my time, their tone of voice says, youre insulting me with your stupidity.
 
Ive been to San Francisco before, of course, but always on very carefully planned excursions. Go to this place, take this subway, get off here. I realized after I moved here that this was the first day Id really woken up in the city and it was terrifying. I ran down the street to catch my train to work and (after getting barked at by city employees for waiting in the wrong place) found the train packed to the edges, with barely enough space for me to stand.
 
The city maltreats you even when youre not doing anything wrong. I tried to take a bus from the place I was staying to downtown one night and, after everyone else got off at earlier stops, the bus driver noticed I was the only one left in the bus and kicked me out before hed finished the route. Yeah, this is the last stop now, he said. Get out.
 
Of course the downtown district is a den of filth and vice, shops with names like Tenderloin Liquors and Adult Show Superstore with gangs of leering indigents sitting on every streetcorner. In Harlem, people mostly kept their eyes down and kept walking. Here everyone calls out to me, like a dark postapocalyptic scene from Blade Runner or A.I..
 
Of course, San Francisco isnt all pain. Every time I begin to think its too much to bear and that I have to get out of town now, it does some little thing to redeem itself. Im spit on by every drunk and transit worker, rained on from the entirely cloud-covered sky, splashed on by the busses refusing to follow their routes, but then Im wonderfully treated by the staff of the soaring San Francisco Library and then Im cheerful again until the next guy spits in my face.
 
One night, the friend Im staying with invited me to go with her to San Franciscos Midnight Riders and lent me a bike to do so. The bike was a road bike, which I didnt know how to use, and I didnt have a helmet. We sped down hills as I peddled furiously and met up with a group of drunk people (some of whom were also on cocaine) carrying axes (the theme was I Married an Axe Murderer) as we sped around the city, culminating at the pier, where some of them stripped down and jumped into the freezing water.
 
After that terrifying night, San Francisco didnt really scare me anymore, but it still felt wrong. Perhaps a movie set is a fairly safe place to actually be, but when you live on-stage its difficult to get any privacy. Having to live my life on stage in this dark, cartoony, mask-filled world seems like a more terrifying nightmare than anything an axe-wielding gang of cocaine-high bikers could do.

I know plenty of people who felt their existence threatened most of the time in NYC but are for the most part happy in the crappier parts of the Mission. Maybe you look too friendly/peaceful and get grief because of that?
 
I also think most cities suck when you first move to them.
 
Kudos for publicly declaring that SF isnt perfect. Most people are too hip to do that.

Well Aaron, now weve completely traded places. Since I spend a lot of my time wistfully remembering the good things about San Francisco, and harping on Boston, it helps to be reminded of some of the negatives.  Its true that San Francisco has an attitude problem. Big time. I cant say that the angry Massholes I occasionally run into are much of a delight, but the psychological dysfunctions of San Francisco do seem more universal and widespread.

My recommendation would be to hang out around the nice parks: Dolores, Duboce, Alamo Square. Im sitting in Duboce Park Cafe right now and was struck by how magical this place can seem sometimes (and not in the movie-magic sense). Id also have to say that any event involving more than 4 people on bikes is asking for disaster. Ive never lived in NY, but based on what other people tell me, its far far less livable than SF. I second what danny-dan said about this place not being perfect, but I cant really imagine a better place (at least in the US) to be.

Since you liked Boston critical mass so much, you should try SF critical mass.  I havent been, but I hear nothing but good things about it.  (well, except for bad things that you wouldnt consider bad  because if you did, you wouldnt have enjoyed Boston critical mass either).

It sounds like you hang out around the tenderloin and on market around 6th st, which are about the worst parts of the city outside of bayview.  As dannydan said I spent the better part of last year a stones throw away from those parts on shotwell st.  Walking home at night it was like night of living dead, with everyone stumbling around on crack.  But there were also mothers and babies, mostly hispanic, which [should] make one realize that many people are not fortunate enough to choose their surroundings.
 
Anyway, you might just not be a city person.  Most people I know that spent any time there hated palo alto, and spent every waking moment wishing they were in the city.  As a suburban kid myself, I find the experience of living in a neighborhood where everyone has Bush/Cheney signs on their lawns and enjoys their walled-up all-white exurb to be terrifying itself.  But thats just me.
 
Btw, if you think San Francisco is bad I really dont think youd like brooklyn, where the liquor stores are seedier AND the cocaine bikers more pretentious.  In fact, as Dave Chapelle has noted, a quick BART trip to oaktown might give you a fresh perspective on your sf environs.

I would have to agree with the prior commenter. This feels like pure fiction to me  a desire to have a nice blog post thats written like fiction. Come on, how many people really spit on you? Ive lived here for 18 years and its never happened once.

It feels like you were writing this post while walking around instead of living there in the moment.

Aaron, where in the world are you living? Ill certainly agree that the Tenderloin is unpleasant, bus drivers sometimes mean (and sometimes surprisingly nice), and the SF attitude annoying in different ways from Mass-holes, but I cant express how easy it is to avoid the nastier parts of the city in favor of the beautiful, warm parts.
 
[Subtext: You should have moved in early Sept., so you would have had two months of beautiful weather to move in with]
 
Have you spent much time in the parks? I quite like Duboce and Golden Gate, of course, both of which are easy to get to on the N-line [dont even get me started on how much better the Muni is that the T].
 
If youre looking for streets without hookers, try anywhere west of Market other than the loin. In particular, Id expect that youd find the Inner Sunset (9th street, really) quite reminiscent of Porter/Davis.

Of course there are millions of stories in the naked city  all of them different.   San Francisco is small  not a giant behemoth like NY  it is scaled to a single humans size  you can walk in one day from one end to the other  try it, youll love it.  Start downtown  go down Market street  turn down Height to Golden Gate Park  walk through the park to the beech  spend some time at the museum or One Dog Night, if its still there  walk back  or take your sleeping bag and sleep in the park or on the beech.  Next time go the other direction  out Stockton  spend some time in upper Grant Avenue  through China Town to Fishermans Wharf  dont be afraid of the street  nobody is going to hurt you.  San Francisco is a town small enough to swallow  almost whole  bond with it.  If you look at it straight on, with no tremble in your eye, what you see will be a surprising contrast to the awful isolation of suburbia.  Like NY, San Francisco is alive, yet still small enough for a single man to thoroughly tread with his two feet  or at least it was a couple decades ago.    Btw, congrats on reddit.

Hi Aaron,
 
Ive been to SF before and I know how you feel.  A lot of my friends live in the East Bay and take Bart over to SF for their jobs.  Anyway, if youre not too keen on living in SF, maybe head over to the East Bay and check things out.  Albany, El Cerrito and Berkeley are all pretty mellow compared to SF.  Ive lived in the Berkeley area for about 10 years and I really like the atmosphere that comes with being close to a University.
 
On a completely different note, if you get a chance, you should try watchingHaibane RenmeiI think you might dig it.
 
Anyway, good luck with your new job. If things get really crappy, just quit and go to school at Cal.    :-)
 
Regards,
Steven

Although I understand the different reaction to both cities, I find SFO orders of magnitude a much more congenial city than NYC: IN SFO you naturally flock to people with similar ideas, people are friendly even when confrontational, and although no supermodels (as in NYC), it also means fewer supermodels. Yeah, that is a bummer.
NYC was always hostile, always fake and trying to show off. SFO can not be more boring with all its political correctness, but it has all this brainy weight to it that enamors me to it.
Although, I must say, SFO is always thinking about its next Big Earthquake. Now that is its existential terror.

San Francisco is not the place for anyone to live if you plan on having a family anytime soon. its great if you are single but then again SF is becoming more single every year as well as more unfriendly to families. i suspect a lot of this has to do with the overwhelming general perverseness, homosexual and immoral culture that is seeping into every corner of the city and this includes everyone in the judicial system there.
 
Now, not even innocent little kids and their parents can make up their own mind as to joining Junior ROTC. i could write a book about how wacky the whole political and cultural landscape is there but i dont need to since many have already talked and written about it.

I walk through the Tenderloin every morning on my way to the work shuttle. Its generally the worst part of my day. I hope your lease is short because I think you should consider finding a better neighborhood.
 
If you are working in Soma, consider living in North Beach or the Haight or the inner sunset or inner richmond. Heck, I like the Richmond district so much that I bought a house there but its hard to see my friends who live in the Mission because cross-town transit is poor here.
 
Generally, anywhere thats less than 20 minutes downtown by Muni/BART would probably work out better than living in the TL.

Yeah, SF can be full of self-appointed officials who want to tell you what to do and how to do it. I remember one encounter with the Cool Police back when I lived in the Lower Haight in about 1992. I was walking home one evening, returning from a job interview, wearing khaki pants and a white shirt. About a half block from my flat, a teenage punk in a spiky mohawk grabbed me and said, you cant walk down this street dressed like THAT, youll get killed! Yeah right. I told him I LIVE on this street, do YOU? What I should have said was, hey that mohawk was really cool.. back in 1977 when I had one.

Youre insane. Youre also probably projecting your own insecurities onto the city around you. Ive lived, worked, or partied here for all of the past ten years, and my own experience was that when SF was unfamiliar, it was chaotic, beautiful, and endlessly inviting. When it grew familiar, it did so like an old glove.
 
The Tenderloin is indeed a dump of epic concentration, but its just a few square blocks, surrounded by perfectly acceptable (and even quite posh) neighborhoods on all sides, and home to some of the best indian & south asian food Ive ever had.

@SFO - the comment definitely wasnt directed at you at all. I think what youre bringing up is unrelated to Aarons terror. A terrifying city isnt family friendly, but an unterrifying city isnt necessarily family UNfriendly either. =)
 
I dont know if SFO is family unfriendly. I have friends happily bringing up kids here, and the weekday afternoon latte-toting Noe Valley mom with stroller and golden retriever in tow is a familiar cliche, so someone must think its a good idea. Obviously if youre the kind of person who thinks that all gays and singles are immoral perverts, then youre going to prefer the family-friendliness of a Walnut Creek ranch home and a two hour commute. ;)

Aaron, you remind me of my suburban friends who used to tell me how awful New York was.  When I asked them how on earth they got that impression, the answer was always the same: well, I drove into Manhattan, and [insert horrible car-related story here].  Taking public transportation in San Francisco is asking for pain.  Those of us from real cities who moved here have learned to love it despite that flaw.  Ive lived here 14 years and can hardly imagine living anywhere else.
 
In time youll come to see the error of your ways: either youll lighten up and start enjoying the good life, or youll get fed up and leave.  No biggie either way.  But thanks for the funny and entertaining flashback to the culture shock I felt in my first few months in town!  Really takes me back.  Ah, to be young again.

You are polarized. You will attract what you feel because that is how these things are. Instead of having a bad thing happen and putting it behind you, you dwell on it and it attracts more, which attracts more, ad infinitum. It works both ways, expect good and it will happen. BTW, I was with Midnight Riders, and you, and they are what you paint as some sort of gang from The Warriors. Kids having fun, drinking, not on coke. They had paper axes for spoke cards and learned the song from So I Married an Axe Murderer so they could do a jig. It was harmless fun with some skinny dipping. Loosen up and allow the world around you to be itself and see the good and fun in it. It will despise you if you despise it. It will love you if- oh hell, whats the Golden Rule?

Title: Meeting Peter Singer
 
I remember watching an episode of Penn & Teller about animal rights. As usual, the show mostly consisted of a long series of clips relating to animal rights, followed by comments from Penn making fun of the idea. This show, I recall, was particularly weak. They didnt even pretend to make an argument; it was entirely mockery.
 
Watching this, I couldnt help but realize there was a powerful logical argument at the core of the animal rights groups: animals should be treated much the same way humans are  their lives should be respected, their pain minimized, etc. Make this one simple change to your system of morality and everything else falls into place. PETA actually seems kind of measured when they refer to the Holocaust on your plate.
 
Peter Singer is the moral philosopher who has probably done the most to promote this idea. With a wide-ranging career spanning from Marx to meat, his book Animal Liberation, which quietly and thoughtfully makes this case, is widely-regarded as launching the animal liberation movement.
 
I was recently dragged to the Boston Vegetarian Festival to see Singer speak about his new book, The Way We Eat, and was deeply impressed by his thoughtfulness and clarity of mind. An aging fellow with thoughtful glasses, he looks like Noam Chomsky, another plainspoken professor. He is not a passionate activist who has taken on the cause of animals, but simply what he appears: a moral philosopher who started thinking about the issue one day and drew the logical conclusions.
 
After his talk, a woman in the audience asked a question about the rumors that he would sometimes eat non-vegan food. The audience was scandalized. Let me address that, Singer said. I dont believe in veganism as a religion. I simply believe that refraining from eating animal products is the most effective way of putting pressure on producers to stop abusing and killing animals. Sometimes, if a host misunderstands my request and makes non-vegan food, instead of throwing it away, I will eat it. I dont think this is a problem, because I dont think this does any moral harm.
 
Another person asked how he could say good things about Whole Foods when they were still serving numerous animal products. Whole Foods has the best standards for animal treatment of any major organization, he replied. Thats simply a fact. And, I think its a good thing. Do I think not using animals at all would be even better? Of course. But I praise people for the good things they do and condemn them for the bad ones.
 
A final question raised the incrementalism versus revolutionism debate common to all left-wing social movements. Should one really worry about animal treatment when the animals were still going to be killed? Pinger said the answer was undoubtedly yes. Look, I thought that when Animal Liberation came out everyone would read it and become a vegan. But its been thirty years and vegans are still less than 10% of the population. If you genuinely care about animal suffering, you have to admit that, and say, what else can we do to ease animal suffering?
 
After Singers talk, I began thinking through the consequences of his morality. A question occurred to me: Should we also stop animals from eating each other? I was sure others had made such arguments as reductio ad absurdums of vegetarianism, but I thought I might be the first to be genuinely interested in it from a moral perspective.
 
Of course not, said my friend. Its not our fault if the animals kill each other. You mean, I said, that you think its perfectly moral to let that guy  I pointed at a random guy nearby  go around killing people? Well, OK, he said. But its different with animals, because they dont know any better. You mean it would be OK to let him go around killing people if he was mentally ill and didnt realize he was doing it? You should go ask Singer, he said.
 
So I did  he was signing books outside the lecture hall and as the line ended I asked him my question. His answer was even better than I imagined: We would if we knew how to do so without making things worse and disturbing the ecosystems and so on. Thanks! I said, impressed. He spied the large white book I was hugging to my chest. Are you reading Kolakowski? he asked. Yep, I said smiling. Had to read that when I was studying Marx a long time ago. Its heavy, he said. Quite literally! I replied, hefting the 1200 page book. He smiled.
 
I have to say, though, I said, feeling guilty, that I dont agree with your Darwinian Left stuff. Thats OK, he replied. You dont need to agree with everything I write. Then he wandered off, looking for the next thing to see.
 
I had to get that off my chest, because it was the one thing bugging me about Singer. Somehow later in life Singer had become a sociobiologist, one of that vulgar group of psuedoscientists who insist  despite all evidence  that humans are genetically programmed to do all everything a right-wing politician could imagine. (Sociobiology having gotten a bad name, they now call themselves evolutionary psychologists.)
 
In his book A Darwinian Left, however, Singer explains that this is no reason for the left to despair. If people are actually born stupid, thats only more justification for left-wing policies. We need to provide the stupid people with the extra resources to live on equal terms as the smart people. Steven Pinker cites this book (along with Singers The Expanding Circle) several times in his execrable Blank Slate to prove that his noxious views arent necessarily right-wing. (Neither Pinker nor Singer, of course, provide any real evidence to show this actually is the way humans are.)
 
That said, as usual Singers conclusions do follow from his premises  if you do make that one small change to the way you think the world works, then his conclusions about what we should do to remedy it undoubtedly follow. I just wish hed check his assumptions.
 
That aside, it seems unfair to dismiss Singer on the basis of a small blemish on an incredibly long and varied career  Wikipedia lists over forty books hes written or co-authored. His thoughtfulness and clarity in sharing it is an example to us all.

Whats wrong with evolutionary biologists? I assume that all theyre saying is that certain immoral behaviors are also characteristics likely to get passed on to young. I really dont see how its any different to say Humans can be irrationally jealous about sex because irrationally jealous humans tend to have more children, than it is to say Cats have sharp claws because sharp-clawed cats can kill more mice and thus are more likely to breed.
 
I think the exact term for Singers dietary ideology is Meagan.

Evolutionary psychologists say quite a bit more than that, but lets just stick to that example. Its nice to sit and make up stories about how cats got their claws (Rudyard Kipling has a nice book called Just-So Stories about how the leopard got his spots and so on). But this is childrens book writing, not science, which would require some evidence. Evolutionary psychologists just come up with stories to explain why theyre jealous without even bothering to look into whether everyone is just like them. Thats just propaganda.

Im jealous. If I still lived in Cambridge, I definitely wouldve like to have met him. Just last week I was discussing various theories of altruism and was drawing increasingly large circles around the self, kin, tribe, nation, etc., with respect to social parochialism and drew the largest expanding circle to include Singers arguments for animals.
 
I always appreciated his consistency in argument, and his pragmatism. If I remember correctly, the interaction on veganism is much like his position on vivisection. While it might be immoral to experiment on animals, that shouldnt prevent us from improving the protocols for animal experimentation while it is done (i.e., Britain is much better at this than in the U.S.) Here, all you have to do is allude to cancer and you can torture animals regardless of efficacy.

Oh, I see. Your problem is with the data theyre trying to explain, rather than with the explanation itself, then? Im not sure: I think their argument goes something like this:
 
1) Some people will lie/cheat/steal/rape/etc. if they can get away with it.
 
2) Some of them get away with it.
 
3) Those who get away with it expend less effort for the same amount of food/shelter/progeny.
 
4) Their progeny are more likely than the rest of the population to inherit these antisocial tendencies (whether through genes or memes).
 
5) More kids due to trait + kids more likely to have trait is the classic Darwinian recipe for proliferation of a trait.
 
Its fair to say that traits exist and can be handed down from parents even if these traits dont exist for everyone and dont always get handed down: Evolutionary biology is useful if theres correlation, even if it isnt 100%.

This is the best I can come up with for Liberalism from First Principals:
 
0) You (a human) have been sold 10,000 ideas about how to be happy, and how to avoid negative judgment.  Push back against them all, and notice most fall away with absolutely no substance.
 
1) There is a high probability that you can be happy and healthy, and still have enough time, energy, and resources to do meaningful work for any cause you wish, because of the freedom you gained from pushing back (in step zero).
 
2) Pushing back against insubstantial ideas about happiness and avoiding negative judgment is not consistent with any particular progressive cause, but is definitely inconsistent with working slavishly to preserve the current human power structure.
 
I wish I could wave a magic wand and create pervasive tolerance among, between, and throughout all people who are disinterested in working slavishly to preserve the current human power structure.
 
Conservatives are typically marked by cohesion and tolerance among members of their own group, and progressives are typically marked by incohesion and intolerance among members of their own group.
 
My guess is that a progressive, tolerant of all other progressives, is a politically unexploitable creature.  So it is attacked from all sides with no fear of reprisal: attacked either for fun, sport, or for purpose.
 
I am interested in the necessary and sufficient conditions for human politics to arise.  What sources would you suggest for researching this?

Its only armchair wankery if it doesnt provide a viable answer to an existing question. Evolutionary psychology hypothesizes an answer to the question of why people have an inclination to do bad things; we can (probably) test it by comparing the honesty of people across different cultures. If its found to be valid (Im not an expert  perhaps its been confirmed, perhaps not), well have evidence that people will tend to be more moral in the future if theyre compelled to be more moral now.

Unless you consider natural selection a powerful enough theory that, for a given feature in nature, there almost must be an adaptation explanation for it (our ability to discern anything whatsoever from fossils depends on this assumption, so I assume youll buy it). Then just-so stories, if they are falsifiable, are simply theories. Thinking up theories isnt wankery, is it? Generally you think of a theory, think of some predictions, and then go test it, no?
 
Going back to animal rights: I am not convinced that everything with a nervous system places an ethical burden upon us. What is your justification for this premise?

I dont think any scientist believes every trait is adaptive. There is also exaptation and pure randomness.
 
But the bigger problem is that the evopsychers seem to think the Scientific Method includes an alert the national media phase between coming up with a hypothesis and testing it.
 
As for animal rights, I wasnt making any arguments in favor of the premise. But if you want to read some, perhaps you should get Singers Animal Liberation which many people seem to find convincing.

Aaron, you dont know much about sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. Youre attacking a caricature. Go read a bunch and then if you still disagree with it you can attack it. But sociobiologists emphatically do not believe humans are genetically programmed to behave in the way you describe, and one of their first principles is avoiding just-so stories, so the fact that you attack the field for those things says to me you dont know the first thing about it.
 
I never finished Animal Liberation but I liked what I read (Im a vegan so Im entitled to skip the tedious arguments, heh). But I thought A Darwinian Left was one of the most brilliant small books Ive ever read.

I am interested that the objections to evolutionary biology, at least as expressed here, seem similar to fundamentalists objections to Darwinism  its just a theory, wheres the evidence, there are holes in the theory  and, as far as I can tell, for some of the same reasons, namely that it lessens the stature (in this case, moral) of humans to the nature of animals. And that the objections are being made by people who admittedly have little expertise in the subject. And that its used to further a theory  in this case, conservatism, that the objectors object to, hence its the agenda rather than the theory that seems to be in question.

Title: The Meaning of Borat
 
For this weeks Sunday Bonus Post, Im reprinting a note I sent to some email lists.
 
I went to see the film Borat last night. To be honest, I didnt really enjoy it as entertainment as much as I thought I would. Nevertheless, I thought I wanted to correct a common misconception.
 
A lot of people seem to think the movie is just making fun of stereotypes. Borat is a sterotypical foreigner, his victims are stereotypical Americans, and the humor comes from laughing at them. There are perhaps a couple short scenes where this might be true, but its a pretty small part of the film.
 
In reality, Borat is about the existence and enforcement of cultural norms. In place after place, Borat goes somewhere and does exactly what youre not supposed to do. By doing so, he demonstrates exactly what our cultural assumptions are, makes us laugh uncomfortably at their violation while we start to question their legitimacy, and then documents the punishment inflicted for violating them.
 
There are scenes where he questions feminist dogma, provides a brilliant critique of nationalist rhetoric, violates norms about racial integration, takes superstar-worship culture to its logical conclusion, and, in my favorite scene, deconstructs the fake niceties of the television interview (something Ive always dreamed of doing).
 
This is an incredibly tough kind of humor to do, because watching people violate cultural norms is so challenging. Were ingrained from birth with an injunction to follow the rules of behavior in such situations and violating them does not come naturally. (A Japanese friend said that watching the film was actually painful in parts.)
 
Even though, as I said, I personally didnt enjoy the film as much as I hoped, I still think that its an important project. Challenging cultural assumptions is incredibly tough. If you just criticize them outright, people think youre weird and dismiss you. And if you violate them yourselves, you suffer the social punishments. But its a very worthwhile cause; Im glad to see someone receive so much success for trying.

Your post failed to mention why you think challenging cultural norms is an important project.
 
In a number of cases, I agree with this in principle. But you should fill in the blanks as it was your missive.

Hi all,
I guess that it is time to start explaining better instead of just criticising something for free.
We all know that there is nothing free. So, if a film wants to publish a critic about something (specially if it belongs to a public culture or way of expressing) it should explain from where is that critic comming: is it from a bunch of Borgs that hate communication or all kinds of ideas that didnt come from their boss? did it origin in some traumatic experience? 
Anyway, people might buy these critics, and perhaps, for free. But what they are really buying is their own insatisfaction and insecurities. 
And after we all finish studying our reasons to laugh or talk, we might surely end laughing about the old times when we used to live spontaneously.

Anthropologist Grant McCraken has two essays, where he provides similar analysis  http://www.joegrossberg.com/archives/002790.html  his remark that Borat is about boundaries was particularly salient.

Yes, lets discard all social norms  only then will the world will become a much more sensible and livable place!
 
One way to interpret peoples reaction to Bort is that theyre stupid, unimaginative dolts who deserve scorn.  Another is that theyre people confronted with one or more generally unacceptable social behaviors and try to find some more or less graceful resolution of it without creating offense.
 
In the end, its not clear to me that Bort isnt the ignoramus, albeit one whose cleverness lies in acting like a jackass for the amusement of other ignoramuses.

Borats cleaverness is making us cringe about aspects of his culture, then showing us that our culture is closer to his than we think hidden behind a layer of pretence.
 
Eg.  Americans cringe at Borats fear and loathing of the Jews then Borat exposes the fact that many Americans have a similar fear and loathing of terrorists and muslims.
 
Eg.  We cringe when we hear Borat putting down women to the feminists and the American boys laugh at Borat when he falls out of love with Pamela just because shes not a virgin.
Then Borat asks why the American boy doesnt call the girls after having sex with them because I dont respect them, man!!!  Just the same, after all.  The double standards are exposedso much for men and women being equal.
 
Eg.  The Southern Society people try their best to accommodate the different culture Borat comes from. but order the black prostite out of their house.  No tolerance there!

Borat is a very disturbing film the attempts to confront the cultural issue of acceptance from the perspective of humor. For instance, the Southern dinner table scene where the dinner party was accepting of his rude comment about the Pastors wife, and the idea about eating with disabled  peope at dinner table, and even the bag full of feces. But when the issue turns to accepting Borats African American, provacativly dressed prostitute friend. The jokes over, and they are told to leave. The idea of tolerance and acceptance ring consistantly in the movie to show that many of the social norms are hippocritical and racist. Finally while chasing the socially concocted vision of beauty (pamela Anderson) Borat comes to find beauty in the darndest place. Borat makes pokes fun at he melting pot of American culture and and shows that its not really melting just mixed.

Title: Life at the Office
 
It started when he stopped going home. The rent in San Francisco was so
expensive and the commutes so painful that it just seemed easier not to
leave. Nobody really noticed at firstthe cleaning crew came in around
7 and just assumed he was staying late, while the other employees just
assumed he was an early riser. And really, whos going to complain about
an employee who puts in too much time at the office? Especially when he
wasnt using it to get additional work done.
 
Then he started wondering if he could eliminate the trip for food too.
He found a website that sold nutritionally-balanced diet bars and
ordered a whole tub, which he placed under his desk. All day hed be
munching on one bar or another, no longer feeling hungry around lunch or
dinner. So he just sat at his desk munching instead. Strangely, this
didnt seem to make him any more productive.
 
Between the lack of exercise and nonstop eating, he began growing fat.
Nobody really said anything to him about it. He was rail-thin when he
started so many co-workers were secretly happy to see him put on a few
pounds. But it quickly got out of hand, with rolls of fat oozing between
the cracks in his Aeron chair. Still, nobody wants to insult a fat man,
so he just continued to grow. He never really needed to leave his chair
anymore, so he didnt mind it much.
 
Soon he beganIm not quite sure how to describe it, I guess he was
sort of fusing with the chair. The rolls of fat would sneak through a
crack and then continue growing, like vines crawling through a gate. It
quickly got to the point where he couldnt even get out of the chair if
he wanted too, the fat had locked him in. He could still roll around the
office on it but that movement quickly became tiring and as he grew
fatter the wheels snapped off.
 
Nobody really seemed to mind, though. He had become an office
fixturepeople came to him now. Hed chat with them about their day or
keep an eye on things for them. Since he was always there he knew
everything that went on in the office and people could always rely on
him for gossip or signing for their packages.
 
Soon it seemed like he was part of the office itself, like some sort of
roboreceptionist you read about in Negroponte novels. Desks began subtly
organizing themselves around him and employees began treating him as
just another office fixture. Theres the bathroom and theres the
kitchen and theres, well, you know
 
And then, one day, they left. Some corporate restructuring or something;
they were all being moved to a different building. People packed their
stuff in boxes, cleaners cleaned one more time, and then suddenly they
were all gone. He was all that was left, keeper of an office without any
officers.

Title: The Millionaires Ball
 
She stood out, you had to admit that. In a crowd of people in suits and eveningwear with nicely-combed hair and demure smiles, she stood out as if a spotlight was shone upon her. Which, come to think of it, might well have been the case. Her hair was purple and spikey, her clothes ragged and flopping in all directions, one layer upon the next, each going inside and outside the other in a mockery of the very concept of layers.
 
She must have made her money in the dot-coms, he figured. That was the way the odd ones broke into the club nowadays. In the old days the new money was made through theft and abuse of office. Now any random computer programmer  or even the people who hung around them  could find themselves saddled with a pile of cash. What was that new site hed read about in the paper? Something about teens talking to their computers selling for a billion dollars?
 
Not that he minded, really. The place needed some new blood.
 
He strode over, straightening the lines of his suit as he did so  a habit, he quickly realized; in this case the gesture seemed a bit superfluous. She was standing by the wall, fiddling with her drink, looking cautiously out at the surroundings. Hello? she said tentatively, unsure if the tall handsome man was really speaking to her. Hello, he said in a deep gentlemanly voice and bowed. There was an awkward moment or two as he stood kneeling at her feet. She wasnt sure what she was supposed to do here. Then she kneeled down as well and looked at him conspiratorially. Maybe we should get out of this place, she whispered, grinning.
 
They both stood back up and glided to the door. He helped her into the car and had the driver take them back to his place, one of those buildings for the wealthy in the center of Manhattan. Hello Jeeves, he said to the butler at the door, before they begun dashing up the stairs. Is his name really Jeeves? she asked him. Oh yes, he assured her. We made him change it.
 
They quickly reached his room, a stark and modern affair that nonetheless managed to signal extreme wealth. They fell into designer chairs and he removed his coat. Would you like a cigarette? he asked. Oh yes, she replied. He removed a green piece of paper from a box on the shelf and rolled it with tobacco. He handed one to her and offered her a light before taking one himself. It smelled funny and as she removed it from her mouth she saw why  it was a crisp one hundred dollar bill.
 
He saw her eyes go wide as she looked at it and laughed. You dont burn money where you come from? he asked. I have to admit, she said, the idea had never occurred to me. Oh, its quite enjoyable, he said, removing the entire stack of hundred dollar bills and lighting it on fire.
 
She stared at the flame, unsure of what to do. On the one hand, she was aghast at the wastefulness of the thing. But at the same time it was somehow incredibly alluring. Lighting money on fire  it was like pornography for the rich. Her eyes went wide and he leaned in close for a kiss, the flames still dancing behind his head.
 
What else do you do? she asked, entranced. Well, we could flush some down the toilet, I suppose, he said, but Ive got something even better. Jeeves, ready the car, he said into the intercom on the wall, before dashing down the stairs again.
 
The car dropped them off along the water. She wasnt quite sure where; her sense of the city wasnt particularly good. They strode, arm-in-arm, breathing in the elegance of the moment. Its wonderful, she said, but I dont se. Just wait, he assured her. They saw a cop up ahead, strolling towards them, and in plain view he walked over to a building and ripped a small statue straight off and presented it to her as a gift.
 
The officers face hardened. Sir! he insisted. Oh, officer! he said, as if he hadnt noticed him before. How good to see you. You cant be stealing things right off of buildings, the officer said gruffly. Oh, you know I can, he replied. I can do much more than that. The officer looked increasingly angry. Ill give you ten thousand dollars, he said, pulling out his checkbook, if you take off all your clothes.
 
The officers eyes darted back and forth, unsure of what to do. But when he saw the check, he begun complying. He really could use the money. She laughed and he whispered in her ear. She smiled and begun looking through her bag. Smile! she cried when he was done and snapped a picture. He saw the officers eyes go wide and seized the moment to grab his clothes and toss them into the water. They both begun laughing. The officer tried to avoid crying. What about my check? the officer pleaded. He begun to hand it to him, before snatching it back and tearing it in two. He tossed it into the air and then they pivoted and walked away laughing.
 
They headed back into the car to one last stop for the night, pulling up outside some nightclub shed never heard of. Attractive young men and women about their age were dancing to some heavy electronic-sounding beat. He got up on a table. Excuse me, he said, excuse me! I have here a check for one hundred thousand dollars. Come over here for a chance to win it. They all stopped dancing and came over. Now he had them in his paw. He made them jump for the check, then he made them get down on their knees and bark for it like dogs. And they complied  a hundred twenty-somethings in trendy clothing, all down on their knees barking. Shed never seen anything so funny in her life.
 
He did a few more rounds of this before finally tossing the check into the middle of the pile. Everyone lunged for it as he climbed down from the table and made his getaway. Was it a real check? she asked. Oh yes, he said, but by the time anyone gets it itll be torn to shreds.
 
Back at the apartment he lifted her off he feet and tossed her onto the bed. He climbed on top and begun untwisting her layers of clothing, both going at each other ferociously.
 
She woke up the next morning, lying next to him in bed. He was smiling, gazing at her face. She was racked with guilt. Look, she said. Theres something I have to tell you. Im not who you think I am. He gazed into her eyes, slightly puzzled, and she was about to explain when they heard some scratching at the door.
 
He jumped up, just in time to be standing nude as the police burst in with bulletproof vests and guns. Mr. Januski, one shouted, youre under arrest for the creation of counterfeit US tender and check fraud. They cuffed his hands behind his back and begun dragging him away. Wait, he said, youre not even going to let me get my clothes on? No, said an officer, who he soon recognized to be the one from last night. Now lets go. They dragged him out the door as she sat there in shock.
 
Finally, she got up and put her clothes back on and then set about going carefully through the room, tossing everything of value into her purse. When shed done a thorough job, she locked the door behind her dashed down the stairs. Goodbye, Jeeves, she said, as she exited the building.

Title: Robert Walker, Road Warrior
 
Robert Walker was the consummate road warrior. A decade out of college, but still single, his job as a salesman required him to spend his days traveling the country, making his pitch before assembled audiences of respected businessmen. Robert had never been one to get too attached to any place or person, he enjoyed the life on the road, remaking himself in every new location.
 
Since he had no one to come home to, he threw himself into his work, volunteering to take more and more days on the road, until the road itself became his home. Every place he went looked the same after all: the same white airports, the same chain stores, the same business types in the same suits. He felt he was getting to know the neighborhood and developed a routine: Wake up at the Westin in the morning, grab a coffee at Starbucks, head to the office to make a pitch, grab lunch at a Cheesecake Factory or a Chilis, do another pitch at an office, then catch a plane to the next Westin.
 
Chain culture became his culture. Aside from the commute by airplane, it could easily pass for just another job. He eventually let the lease on his apartment lapse, his suitcase becoming his only possessions. Soon he got rid of that too, adding the task of picking up a new pair of clothes as Banana Republic to his nighttime rituals. He felt freer, knowing that no matter where he went, the world would provide him with all his favorite things. All he had to do was show his credit card.
 
He realized the credit card was the only part of the wallet he was using  it got him his e-tickets at the airport, paid for his clothing and his meals, reserved the room at his hotels  so he chucked the rest of the wallet and carried only that. He decided to chuck his cell phone too  he had the head office call him every morning to tell him where he was to pitch to next.
 
Now he truly felt alive. A man with a card  that was all he was  yet the world bowed before him, ministering to his every want. The people he interacted with started to seem different to him. No longer were they simply service workers, doing their job to get their pay. Now they seemed like servants, bowing before him in obeisance to his power. Have a nice flight, Mr. Parker, Enjoy your meal!, Thank you, sir  it all now sounded like genuine emotion to him. It sounded like love.
 
Yes, that was it, he decided. The world had finally come to love him. The parents who never supported him, the girls whod quickly abandoned him, the friends who were never there for him  well, he now had the last laugh. The world now catered to his every whim, fitting his desires like a well-tailored glove. And all he had to do to get it? He simply had to train himself to want what it provided.

Title: The Early Days of A Better Website
 
A reporter asked me to describe what the early days of our startup were like. Heres my response.
 
In the early days of Reddit, there were four of us crammed into a dingy little three-bedroom apartment (I slept in a kitchen cabinet). Every morning wed wake up and stumble into the small space that I think was supposed to be a living room, where wed placed desks along all four walls (Steves wall had a small window, with a beautiful view of the wall of the next building over, just a couple feet away). The sky would be gray, the floor would be filthy, and wed be three feet floors away from the rest of the world. Looking back, its hard to see how we got any work done. Actually, looking back, Im not sure we did.
 
Aside from the filth, my memories of those days mostly consist of an unending series of petty annoyances and frustrations. Its hard spending your working days in such close quarters with other people. Its even harder when you spend your nights there too. And its almost impossible when youre all high-strung socially-awkward geeks.  Tensions frequently flared.
 
Not that there wasnt a lot to get flared about. There were always bugs or complaints or new features you just couldnt get to work. And when you finally got the site working fine, a new storm of traffic would overwhelm things and youd be back to picking up the pieces, making it run faster and more reliably.
 
There were lots of problems, but somehow we got over them. Take a nap, walk the fifteen minutes into town to get some food, go across the street to the abandoned playground,  or, when things got really bad, just look at that ever-growing traffic graph. We must be doing something right, we figured, or at least not doing much thats particularly wrong.
 
While behind the scenes work was a disaster, in public things were going great. Every time we went out, more people seemed to know what Reddit was. We started selling Reddit t-shirts and people wearing them and recognizing started to pop up over town. One fan, on a short trip to Boston, even made a pilgrimage to our apartment and stole the Reddit sticker off our door. (We only found out where the missing sticker had gone when he bragged about it on his blog.) Reddit heads started appearing on more and more weblogs and sites I read started talking about Reddit as if they assumed everyone already knew what it was.
 
At parties, the awkwardness of trying to tell people what we did for a living (We, uh, build a website. You know, its kind of a news-type website.) gave way to recognition (Oh yeah, Ive heard of that site.), and then to profuse thanks for a great time-waster. Towards the end, actual introductions became unnecessary  people started recognizing us and coming up to say hi.
 
When I went home to visit my family, my dad insisted on setting up a meeting for me with a magazine publisher he knew. I was sure the visit would be a disaster  why would a magazine publisher take a punk kid like me seriously?  but once she heard our monthly visitor numbers, she was eager to start a partnership. The same scene repeated itself over and over.
 
Even when people had no idea what we did, the traffic gave us confidence. Once we won a free meal at a restaurant (actually, we won at least three different times) in exchange for suffering through a short lecture about financial planning opportunities. As the man talked about being sure to put money away for a safe day, we looked at each other knowingly. Either wed sell big or blow up entirely. Staying safe just wasnt in our vocabulary.

Well, to be honest it seems he really didnt have much ideas behind for Infogami, but probably for some reasons, it had to show up once at least, set up and run ,but bound to be abandoned. It is clear now that Infogami didnt have much or even few plans or visions behind. It was a wiki but he didnt declare it is wiki, and it really didnt even come near to be a blog platform. His relation with users seem managed just ad hoc, no policy or anything.
 
Otherwise it is hard to imagine why it was run that way, and abandoned in such way, and why no other option was pondered and chosen.
 
Writing can be an effective tool for sculpting and concealing. Many becomes dependent on it for its effectiveness at doing such.
 
Or there might be something more nuanced among Reddit team and it might show up. Two original founders seem almost wordless, not much explaining, silently just doing people. So.

For the sake of fairness and accuracy, Aaron only slept in said kitchen cabinet for a few nights.  We had proposed converting our pantry into a bedroom for him, but when I returned from a weekend away, he had arranged some cushions inside of the cabinet.  The vast majority of his nights were spent in a shared room with Steve  on a bed, a nice one, in fact.
 
I did take a photo for posterity, though, and I must admit that it makes for a good soundbite :-)

Title: Mr. Millionaire
 
While Im moving Ill be running old tortured-psyche fiction pieces. This one was written in August of 2005, shortly after the first Summer Founders Program ended.
 
I kiss my girlfriend goodbye before walking down the front steps into
the waiting cab. We whir towards the airport. Ive done this so many
times that the whole act becomes some sort of choreographed dance:
step and lift and pull the suitcase, slam the car door and run towards
the airport. Wave my card at security and take the express lane.
 
Onboard the plane, I grab my business class seat and push the seat all
the way back, just to remember how it feels. I try to get some sleep
but all too soon were there. I grab my bag and head to pick up my
rental car. I toss my luggage in and pretty soon Im speeding down the
beautiful California road.
 
Ah, Mr. Delboy, says the receptionist. Weve been expecting you.
She leads me to a conference room. I take a seat at the tip of the
long table, which stretches all the way down the room, before
stopping at a mahogany bookcase whose shelves remain empty. A
fluorescent light gives everything that yellow glow. Three older men
sit on my left, three older men sit on my right. Lets get down to
business, Mr. Delboy, says the first man on my left. Please, call me
Jules, I say. Weve talked it over and were willing to offer three
million.
 
I lean back in my chair and laugh. Three million? I say, turning
serious. Please, I could find three million in my fucking couch.
Dont waste my time with this stuff. I begin to get up. No, wait,
cries the first man on the right. Will you take five? I sit back
down again. Ten, I say. Five and a half, he says. Ten, I say.
Well have to discuss it.
 
Back in Massachusetts, I head over to visit my friend Lou. Also a
programmer, he was laid off six months ago by a local enterprise
consulting company. Judging by the mounting pile of beer bottles, hes
had a rough time of it since. He plops down in the couch,
absent-mindedly flicking on and off the TV. FOX News pops on. God, I
hate these twits, he says. And the spineless Dems are no better, he
adds. I recently got this fancy-schmancy direct mail survey from them
asking what I thought the most important political issue was. There
were all the usual options: Iraq war, social security, health care,
outsourcing  but what about the poor, man? What about those people
whose lives really suck? They keep trying to railroad politics into
this safe little issue-oriented bullshit. When is real change going to
happen?
 
So, uh, my company is going well, I say, trying to change the
subject. Yeah? he says disinterestedly. Yeah, we got offered five
but Im trying to push them to ten. Thousand? he says. Million, I
say. Fuck, man, he says, a million dollars? You have any idea how
many mouths you can feed with that? Hey man, dont try and pull that
hippy bullshit on me, okay? Im as liberal as anybody. I donate money
to MoveOn.org, I read Nickel and Dimed, Im totally with you on that
stuff.
 
Shit, Jules, you dont even know what that stuff is. Do you even live
in the same world as these people? Five million dollars? Can you even
think of what that kind of money means? I mean, sure, to you it means
another jet so you can go galavanting around the world but do you ever
think about the people that youre flying over? Shut up man, Ive
got serious stuff to worry about, I dont need to hear your whining.
I look over towards the overflowing mountain of beer bottles. Get
some help, I say and walk out.
 
Im walking through Harvard Square when my cell phone rings. Jules here,
I say. Alright man, weve discussed it and were willing to give you
9 and a half. With what vesting? I say. 5 in cash, 4 and a half at
three years quarterly. Three years? I say. How about two? Deal,
they say. Deal, I say. Well fax over the papers tomorrow. I snap
the phone shut and keep on walking. Its a beautiful day in Cambridge.
The sun streams down from overhead, casting a special glow on the
minstrels who inhabit the Square and making the colors pop on the
tight-fitting tanktops the coeds wear. Jugglers are tossing rings on
my right. Change please? calls a hunched over black man on my left,
with his battered Starbucks cup extended. I keep on walking but he
leaves his perch and starts following me.
 
Hey man, can you spare some change? Anything? Please, I need to eat,
he says. I keep walking, but I cant shake him. He gets in front of
me, starts pushing up in my face. Hey man, I see what youre wearing.
Look here  I got myself a total of three bucks, fifty-seven cents.
What do you have? Huh? I say. How much money do you have? I stop

bucks and how much do you have? he repeats. Five, I stammer, and
then it hits me. I crumple to the ground and start sobbing.
 
I cant take it, I sob. Im not cut out for this world. I dont
want to be in this world. I dont want to be this person. I dont want
to be me. I curl into a ball and start sobbing.
 
The man with the Starbucks cup backs away and heads back to his perch.
And the rest of the sidewalk traffic just keeps on moving, ignoring
the sobbing millionaire, lying in the middle of the street.

Title: Everybody Tells Me So
 
I remember when I was in fourth grade, while we were eating our snack (graham crackers and milk) in the kitchen, my classmates began discussing the effects of wealth. Money doesnt make you happy, I insisted. I tried to argue the point, but no one else believed me. (The same class was later adamant that Clinton should be impeached, although they did spontaneously throw an anti-fur-coat demonstration.) Of course money makes you happy, they insisted. Just wait, when youre rich, youll change your mind.
 
I havent.
 
On TV, whenever a kid is given a to-him-large sum of money, the fatherly adult handing it out says Dont spend it all in one place. Dont want the kid blowing it on a single movie and then feeling bad that he spent it all. Someone emailed me the same thing the other day, and I had to laugh. I dont really know how to spend the money period. How could I possibly spend it all in one place? Donate it to the UN?
 
A friend told me to be sure not to let the money change me. How could it possibly do that? I asked. Well, first youd buy a fancy new car. I dont know how to drive. Then youd buy a big house in the suburbs. I like living in small apartments. And youd start wearing expensive clothes. Ive worn a t-shirt and jeans practically every day of my life. And youd start hanging out with different people. Im so shy I dont even hang out with the people I know now!
 
For months, every time we thought wed really gotten somewhere on the Cond Nast deal, wed get a call from Paul Graham. Dont get your hopes up, hed say. Deals fall through. Whenever we passed him on the street, Deals fall through. In emails, Deals fall through. It got to the point that Alexis put up a photo of Paul Graham and captioned it Deals fall through.
 
I got an email from Paul Graham the other day. Ok, he wrote. Now you can get your hopes up.

Youve gained two resources:  money and time.  You have more chance than most of us to maximize your self actualization.  Your money opens up more doors that most of us wont even be able to get our hands on the knob.
 
Its up to you to find the creativity to take advantage of those two resources.
 
Travel to places that well never get to, meet people wed never be able to meet.  Help those well never be able to help.  Start a new company that attempts to change the world.  Try to fix the education problem.  Anything but whine about how unfortunate you are now that you have money.

Money can buy you freedom and freedom can buy you happiness. I agree.
 
In fact Id argue freedom one of the main reasons hackers start startups. I cant picture Steve Wozniak taking orders from some bureaucratic wacko telling him what to work on. For some reason I bet that even if he had had millions in the bank before Apple, hed still have worked on the same projects he worked on. But money does not only buy freedom to its owner. Money if in the right hands, brings great things to humanity. No, Im not talking about some donation to the UN. Im talking about the crazy scientist and the hacker in the t-shirt that are able to start new open source projects, buy better equipment to run experiments  and because these people are not subject to the bureaucracy of academic/industrial research, new inventions take place that would otherwise not have existed. So yes, my advice is, look no further. Get books, get developers, create your own mini-research lab for that matter theres no need to spend the money in the traditional way. Good luck man!

Theres lots of advice here about how money and free time are great ingredients for happiness. But wheres the evidence of this? It sounds like hopeful speculation to me, by people who have never had as much time, money or freedom as they think they need.
 
Somebody in Aarons situation has a tougher challenge than most, because hes got too many choices. Read Barry Schwartzs The Paradox of Choice to get a better idea of just how difficult of a problem this can present.
 
And Aaron, the good news is the book also talks about how you can protect yourself against the dangers of choice. And hes like  your surname soul-mate :)
 
My impression of you from reading your writing is that you are vulnerable to lifes emotional threats, but that you appreciate a good scientific analysis, and are willing to apply techniques that will give you the upper hand. Good luck!

The same [fourth grade] class was later adamant that Clinton should be impeached, although they did spontaneously throw an anti-fur-coat demonstration.
 
Fer crissakes, wasnt anything in your life ever normal? When I was in fourth grade I barely even knew who was president (a pre-impeachment-hearings Nixon). I vaguely knew there was a war going on somewhere, but only because the kid (as I now know he was - at the time to me was a grown up since he had just graduated high school) across the street from me got sent off to, what I later realized was, Vietnam.
 
I dont really know how to spend the money period.
 
You could find that homeless kid you met in the subway station, who was giving you the story about his mother losing all their money that she kept in her car which ended up getting bulldozed (or whatever the tale was) and give it all to him

Oh, forgotIt would be nice to have a ballpark on what you received for the reddit sale - just so we can tell whether you really are as clueless and arrogant as the past few days posts seem to imply, or if this is just an attempt at satire, or perhaps some kind of social experiment you are running.
 
You dont need to publish a copy of the ATM bank statement that you printed out. Just indicate whether it is an immediately life changing amount, or if it will mainly provide a nice nest egg at retiement if wisely invested now.

How do you think someone in his early 20s is supposed to take something like this? Hes human man for gods sake. What exactly are you going to achieve with your post? Change a clueless arrogant guy into something better? Get a life.

Hey Aaron,
 
I agree about money not making you happy. Ive met people in other countries who had absolutely no money, but always smiled and were some of the most friendly people Ive ever met.
 
If you are looking to donate some of the money, I would suggest putting it towards micro-finance loans, which go to entrepreneurs in developing countries to eradicate poverty at the community level. (See Kiva and Global Giving.) I recently inherited some money from a family member, and am looking to do something along those lines - there are people who will benefit from the money far more than I.

Money is just a symbol for resources.  Donating money to seemingly worthy causes does absolutely nothing, because money isnt what is needed to solve things like hunger or poverty - its people and the decisions they make.  Think about how very little money was needed to put together Reddit, and get it sold - seems almost absurd, doesnt it?  Well, thats actually how it tends to work.  Its not about money, its about resources/connections/power/etc.
 
Its obvious that you havent been exposed to a lot of things, because you will quickly realize that you live in a country with millions of millionaires, and the Reddit money really isnt all that much  Dont do the stupid thing and retire young or crap like that - go surround yourself with guys who are older and richer than you and yet still keep working on cool stuff; you didnt have access to the club before, but now that you have proven yourself and made a bit of cash, they will let you in.  You will learn that yeah, you take your vacation to the tropical island and buy the house you never visit in some distant location, but at the end of the day we are all just people, and people need a passion to keep them going - and it just happens to be that there is this group of people whose passions end up continually making them lots of money.
 
Find new problems to solve, save your money, and quit talking about it publicly!  You are in obvious need of a good banker to sit you down and explain how this shit works.  Email anthony.noto@gs.com and tell him one of Goldmans anonymous clients referred you to him - as a tech analyst, he will know what Reddit is and possibly who you are, and thus he might be able to get you a banking relationship there (and some sudden wealth therapy, which you may need).  Of course, this may be a lesson in learning that youre still poor - they usually dont care about people with less than $10m.
 
Oh, and dont date any American girls.  Youll just find yourself shopping for your first ex-wife.

Another concurrence, that Money doesnt make you happy - but it sure does increase the chances!
 
Aaron, I hate to say this, but its really clear that you have never seriously lacked for anything in your entire life. Nothing wrong with that, and Im not trying for radical-chic, and almost all people reading you are likely highly privileged themselves. But  youre writing as someone who already had enormous freedom, and wondering how it could be that even more freedom was going to make a difference. Lets put it this way - not many people are in a position to sympathize there and chime in with good life suggestions.
 
And youd start hanging out with different people. Im so shy I dont even hang out with the people I know now!

Aaron: I wasnt basing my remarks on that section, but rather other things youve written. I suspect there might be an issue of confusion between the aspects of wealth as a matter of relative ranking in society, and wealth as resources. That is, sociologically, as you know, many (not all, but many) people with much money are into status displays of resources as showing social rank (conspicious consumption - the fancy car, expensive clothes, etc.). Thus money => consumption => rank => happiness. You arent interested in playing in that game, intellectuals generally arent.  HOWEVER, though conspicious consumptions isnt happiness, its a huge and annoying (to other people) mistake to derive from this that available resources have no bearing on ones happiness.
 
Money wont buy you love (though it will buy various services, which may be a reasonable consolation). But arguments stemming from lack of money are frequent relationship-killers.
 
Money wont buy you health. But it will buy excellent medical treatment (yeah, yeah, there can be a negative effect of diseases of prosperity, but overall statistically its very clearly worth the trade-off).
 
Money wont buy fulfillment. But it will buy a lot of freedom to try. While that isnt hapinness itself, its generally highly correlated.

Stay away from bankers at large investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Smith Barney.  They will just want to sell you things you dont need.
 
All you need to know about how to manage your money, you can learn yourself.  It is actually much easier than most of the problems you spend your time on.
 
I recommend reading The Intelligent Asset Allocator, and optionally A Random Walk Down Wallstreet.
 
Im sure that you think it is selfish and childish to worry about how to maximize your new-found wealth, but really, it isnt.  The better you are at managing your wealth now, the more youll have to leave to charity later.  If you think that the right thing to do is to leave it all to charity right this minute, definitely spend a long time thinking about that first

Title: The Afterparty
 
It was Halloween, after all, so we donned costumes and headed to Harvard Square. (What are you? people asked me. I looked them straight in the eye, scrunched up my face to look a little angry, and said Im a dot-com millionaire with utter seriousness. That was my costume.) Alexis carried a sack of candy, Steve a sack of shirts. People in all sorts of bizarre costumes waited for the train.
 
We grabbed dinner at Border Cafe. Alexis handed out candy and shirts to the waiters while flirting, and offered to bribe them into voting for him in the Halloween costume contest.
 
I ordered a meal, but couldnt make myself eat it. The food just sort of seemed to stick in my mouth, each swallow painful.
 
So what are you going to buy first? someone asked each of us. When it came to me, I stared blankly. I couldnt think of anything I wanted.
 
Whos going to pay for the check? Steve asked. Oh, wait. I just realized, for the first time, that its relevant.
 
Afterwards, we walked down Church Street back to Harvard Square. There were a bunch of young girls loitering. Alexis struck up a conversation. Want some candy? Yeah! they all cried. He opened up the pillowcase. Want some shirts? Uh, sure, they laughed, and started fussing over colors and sizes. It was the strangest transformation, two mild-mannered guys suddenly become showmen, a horde of girls at their feet. Its times like these I wish I was a Vanity Fair reporter, I tell Chris.
 
Whats reddit? the girls asked as they tried shirts on. Oh, it used to be a website.
 
So why are you girls all just standing here? Were waiting for the Rocky Horror Picture Show! You should come. Oh. Well, we were going to go get crunked. Well, you can get crunked and then come see it!
 
We demurred and continued on, finding a flock of well-suited men, visiting from other countries, who fell for the same trick. Ill have to give this to my daughter.
 
As we walked to a bar, we passed three young girls in bunny costumes who Alexis tried to pick up. The oldest-looking one wanted to hang out with us, thought it would be fun, started giggling suggestively, a glimmer into a pasttime I didnt understand (my feeling is men suck, on both sides of the equation). But despite her best efforts, her two younger-looking friends shied away and wanted to just go to Rocky Horror. There was a struggle, and I saw the girls walking towards the bar and away from it several times after that.
 
By the time we finally reached the bar, my head was pounding and my stomach was nauseous, and I didnt want to go in, I didnt want to be here, I didnt want to know these people. I went home instead and watched a show about a serial killer and found myself identifying with the lead.
 
When I woke up the next morning, my head was fuzzy. And while I saw the costumes strewn about the floor, the girls brought home who slept in our living room, the odd emails asking me what Id do next, I still felt funny. For a shining moment in the morning, it felt as if this whole acquisition thing might have simply been a dream.

The surrealness of this whole thing has go to be amplified by the fact that it all came to a head on Halloween. Im sure many successful people share your ambivalence about the day everything changes.

Assuming this post isnt satire, Id say people are complaining because you sound too cool to feel happy about reddits acquisition. You have to admit theres some leverage in being unhappy: it implies that whats good enough to make other people happy doesnt have the same effect on you. Youre a pretty straightforward guy, so we can rest assured youre not acting a certain way for effect. Spend enough time with your local colleges hipsters and youll see the dance of people trying to feel more cynicism/irony/disenchantment than those around them.
 
It was the strangest transformation, two mild-mannered guys suddenly become showmen, a horde of girls at their feet. That sentence sounds melodramatic because I think youre exaggerating. You were chatting with some chicks on a street, not in the middle of a cocaine-riddled orgy. Maybe Im wrong; I wasnt there. It also sounds like youre talking smack about your fellow reddits.
 
If you rewrite this, I suggest you focus more on yourself and the emotional triggers for you wanting to disengage from the celebration. Reading your posts over the past few days has inspired me. You accomplished a goal without falling for the hype.

Title: The Aftermath
 
On Halloween, everything seems a little weird. You see a spider web and its not clear whether its real or a prop. You see a nun on the train and think it might just be a costume. You see girls loitering on the street only to find theyre just waiting for the Rocky Horror Picture Show. So perhaps thats why, when I logged into my bank account this morning and saw more digits in my balance than Ive ever seen before, I didnt feel anything in particular.
 
Yeah, its there, I said, to no one in particular. We called everyone to make sure everything went through okay. Did I get it? Did you get it? Did we get that? Everything checked out. Looks like were all done here, went the email from the lawyers. After months of negotiations for this day, it had finally come. I almost felt sad seeing the lawyers say goodbye. Almost.
 
I sat reloading TechCrunch, then wrote a script to do it for me. Finally the notice appeared, elaborating as time went on. Then I posted it to my blog and others to theirs. It started seeming real. Finally, I dashed downstairs to an ATM machine and asked it to print a slip with my balance. Would you like anything else? it asked. No, I said, and grabbed the slip. The numbers were big; the money was there. I started grinning and dashed back to the apartment.
 
But that excitement soon faded. Post after post, congratulation after congratulation, insult after insult. Friends emailed and called to share goodwishes. Reporters called to talk to Alexis and Steve. (No, thats A-L-E-X-I-S. Yes. Yes. Well, uh, its a news site.) Users emailed to send congratulations. How do you feel? everyone asked. I didnt know. How was I supposed to feel?
 
TechCrunch called to do a podcast, asked us to tell the listeners the story of how we got to this day. And it wasnt that anything said was particularly wrong, strictly speaking, but I walked away thinking wed given the wrong impression. Companies getting bought makes you think of lawyers in suits at conference tables signing papers. And while there were lawyers and suits and conference tables and papers to sign (oh, plenty of papers to sign), it wasnt really like that. It was more just a couple guys in a apartment typing on computers and talking on the phone.
 
I remember how when reddit started, the whole thing seemed so childish. The cartoony alien, the barebones design, the fresh-faced programmers, the rented house. And none of that has really changed. Its just that with success behind it, its harder to dismiss. A scribbled drawing a kid hands to you is cute, the same thing on the wall of a museum is art. You assume there must be something there, even if you cant see it.
 
Its hard to notice this when youre in the middle of it. During the days, I mostly saw my co-workers, who lived and breathed the site. At night, I hung out with my friends, who all knew what I did. On weekends, wed go to parties for local startups, who all wanted to emulate reddits success. Everyone we talked to treated us like it was serious.
 
But whenever I stepped outside the bubble, things were very different. At non-tech parties, Id have trouble explaining what it was I did. (So you, uh, have a web site?) Once I went far outside the city to have lunch with an author I respected. He asked about what I did, wanted me to explain it in great detail. He asked how many visitors we had. I told him and he sputtered. Ive spent fifteen years building an audience, and youre telling me in a year you have a million visitors? I assented.
 
Puzzled, he insisted I show him the site on his own computer, but he found it was just a simple as I described. (Simpler, even.) So its just a list of links? he said. And you dont even write them yourselves? I nodded. But theres nothing to it! he insisted. Why is it so popular?
 
Inside the bubble, nobody asks this inconvenient question. We just mumble things like democratic news or social bookmarking and everybody just assumes it all makes sense. But looking at this guy, I realized I had no actual justification. It was just a list of links. And we didnt even write them ourselves.
 
But thats not something you can say on TechCrunch. You can say a site is cool, stupid, popular, a flop, innovative, or clichd. But the one thing you cant say, the one thing that everybody skips over, is that these sites arent anything serious. And so when Michael Arrington told us that these stories of acquisition were his favorite part of the entrepreneurial spirit, I couldnt help but think that somebody was missing the point.

Aaron,
Is Reddit part of a bubble?  Yes.  I think so.  But that doesnt mean you should underestimate your accomplishment.  People want to find others like them, and you built a community that let that happen.  The value of trends may be temporary, but it is still value.  Congrats on the sale, on keeping your perspective.

Well Mr. Swartz, let me be the 234,590th reader to congratulate you. I gather you feel a little bittersweet about this whole thing but cest life. Maybe sites like reddit and digg will provide ideas for more serious sites to come. Maybe one day reddit will be a giant on whose shoulders someone will stand. One never knows. The thing is, why do you have to be serious to be able to make a living out of something? You guys are obviously talented and maybe your work is not space exploration or ending world hunger but you, entertain and educate to a certain extent through providing the means for people to interact and share ideas. Remember that the free-flowing of ideas is, or should be, one of the most basic tenants of modern life.
 
Maybe I am just talking out of my ass. Either way, a heartfelt congratulations from a reader in Panama.

Just sounds like youve got that day after the last night of the show thing (must be a name for it). Reddit is successful imo because it is a) useful and b) cleanly and tastefully implemented. Very little on the web is and I think theres plenty of space to do more of the same.

I see reddit as an extremely important social development on the internet.  Maybe you think this is silly, but sites like reddit will continue to dismantle the stranglehold the mainstream media has on content, and that makes us more free.
 
But I dont think you intended it this way, though reddit was obviously a great idea.  It has grown beyond you and beyond itself into an idea that will continue on other sites.
 
I was disappointed to hear that reddit had gone corporate.  But I understand that you are just a guy who needs a job, and are probably getting tired of working your ass off in your apartment.  In your shoes, many people would have done just the same.
 
And be assured that, despite selling reddit to a corporation, its idea will continue to flourish freely (as in freedom).
 
Ciao, enjoy California (isnt that where Wired is?).

Let me help you explain to your writer friend why Reddit is a great and popular site: Because its a distillation of most of the news on the web down to a simple white page; Because its a piece of cheescloth that keeps the links and filters out all the other crap;  Because its a beautiful weld without all the slag; In short, because its just a bunch of links not written by you.
 
BTW, I hope the new owners dont immediately start poking holes in the cheescloth.

Hey Aaron,
 
Breaking to new levels does feel unreal, especially when you realize that theres no magic, just focus and perseverance. In reality, business is largely fronting and strategy: igoring the fact that youre not big yet and looking for resources that can make you big. Talent and great ideas are mainly tools to support that.
 
You seem like a smart guy with good values now youve got the resources to do something really great, what will it be?

I find I have the same problem. When people outside of the scene ask me what I do for a living, it was hard to describe. It took me a while to figure out how to explain it.
 
Now, I tell them that I harvest souls.
 
I then go on to say, is that what I do, is try to get as many souls to register a piece of themselves with me. Once I accumulate enough of these souls, I can sell the whole lot of them to someone else.
 
Most people seem to understand this.

Aaron,
 
you built something that people find useful, presented it gracefully, and implemented it competently.  You underestimate all of the ways in which it is possible to screw up that simple equation.
 
If you never succeed at another venture in your life (unlikely, though possible), you will still have something to show for your time here, and that is more than many people can say after spending their entire working life at a soul-killing job, ignoring their wife and kids (if they have any), chasing after a pot of gold that will never materialize.  Why should you feel the need to justify your efforts?  As another reader pointed out, the justification is now in your bank account.
 
You can give the keys to the universe to a million men, and only one will unlock the door.  Most people dont even try to build something, let alone succeed.  Thats significant about your acquisition and the size of your audience.  The worth of your creation can be judged by the number of people who find it useful enough to visit every day, and the money which Conde Nast was willing to fork over so that they could make reddit their own.  An item is worth whatever someone else is willing to pay for it.  Perhaps your writer friend simply does not connect with most readers.
 
Go do something that makes you happy.  The point of having money is to obviate it as a motivating factor for your decisions.  I would hope that you wont dwell on justifying your existence for long; at the end of the road, the only person to whom youll need justify your choices is yourself.

Im a bit confused about why you find this hard to justify, though. There is a real engine behind Reddit, more than the bubble; its free content provided by users on the web.
 
Sites like Google and Reddit are about helping people to cooperate. Google does it very indirectly, through web crawling and link analysis, and Reddit does it more directly. Isnt that a wonderful thing to be able to say you helped people cooperate to enlighten or entertain each other?
 
I read something interesting or entertaining on Reddit every day. Your author friend cant say hes done the same for me, or for a million other people.

You said you hate newspapers. But this blog also doesnt have any book like persistence and consistency about why and what gets talked of or analyzed. It seems this is more of your newspaper than CWMills journal.
 
Ex: Instead of reddit, why you did not show this blog to the person you respect - in the first place?
 
Which is you? (of course you can have many yous) - Then there could have been real discussion about building the audience - between you and that person, and why its important and so on.
 
You could have started talking with that person about things closer to yourself, as a writer,  Raw thought(Blog) and Infogami - and Wikipedia - and Reddit.
 
0: PC and internet came into the world which had context or problems,
 
1: and the era of Webapps and how Silicon Valley ways use the hype phenomenon among youth/kids(look at recent WashingtonPost article about Myspace) ,
 
2: and when you came into the world, your upbringings and your psychological traits/inclinations, and what you really hope for.
 
Why you write? Why do you need to write?
 
And why Infogami had to be abandoned?
 
You should think about it and talk back to that author before leaving East Coast.
 
I kind of feel that author might needs or deserves explanation and perspective - about whats really going on - by just looking at how reddit gets praised and how that author gets quoted in responses and comments here.

Friends in Cambridge: well be hanging out at Border Cafe tonight.
 
TechCrunch (reddit): always played second fiddle to Digg
 
Reddit Blog: you all have made it everything that it is. A number of you even stuck with us after we switched away from Lisp.
 
E-Consultancy.com: suggest[s] that were in a serious period of inflation, though lets stop short of calling this a bubble.
 
Matthew Roche: the Avis Rent-a-car of the content voting sites.
 
David Weinberger:  a very very smart move by CondeNetif they let the Reddit folks heavily influence how the service is developed.
 
Blake Killian: Conde Nast, the unlikely Disruptor.
 
Bivings Report: just sort of scratched at the surface of what might be possible if traditional publishers embrace social technologies.
 
Digg: Reddit is where you go when you need someone to explain to you why North Korea is heaven on earth and America is the devil
 
Wired News: Users can also append negative votes to stories that are of poor quality or that fail to capture their interest.
 
Mark Pilgrim: a new form of online scam in which you make all the content, and we keep all the money.
 
Media Wire Daily: a clear sign that Charles Townsend is making sure that Condes digital dick is solid enough to swing with the big boys.
 
Matthew Ingram: No word so far on whether the rumoured price of $65-million has any relationship to reality
 
Gawker: merging with the ickle kiddies  the Nasties decided they needed more of that Reddit magic.
 
GigaOm: Reddit received 16 percent of about 300 votes cast, following Boing Boing and Gawker.
 
Valleywag: I went to their Boston pad, we played some video games.
 
Webomatica: digg gone through a Craigslist filter.
 
Slashdot: the great big Web 2.0 bubble continues to inflate towards the popping point
 
The Register: the price is many heaps smaller than the $150m that Kevin Rose reportedly wants for Digg
 
Joey DeVilla: I see that Aarons been keeping track of what theyve written about the acquisition on his blog.
 
ReadWriteWeb: Reddit is another to have been extensively profiled by [us].
 
Press Release: Reddit achieves our objectives on both counts, and we are confident that other companies will find Reddit to be a partner that can bring tremendous value to their Web efforts.
 
Marketing Shift: The obvious question to ask is if Conde Nast will allow Reddits rankings to remain neutral and not benefit the companys properties.

====================================================

Title: Up Against Love
 

 
When Laura Kipniss Against Love: A Polemic came out, reviewers seemed to have trouble understanding what it was about. Library Journal claimed it skewered our relationship foibles, the New York Observer insisted it was an incisive tract in praise of adultery, and the usually-reliable Salon called it a defense of adultery (twice!).
 
Against Love is a defense of adultery like Capital is a defense of playing hooky. No, Kipniss aim is to dismantle the entire social institution of, well, love  the notion that the right, meaningful, and deeply human way to behave is to find ones perfect soulmate by the time school ends and then spend the rest of your life living, having sex, and sharing your feelings with them. Kipnis thinks the whole thing is crazy, a justification for locking people up in domestic gulags.
 
Its pretty safe these days to get up and say our school systems are crumbling, our borders are shot, our government is a mess, our voting system is broken, or even that our economic system needs an overhaul. But try criticizing our system of love and all youll get back is stunned silence. Love is the one subject where no disagreement will be entertained, about which one truth alone is permissible (4). So criticisms, unspeakable in plain form, are disguised as the content of our comedy (take my wife please!) and the subtext of our films (The Stepford Wives, Rosemarys Baby).
 
Despite the fact that most long-term relationships fall apart, nobody suggests its the idea of a long-term relationship thats the problem. Instead were told that lasting relationships require hard work. So you go to work and put in some hard work and then come home and put in some more. Or maybe you spend more time at the office to avoid having to come home. Or maybe you channel your unfulfilled passion into shopping. Either way, capitalism wins.
 
We love to brag that weve achieved genuine freedom in our romantic lives, laughing at those barbaric Muslims with their arranged marriages. But is our system that much different? Careful studies find that people have a suspiciously accurate habit of pairing up with people with a similar level of attractiveness and wealth (although sometimes an excess of one can compensate for a lack of the other). And then they promise to live with each other forever, to working to make it work. Sure, perhaps you get a little more latitude in picking your partner, but is this system really that different?
 
Most people dont see love as a system to be criticized, but they do feel the social straitjacket even if they assume its just the natural way relationships work out. And they begin looking for an escape. Kipnis points to two: murder (lethal intimate violence  killing your lover  is so popular that theres an entire category in the crime statistics for it) and adultery (its popularity needs no statistics). Kipnis shies away from explicitly defending either (take that, Salon!), but she does suggest that adultery is a little bit of radical activism against the system, the critical practice of love.
 
She notes self-action generally comes before self-knowledge in these things; workers had walk-outs before they had unions. In the same way, the prevalence of adultery is peoples individualized attempt at escaping from love, each one sneaking out for an affair, stealing time from work at work and work at home to embrace their feelings.
 
But it isnt just capitalism, with its pro-love informercials and television specials, that tries to fit us to the system; the government gets into the act too. Politicians lecture us about family values, before sneaking out to cheat on their wives; states tie legal marriage to thousands of benefits, making submission to its notions of monogamy a prerequisite for perks. (Try to have several wives, like some folks in Utah, and youll find yourself in jail  not to mention the laws against adultery still on the books in 45 states.) And just imagine what it was like before no-fault divorce, when you actually had to prove to the government that you deserved to be unmarried, as if it were an injured lover refusing to let go once things were over (172).
 
Kipnis doesnt propose any particular solution; she just wants to ask the question. The book is written in the style of the postmodern bombthrower, with far more meat than most books of such form, although sometimes the styles excesses get a little too heavy. The books argument is studded with references to Freud and Marx and Marcuse, but done in such a flip and enjoyable way (and with thumbnail sketches of their love lives) that it feels like gossip, not scholarship.
 
But perhaps the best bits are the poetic descriptions of what its like to be in love, from how you find[] yourself so voluptuously hurtled into a state of possibility, a destabilizing, might-be-the-start-of-something kind of moment. [] that first nervous phone call, coffee, or a drink, orcircumstances permittingan incredible all-night marathon conversation (7) to the opening up required for relationship health [ which] will leave you feeling somewhat vulnerable, lying there psychically spread-eagled, exposed, and shivering on the examining table of your relationship (76).
 
The book is a tour de force of writing, but even if it was dreadful, itd still be worth it. What other book covers these topics, changes the way you look at love?

Is this a problem? Looking at my family dynamics and my own choice, most of us married at nearly exactly our own social strata (and worldviews even). This seems to be a stabilizing factor, as far as I can tell, reducing tension within and without the marriages.
 
Reading this makes me greatful for what I have. Im sad that many have never seen a solid, long-term successful marriage modeled for them, as it was for me by multiple couples.
 
I havent yet read her book - she does present some interesting points - but the whole perspective sounds inherently self-centered. What about the children?
 
How about thinking beyond oneself, to your childrens childrens children? How many Americans think about that? Is their stability important, or our societies? More important than self-gratification?
 
Not that thats easy, or anything. Just asking (postmodern bombthrowing).

====================================================

Title: What is Elitism?
 
This weeks Sunday Bonus Post comes from local genius Kragen Sitaker.
 
Upon reading an article that claimed:
 
[S]cience is hard. It is therefore inherently elitist, merely in this obvious sense: as with skateboarding, some will be demonstrably better at it than others.
 
Kragen saw fit to ponder the meaning of elitism. Kragen thinks of himself as an anti-elitist, but hes also very pro-science. How to reconcile the two?
 
Kragen begins by defining elite:
 
An elite is a small group of people who are distinguished from the majority in one of two ways: either they are better in some way, or they have more power.  These are distinct meanings, although apologists for established orders like to conflate them, and sometimes one leads to the other.  Sometimes an elite is distinguished by the mastery of a particular skill, such as skateboarding or mathematics, and sometimes by past accomplishments; but the much more common sense of the term today is to refer to a group of people who have power.
 
Elitism, then (according to Kragen) is the ideology that insists that the elite and non-elite reached their positions through intrinsic merit. (This belief might also be called meritocracy, but that is perhaps a less pejorative term.)
 
Ironically, the very article that begun this investigation appears to believe in this ideology. The article claims that textbooks, in trying to be democratic, lower their standards so that even the dullest students can comprehend them. Instead, the article insists, textbooks must be more elitist and teach real science, which is hard.
 
Anti-elitists like Kragen and I would agree that textbooks should teach more real science, which is hard. But we do not consider this elitist, because we do not believe that only a small elite has the capability of comprehending physics.
 
To anti-elitists, egalitarianism does not require lowering standards, since we believe more people can reach higher standards with more resources. But to elitists, this seems an impossibility. The only reason they are in the club is because they deserve it; to let others in requires bringing the requirements down.

Elitism, then (according to Kragen) is the ideology that insists that the elite and non-elite reached their positions through intrinsic merit.
 
This is a straw horse, making elitism a mere tautology. Im almost certainly an elitist, if not among the elite, but I recognize some set of people reach their influential positions through accident of birth or some other form of luck. (Less so under a meritocracy than an aristocracy.)
 
Anti-elitists like Kragen and I would agree that textbooks should teach more real science, which is hard. But we do not consider this elitist, because we do not believe that only a small elite has the capability of comprehending physics.
 
This begs the question. Lots of kids can comprehend physics to an extent, but theres no evidence that all but a few have the wit or inclination to master it. So the result will still be stratified, no matter how many resources you throw at the problem. True, part of this is because we dont have an unlimited need for physicists; lot of kids who may have the aptitude for it simply will never develop the skill.
 
It would be useful to identify yourselves as idealists. (Not that theres anything wrong with that.) E.g., youd be a far more effective physics teacher if you believe every one of your students can master the work, regardless of whether they will master it.

Title: Founders Syndrome
 
The simplest way to do something, of course, is to do it yourself. But theres lots of stuff to be done and not enough you to do it. You can get around this a little bit by finding friends who are interested in doing some of it themselves, but at some point youre going to have to start delegating, or getting somebody else to do it.
 
Now youre moving up in the world. If youre a decent manager, instead of running one project, you can run five or ten. Instead of simply directing your own labor, you can direct whole groups of people. Of course, itll still be people doing what you wanted, but  funny thing  people are smart enough that theyll begin to get the gist of things on their own and, if you do it right, your delegation will become an organization. You can disappear for a week and things will keep on marching.
 
But make no mistake, even those organizations are still following the will of their erstwhile founder. Even as they get big, they betray facets of the founders personality. The most obvious is in who is respected. My friend Emmett Shear has a theory that in each company only one class of people can be in charge and its going to be the class of people the founders are in. At Apple, for example, the UI designers are in charge, because Jobs obsesses over UI design. At Google, its the programmers, because Larry and Sergey used to code. Even though the founders arent directly involved in every project, their surrogates still win the day.
 
Now the problem comes when the organization wants to grow beyond its founder. This is most common on non-profits, where they even have a name for it: founders syndrome. See, once you have all these people carrying out your bidding, its pretty difficult to want to give that up. Maybe you can have them do more projects, maybe you can give them more flexibility in what they choose, but I cant think of a single story where the guy in charge voluntarily gave up his power. And that has a severe cost (which Ive come to calling the power premium) because giving up your power is often the right thing to do.
 
In non-profits, for example, your organization is probably made up of a bunch of independent-minded young people with a strong belief in democracy. These people arent too happy being told what to do all the time, especially when the instructions are pretty obviously not the best thing for the non-profits mission. So they rebel against the founder, and the founder tries to hold on to power, and things get very messy. (I dont know how things usually turn out in this situation. Maybe you fight until the founder dies?)
 
Less well noticed is that the same mistake is made by for-profit corporations as well, its just less obvious because the founder is the fellow holding all the cash, so you fight about it at your peril. But companies regularly do stupid things, even when if you asked all the people in the company about it they would have told you they were stupid. But in a capitalist economy, the founder has to maintain control.
 
But the power premium has a even more serious cost. While many people seem to be able to make the leap from doing something themselves to building an organization to do it, nobody seems to have been very good at taking the next step: going from an organization to a meta-organization, an organization that hires other organizations to do its work, rather than hiring people directly.
 
Why? Partly because few people get to be in charge of something the size of Google, where they need to take that next step to grow, and perhaps the trait of thinking that big is rare. But I think part of it is simply because the people at the top cant give up their power. Engaging organizations means youre no longer in charge of what people do or how they do it; the organizations have to be in charge of that. And that means youre no longer a delegator, but more of a moderator. Its founders syndrome at the largest scale.

I would guess that the reason why
 
nobody seems to have been very good at taking the next step:
    going from an organization to a meta-organization, an
    organization that hires other organizations to do its work,
    rather than hiring people directly
 
is because we have a very poor understanding of things as large
as an organization. We have no effective simplifying metrics for
understanding whole organizations. So we have no choice but to
throw them all into a big capital market, and watch where the
dollars flow. It is mindless and perverse, but at least it is
something.
 
Dollars flow into organizations that seem effective, pretty much,
and dollars flow out of organizations that are ineffective,
pretty much.  With a lot of dollars flowing in ways that are
perverse by any standard.
 
Also humans have a pack mentality.  Almost all humans:
 
Are most comfortable working under an absolute leader
 
Are most comfortable knowing at all times which people are
above them in authority/power, and which people are below
them in authority/power.
 
Would rather step in front of a bus, than take on more
authority/power than they think they could defend in
conflict.
 
And, if they are humiliated by asserting authority/power, and
then having it taken away by someone they previously
considered to be of lower rank, they will step in front of a
bus, or they will leave that hierarchy/organization
altogether, whichever is more convenient.
 
So, we see a bunch of command and control strictly hierarchical
organizations carelessly thrown into large capital markets, and
not much else of significance. It seems stupid, heavy-handed, and
inefficient, because it is stupid, heavy-handed, and
inefficient. But people prefer it that way, and the analytical
tools dont exist yet to do it better.

To mangle Arthur C. Clarke, When a distinguished but elderly intellectual states that something is flawed, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is the best we can do, he is very probably wrong.
 
Its certainly easy to say something is the best we can do, though. I notice you dont even bother to provide evidence.

Actually, he never said its the best we can do.  You need to reread it without the mindset of someone who is already convinced what arguments will be used against them.  He says that its stupid and inefficient but that most people seem to prefer it that way and the best one can say about it is that it is A method, rather than nothing.
 
I think the reason why things turn out this way is that large organizations have so many moving parts and get very complex.  They need a certain combination of hierarchy and freedom- varying based on their industry and their employees- that is tough to figure out, let alone implement.  There is also a problem with founders being given too much power for too long, as you point out.  But this is based on two things.  As long as the organization is relatively successful, the other shareholders dont know enough about the business to kick the founder out.  Theyre willing to let him keep doing what hes doing because hes the one who figured things out and built the organization in the first place.  However, founders do get kicked out by their boards all the time.  It only happens when the organization has some huge failure (say after the dot com bust when Yahoo brought in Terry Semel to replace the previous CEO and the founders stepped down a bit) but it does happen.
 
The other reason might be that because of the way things currently work, the founder is usually allowed to keep too much equity in the company for too long.  I think this is less important than the first factor because they usually end up with a minority stake after funding and the first reason than becomes the main one.  Also, if early employees bargain for more equity, the founder will end up with less, so he usually has more equity because he valued it more.  There are many founders who have tried to hold on to equity and then ended up with nothing when the company went bust, so you have to give the ones who maintain their stake credit for believing in the company.

When a distinguished but elderly
    intellectual states that something is
    flawed, he is almost certainly right.
    When he states that something is the best
    we can do, he is very probably wrong.
 
First of all, thank you. I have sometimes
been mistaken for being elderly, but never
before have I been accused of being
distinguished or being an intellectual.
 
I am 35 years old, and the consensus is I am
an undistinguished idiot.
 
Let me take one point from Ajay. A
corporation has some combination of hierarchy
and freedom. (Lets define freedom here as
social structures that confound hierarchy,
but are provably effective, as opposed to
plain anarchy or disorder.) Our current state
of understanding (from my limited knowledge)
is that we dont even know what a metric that
measures hierarchy/freedom looks like, much
less be able to calculate it, much less be
able to integrate it with other metrics to
get an idea of the predicted effectiveness of
an organization.
 
So we do what we can: we pay large amounts of
money to people who are good at negotiating
for themselves large amounts of money (and
maybe good at absolutely nothing else), we
let those people run our corporations, and
we cross our fingers and hope for the
best.
 
So we do what we can: we staff those
corporations with people who have never even
considered doing anything else but working
for the man.
 
So we do what we can: we throw all these
corporations into a large enough capital
market to hold them, and we watch the bucks
drift up and down, succumbing to a form of
manic-depression based on the stock ticker.
 
My current employment situation prompts me to
try and figure out better corporate
structures (on a small scale, bigger than a
hotdog stand, but smaller than General
Motors), but I have to be realistic about
the hard constraints.
 
Theoretically, a corporation could exist that
throws away hierarchy at the very instant
when it would be effective, and that shifts
authority and budget in an ebb and flow at a
tempo solely based on providing value to the
customer. Such a corporation could be
outrageously effective and profitable,
because it discarded so many non-value
added activities (politics, power games,
accounting games, etc.). But if your average
employee walked into such a corporation, they
would be scared shitless and hopelessly
confused on the first day. The capital
markets would be scared shitless and run
away, because there is no established body of
knowledge to demonstrate predicted
effectiveness of such a beast as this
singular corporation.
 
I have a solution.  I know the way.  I have a
written document that builds everything you
would need from first principals.  So do
200,000 other idiots.
 
Anyway, I am positive we have passed Peak
Sweet Crude Oil, and in less than 5
generations we will pass Peak Energy. Also,
more effective corporate organizations will
be developed in less than 12 generations. So
mankind will have no choice but to take them
up, kicking and screaming.

Aaron: noone does that because you cannot hire an organisation. You know the saying that loyalty is squandered on your company because your company will not be loyal to you? This advice applies only weakly to companies that are still small enough that they comprise a single social unit, of course, but that just reinforces the point: organisations are incoherent conglomerates of independent agents acting towards their own best interests, held together by some combination of money and the ambiguity of ideals. Unlike an individual, an organisation has no will or intent, and youre lucky to get its constituents all pushing in vaguely the same direction.

Actually Aristotle, organizations do have discernable intent; ask anyone what the intent of an enemy army is. We expect organizations to operate in the perceived interests of those who control them
 
But as for meta-organizations, could you (Aaron) clarify how conglomerates like General Electric fit in? How does GE differ from the meta-organization you have in mind?

I dont know the history of GE, but my understanding is that they bought those companies instead of developing them. A better example might be something like 3M, but even there theres lots of differences.

Tayssir: I had to think about your objection for a while. I am led to disagree. Armies appear to show coherent intent, because, well guess what would happen to a lone soldier who struck out on his own in enemy territory? There isnt actually coherent intent any more than anywhere else; the agents are still acting in their own best interests, but the nature of their environment is such that this leads to higher cohesion and more overlap in intent than is typical for other organisations.
 
Of course, every organisation has to display these characteristics to some extent in order to deserve the name; but there is no real coherence to the decisions and motions of an organisation the way there is to those of an individual. The example you picked works better than any other simply due to extremely reinforced command&control structures and due to the nature of the conditions under which it operates.
 
But even so, what does that mean? Where does it takes us? The implication would seem to be that in order to act more coherently as wholes, organisations need to be organised like armies colour me unconvinced that this is a good idea.

Great thoughts, much to ponder.
 
To your point on leaders stepping aside (the power premium): one example was George Washington, who, in the face of strong pressure to stay in office, set the example of two terms in office. He did so deliberately (c.f. letters and his message to Congress), and some say ensured the political stability of our nation in doing so.
 
I heard about a study into the nature of power this year - the conclusion was that holding on to power (such as a national leader) longer than ~8 years seemed to lead to a kind of inertia (or perhaps powers corrupting nature) that made it very hard to step down.
 
I work in a non-profit (one year now) that seems to actually be making that transition from founder > successor fairly well. A family business, no less - theres much less infighting and power struggles (I may have missed the fireworks, though). Theres a good plan for the power transition after the founders death (70s, but still strong!).
 
Interesting hypotheses, Ill be testing them.

Seems that what you remarking on is the following sequence: [laborer, manager, ], only you are stuck at the manager level. The following roles seem to me to be: director, investor, and politician and/or judge.
 
Directors of a corporation control its managers. Investors like Warren Buffet, control directors. Over them are politicans and judges who make the rules everyone must follow.
 
As one goes up the levels, more people are controlled, but the specificity (not necessarily the amount) of the control decreases.
 
What is amazing to me is the amount of raw power politicians have. They can force the most productive people in the most productive country in the world to hand over more than a third of their income to support projects controlled by them (the politicians).
 
How does the founders syndrome show up in politics? In our system, I would guess by endorsements and political parties.
 
In some sense, the Constitution and other law acts to control the power of politicians, and that is interpreted by judges.

Title: Google and the Gradient
 
For a long time it seemed like everything I heard about Google was even cooler than the last. Wow, its a great search engine! Wow, theyre not sleazy like other companies! Wow, they treat their hackers well! Wow, they are hackers!
 
The feeling peaked sometime last year when I was almost rolling on the floor hoping to work at Google. And I do mean peaked. Everything Ive heard since then has been downhill, each time I hear about it Google seems less cool. Im not saying the company is imminently doomed or that you should sell your shares, but I definitely dont think its going to get any cooler.
 
Google is run like a socialist state. Its citizens are treated extremely well. Theres free food, free doctors, free massages, free games, a limited workweek, etc. There are ministries to give projects free promotion and support. The government tries to avoid getting too much in peoples lives. And Google is always coming up with more perks to give away. (Theres also a strong class hierarchy, with abused temps and powerful acquirees.)
 
The problem with a system like this is that its necessarily a bubble. Everybody inside gets treated grandly, but the outside world gets nothing. Indeed, because of Googles notorious secrecy, they barely even get to talk to the people inside. A friend whos a prominent free software developer says that every community member whos joined Google has stopped contributing to public projects. Its so bad, he says, that theyre thinking of banning Google from buying a booth at their next conference. They cant afford to lose any more developers.
 
Which means that Google has to be careful about who they hire, but since theyre growing so fast they need to hire people as quickly as possible. Its an impossible bind  you can hire lots of people or you can hire really good people, but even a company as prominent as Google is going to have a hard time doing both.
 
The solution, of course, is to pop the bubble. Theres no reason being part of Google has to be a binary decision. Google has a wide variety of resources and while there are some they cant really give away to everyone (e.g. massages), there are others that should be easy (e.g. servers). Unfortunately for them, Googles mindset is so obviously set that this will never happen. Even a company as woeful as Amazon is already kicking their but in this space, giving away storage space and computer power, with more in the works.
 
But lets imagine you had the resources to do this right, what would you do? (I feel like Im giving away a valuable secret here, but since nobody listens to me anyway, I doubt it will make any difference.) The right thing is to build not a bubble, with its binary in-or-out choice, but to build a gradient, with shades of resources you make available as people achieve success.
 
So you have this organization dedicated to building cool web apps. The first thing you do is you start giving away free food in the middle of San Francisco. You have a nice cozy area with tables and bathrooms and Wi-Fi and anyone interested in starting a web site is encouraged to drop by and hang out. There they can eat, chat, hack, get feedback, get suggestions, get help.
 
Then you give them free hosting. Servers and bandwidth are cheap, good projects are invaluable. But not only will you host their app for free, throwing in servers to scale it as necessary, but youll pay them for the privilege of hosting. Indeed, youll pay them proportionately to the amount of traffic they get, in exchange for the right to run ads on it someday.
 
So now youve got all the bright, smart young things who want to start companies starting them on your servers, with clear and unambiguous incentives: get traffic, get paid. They dont need to worry about impressing anyone with their idea; anyone can use the hosting. And they dont need to sell out to investors anymore; as their traffic grows, youll already be giving them the cash to grow the business.
 
Most of these sites, of course, will probably be failures. But who cares? Sites that dont get much traffic dont use up much in the way of resources. Meanwhile, a couple of the sites will actually take off. So what do you do with those? Give them more resources.
 
Put your promotional team behind them to spread the word about the ideas. Have your web designers, database jockeys, and JavaScript hotshots help them fix up the site. Encourage promising young programmers interested in helping out with something to write a feature or two.
 
And  this is where the gradient comes in  as they become more successful, you give them more resources. Let them move into the apartment building above to food/hangout space, so they can get more facetime with fellow successful hackers. Give them free offices to work in. Provide free massages and exercise equipment. Have your PR team set up interviews with the major media. Integrate their site with your other sites. Plus, of course, theyre getting paid more for more traffic the whole time.
 
Some of the sites will be huge hits, another YouTube or Facebook. The founders will be raking in millions from the traffic. And at some point, theyll get tired of running the site and theyll let it go. Youll be there to take it over, slap some ads on it to recoup the investment, and give it to some new, junior developers to maintain and improve. And the cycle continues.
 
(Bonus for the truly adventurous: run the whole thing as a non-profit and have all the applications involved be open source.)
 
A bubble like Google can hire only so many people and theres no way of picking only the ones which will be successes. But everyone can be part of a gradient and the successes simply rise to the top. I know which one Id work for.
 
Thanks to Emmett Shear for discussion and suggestions.

But as a socialist yourself, wouldnt you rather work for a socialist state?  It sounds like you would rather work in a free market economy yourself.  Your argument against Google being able to pick the succesful web projects is exactly the argument that free market proponents lob against socialist planned economies, that it is impossible to centrally plan the economy and choose how to allocate everything from above.  Aaron Swartz, free marketeer?
 
As for your actual idea, there are probably legal issues that would make this practically infeasible.

I think this is a good business plan, and I think it would work better for some large host like DreamHost than for Google. Heres how they could do it:
 
First, create an ad service, integrated with the existing account system. As customers sell more ads, they can easily upgrade their hosting plan with the money already in their account. Next, as advertising revenue pickes up, offer more hosting services for cheaper, including free options. Then send out debit cards to customer-members, which only work at partner wifi-enabled coffee shops and restaurants who would advertise DreamHosters eat free. Finally, rake in the profit as customers become employees.

Everybody inside gets treated grandly, but the outside world gets nothing.
 
They get a pretty good search engine and many other good free services. And merchants and publishers get a pretty good ads system.
 
But I know you werent referring to this. You were commenting on the Iron Curtain between Googler developers and other developers. This is indeed sad and has many deleterious effects.
 
However, most of the benefit of your idea is already happening with AdSense. External developers, Google ads. Done.
 
The only difference is that youre proposing that 
Google should also allow outsiders to use its infrastructure. But for that to be true, Googles expected revenue from doing this would have to be higher than if they dedicated that machine to something internal. So far this is not the case. There are lots of other reasons why that idea just doesnt fly (yet) but thats the main one.
 
And, Google does support external developers in Googles Code Jams already. Thats more in Googles interest than doing the Google Startup Cafe.
 
Google believes it has lots and lots of internal roles to fill that would make them more profitable; thats why they are hiring like crazy.  They want to make money off the developers work, directly. They have no interest in helping people start a business and making money off them indirectly.

I think the best part of this idea is the place to eat, chat, hack, get feedback, get suggestions, get help. Hosting is dirt cheap anyway. The legal troubles that could follow from a more direct business relationship is not. The return for google would be a place to pick people to hire and startups to buy.

Just reread my own comment. I should have said Summer of Code, not Code Jam. Anyway, the point I was trying to make was that Google would rather audition developers to help grease the big money-making machine.

Neil says that Google should only let outsiders use their infrastructure if the expected revenue for doing this would be higher than if they used the machines internally. That would make sense, if servers were a limited resource. But theyre not; Google could easily buy more and do both.
 
Neil also seems to think that Google has better profit-making ideas than the entire rest of the world. Even Google doesnt think so; thats why theyre desperately wooing potential startup founders and buying companies like YouTube.
 
I agree Google isnt going to do this; I say as much in the post. And thats why theyre going to fail.

Im not sure whether this approach would work. At the beginning of the gradient, the stuff that Google would give away are very cheap: Sure, you give them free food, space and servers, but that stuff can easily be acquired with very little money. The only difficult thing to replicate is the companionship of other smart people, but if you have the right audience of people (as you or PG do), you can easily convince people to drop by a Starbucks location of your choice and spend about <= $50 / attendee / day, although likely not at Googles food quality level.
 
Once a company becomes successful, they would start moving up in the gradient. Now imagine that Reddit would be part of such a construct. Sure, Google gives you food and stuff, but at some point youll feel like youre being ripped off by Google - $50 / day. Bah, were giving our genius away for free! But when youre successful, you can easily get the resources you wanted yourself.
 
IMHO, ownership is actually a better way to go. The YCombinator model combines motivation and ownership and seems more attractive to me than the gradient.
 
Actually, you guys should use the profits from Reddit and invest in nice cozy tables and gourmet food. Gourmet food improves morale and doesnt make Google seem that great in comparison, after all :-)

Cool! Were already doing this in San Francisco with coworking. From the coworking wiki (http://coworking.pbwiki.com):
 
Coworking is cafe-like community/collaboration space for developers, writers and independents.
 
Or, its like this: start with a shared office and add cafe culture. Which is the opposite of most modern cafes. ;)
 
There are two coworking spaces in San Francisco, ones opening in New York City, Boston, Paris, and all over the world. All of this is being done by other interesting folks, in a grassroots sort of way.
 
The space Im involved in, the Hat Factory (http://hatfactory.net), we already have a great mix of people who come and work together. We have a bunch of the Drupal crew, the Civic Space guys, a tribe of leading video bloggers and videographers, and me, an open-source/Ajax/collaboration guy. Even though all of us used to work by ourselves from home or coffee shops, we now have more community around smart folks at coworking. You should join us.

Amazing though this may be (since no one seems to know what Ning was actually trying to do) this sounds a lot like what Ning was working on.
 * Host everything with the idea of eventually running ads.
 * Offer users help  in terms of free support, paid development, etc.  in getting their apps up and running. When you see popular apps, help make them better and more usable.
 * When users are succeeding, help them succeed further via promotion  front page, in site, external ads, etc.
 
So, I certainly dont think youre the only person who has thought of this, although perhaps Nings attempt was simpyl too constrained: You werent letting people take advantage of their natural and existing strengths, instead forcing them into a different framework, and really taking away a large part of the benefit of offering a shared space that the company could take advantage of.

Title: Somervilles Oddest Park
 
Behind one of the exits of the Davis Square T station is a small grassy area that connects the T station to a long trail that stretches from Medford to Bedford. (To accomplish this feat, the trail makes some bizarre choices, like going right through the middle of the cities busiest streets and public squares.) To all appearances, the area is completely unremarkable  some grass, a grate, a few pillars, an odd sculpture. But if you look up, a bizarre exhibit is laid out in the sky.
 
The pillars, you see, stop above eye level and then continue upwards with poles. Atop the poles are sculptures, model replicas of important Somerville buildings and things. And at the entrance, soaring overhead, where no one ever looks, is an enormous sign: Seven Hills Park, Somerville. And next to it is a large cow sitting on a compass.
 
The whole park is filled with this kind of gag. On each pillar is a sign describing the replica that sits atop it. One gushes about a particular buildings importance to the Revolutionary War, then describes what happens to it. First it was sold to a mental asylum (albeit one for the stars), then the asylum moved and abandoned it. Then the building was razed. And then the entire hill it sat on was razed and turned into a landfill. Every pillar has a story like this: important landmark, cut down by human folly.
 
Then there are the sculptures. The sculptures are life-size replicas of people in everyday poses  sitting on the bench, standing with their coat folded over their arm, and so on  placed right in the middle of things as if they were real. So the first surprise is that the people who seem real are really sculptures and that the sculptures arent set off with signs or space but thrown in with everything else.
 
So then you admire the happy poses of the sculptures before you notice another oddity: everyone in the sculptures is wearing a mask over their face. Still, the faces all seem like happy ones, until you look at them more carefully. A father appears to gaze down lovingly at the infant son in his arms, until you look more closely, and you see that hes not looking at his son at all. Hes staring at the ground at the gaze of love is really more one of wistfulness  hes imagining he was somewhere else right now; somewhere nice.
 
In another, two parents look down at their son in what first appears to be admiration but on further inspection is more like shock. And shock seems appropriate, because the kid who appears to be their son is dressed up in a bizarre costume of suspenders and is stretching his arms like hes about to go build a railroad. I still dont know what in the world is going on with that one. It freaks me out every time I walk by.
 
Its weird having sculptures you can just hang out with like this. You can sit on the bench next to a woman hugging her small child. And you can look right into her face, get right into her space, get closer than you ever could if she were real, analyze her gaze in far more detail than would be polite in public.
 
And perhaps this is the real message of the statues, and the park: Things are always much more complicated than they first seem, and you can see it if you look closely, its just that were all to busy to notice. Nobody ever looks up.

So a look of admiration is the same as a look of shocka loving gaze appears the same as wistfulness?
 
Sheesh, maybe you need to start spending less time hanging out with sculptures, and more time hanging out with people.
 
Or maybe just stop observing life, and start living it.
 
Then again, maybe I need to just stop judging people by a few paragraphs on a blog; stop assuming that is their entire life.
 
Hey! I think I just had a moment of growth. Thanks guy!

Sounds like youre describing the Minuteman itself, which ostensibly stretches from Davis Sq. through Alewife and out to Bedford, but which they extended eastbound slightly from Davis to Cedar St. in Somerville, where it ends abruptly in a bunch of weeds short of a merge with the commuter rail from Lowell. (I used to live on Ellington Rd., fronting that stretch.)  Anyway, its not like it matters to you any more! ;-)

Title: A Night at the Coop
 
This story is only what it is. It is not meant to be representative of any other experience.
 
The other year, when I was living in a cabinet, someone emailed me to ask if I had found a decent place to stay. Oh, dont worry, I said. Im sleeping outside the Coop.
 
For those who dont know Cambridge, the Coop is the Harvard-affiliated bookstore in the center of town. It has an odd sort of recessed entrance, that means theres plenty of outside-but-sheltered space to sleep at night and anyone who walks through the town late at night sees many (presumably homeless) people in sleeping bags taking advantage of it.
 
She didnt believe my claim for a second and ever since thats always irked me. Why is it so unbelievable that I might live beneath the Coop? Its got a fantastic location (Harvard Square is perhaps my favorite place in the world), nice atmosphere, and plenty of neighbors. Is a person like me living there really so improbable?
 
So ever since, Ive had it in the back of my mind that I would spend a night at the Coop. The opportunity finally arose last week, when I finally got my hands on a decent sleeping bag.
 
I made meticulous preparations. I took the bag and rolled it around in the dirt to scuff it up a big, so it didnt stand out so much (this really didnt do a whole lot, to be honest). Then I changed into sweatpants and a non-descript T-shirt. I left my shoes but put on a couple layers of socks, two subway fares and my keys. I buried the keys in a park by my house, spent one fare getting to Harvard Square, buried the other one inside Harvard, and then took my sleeping bag to a spot outside the Coop.
 
The digital clock hovering over us read exactly 10:00.
 
A musician was performing directly outside the Coop. He was quite good, sold a couple CDs, and encouraged people to visit his website. In between songs, hed make odd jokes about songs about his lack of a girlfriend. He chatted with a less coherent fellow on a bicycle who rode by sometimes.
 
There was a man in an orange jacket who really got into dancing to the music, before he finally took his place on a mat outside the Coop. Another man with a green sleeping bag turned in. I watched the big crimson flags outside the store wave, marvelling at their beauty.
 
Around 11 a whole group of kids blew through the square, seeming somewhat drunk and laughing. Little snippets of conversation could be heard.
 
Thats one odd thing about Harvard Square. If you sit at in the square and listen to people, you hear them talking about boys and homework. Meanwhile, I ordered breakfast once at a dingy little shop here in Davis Square, Somerville, and the girl behind the counter was arguing with the two older cooks about how the welfare policies of socialist countries affect their marriage rates, doing it as if it was the most natural thing in the world. After that, Harvard students really dont impress me.
 
Around 11:30 it was getting pretty empty and the musician began packing up his stuff. I didnt last much longer, so I laid my sleeping bag out along the side of the Coop and climbed inside. There were about five or six people on the other side, all tiled in nicely with each other, all in a different sort of gear.
 
I drifted in and out of consciousness for a bit, heard odd noises going past us on the street. Finally, I fell asleep around midnight (my usual bedtime), and didnt wake up until 5am when a subway train rolled underneath me. Everyone was still there, the day was still dark and quiet. I wanted to watch the sunrise but fell back asleep and didnt wake up until 8, by which time the sun had most certainly risen and everyone else had left. It had apparently rained overnight, because the ground was thoroughly soaked, and I tried to avoid the puddles as I went to dig out my subway fare.
 
It was right where I left it and I got onto the train without incident. My keys were where I left them as well and I managed to get into the apartment just in time for work.
 
What was so hard about that?, I thought.

Title: That Isnt Science!
 
Larry Wall once noted that the scientificness of a field is inversely correlated to how much the word science appears in its name. Physics, of course, doesnt have science in the name and is the most scientific of all sciences. Then comes biology and and ethology and so on. Then come the non-sciences like Computer Science and Poultry Science. And worst of all is Scientology.
 
In general, whenever someone tells you that science has decreed that you should do one thing or another that doesnt seem reasonable, its probably because theyre trying to pull one over on you, whether its the scientific medicines you see on late-night TV or the science of the behaviorists who say you shouldnt love your kids.
 
But nowhere is this more evident than when people try to tell you what science itself is. This field of meta-science seems to attract more charlatans and malintents than any other. If you control how the very notion of whats scientific is defined  well, then thats real power. Even if the very idea is patently absurd. (A real scientist would never tell you that doing X isnt really science; their goal is to get the truth, not sit around making rules about whos in and whos out.)
 
For much of the outside world, the test for a real science is falsifiability  the possibility that there could be evidence proving the claim wrong. This notion was invented by Karl Popper, who was himself an enemy of science who tried to insist that science never actually made any progress, that we never learned anything more about the world.
 
But even if we put aside this noxious pedigree, Poppers definition is still absurd. Take the distinction between astronomy and astrology. We would all agree, I think, that the first is a science but the second isnt. But both of their predictions are equally falsifiable  astrology makes a dozen falsifiable predictions in the newspaper five times a week. Poppers criteria isnt of much help to us, even on such a basic case.
 
Sadly, like many American intellectuals, the Supreme Court assumed that falsifiability was a standard scientific test. In the Daubert case it, as Chris Mooney summarizes the view of the American Journal of Public Health, blundered miserably and set judges the task of using this deeply confused philosophy of science to act as gatekeepers in keeping scientific claims from juries. Actual scientists like DefendingScience.org is working to undo this these mistakes, but you wouldnt know it from the rhetoric  after all, Dauberts defenders claim their just trying to uphold sound scientific standards. (Chris Mooneys book The Republican War on Science, among others, has a fascinating expos of the junk science/sound science notions cooked up by the PR industry to trash actual science. But thats another subject.)
 
What are the real effects, though? Daubert was a parent whose child was born with birth defects they believed were caused by the drug Benedictin which, in animal studies, appeared to cause the defects they were suffering. By making it harder for science to be presented in Court, these kinds of rulings make it easier for drug companies to claim theres no sound science that theyre hurting anyone.
 
America isnt alone, however. In Britain a group supporting what they call evidence-based medicine is trying to tighten restrictions on what experiments can be examined when approving drugs. Evidence-based medicine? Who could be against that! But again, theyre playing the same games. Behind evidence-based science are a bunch of very bizarre claims about what science is and isnt, taken not from doctors or scientists, but from econometricians (the subspecialty of economics that has to do with calculating things), which have quite a few problems of their own when it comes to the subject of evidence.
 
Under evidence-based medicine rules, doctors arent allowed to prescribe drugs on the basis of case studies and other reports; instead, the only real evidence are large double-blind random controlled trials whose results have a less than 5% probability of being due to chance. (Why 5%? No good reason. But according to the EBM people anything more than that isnt evidence.)
 
Again, you have the same negative effects: when someone tries to claim in court that a certain drug destroyed their life, the drug company can claim that theres no evidence to support this if the studies just happen to be 94% likely instead of 95%, or if theres only a series of case studies instead of a controlled trial.
 
This isnt evidence, this isnt rationality, this isnt science. Science is about trying to get the truth about the world, using whatever mechanisms are most effective at the job, whether youre studying the nature of planets in space or the nature of other cultures. When someone tells you otherwise, tries to insist that technique X or subject Y doesnt deserve the name science, its probably because theyre trying to pull a fast one on you.

The 5% cutoff for finding statistically significant results is a standard in statistics.  So they arent just making that up.  It goes all the way back to R.A. Fisher. Of course, he was just making it up. :-)

Im amused by the use of statistics in determining exactly whats true or not when the intro to statistics book Im reading explains that statistics will never tell you that. They will only tell you things like to what degree the data fits a hypothesis. Statistics is such an abused and misunderstood area of mathematics that I would say that anyone who isnt a professional statistician is 89% likely +/- 4% to be wrong about it. The book Im reading also explains how sometimes you just cant do tests like the ones they suggest. How do you do a double blind test of the effectiveness of birth control pills on human beings ethically?

A real scientist would never tell you that doing X isnt really science; their goal is to get the truth, not sit around making rules about whos in and whos out.
 
This claim is absurd. Real scientists tell you that doing X is or is not science all the time. In the US, biologists fight creationism. Scientists write books about pseudoscience or junk science and why its not science. Richard Dawkins has a new bestseller out on why religion is incompatible with science.
 
There is no contradiction between getting the truth and making rules about what (and who) is in and whats out as methodology goes for reaching that goal; the latter helps the former.
 
Its also absurd to say that just because you can falsify an astrological prediction in a local paper, Poppers falsifiability criterion is thereby refuted. Popper advanced the falsifiability criterion as a necessary condition for a scientific theory, not a sufficient one. I can make all sorts of falsifiable predictions (for example, which of my friends are going to marry or divorce over the next few years), and it wouldnt mean that Im basing them on a scientific theory.

I disagree with your point about astrology.
 
The whole reason people believe in astrology is not because they believe in the theoretical underpinnings of it.
 
They believe because the predictions are sufficiently vague that they apply to everybody all the time.
 
Ive heard a story about a prof who hands out personalized astrology readings to everybody in their class, and then has them rate how accurate the prediction is. Most people rate the predictions fairly highly.
 
He then reveals that everybody has the same prediction.

Creationism isnt simply a claim, its a movement. It has its own methodology, its own researchers, its own journals. Its methodology provides one of the main lines of attack scientists use when they argue that creationism isnt science, and falsifiability - or lack thereof in creationalist methodology - happens to be one of the primary arguments they use. For example, the claim that God created Earth 6k years ago - but did it with all the exact evidence that seems to show its much older (with fossils already in the ground, etc.) - is internally consistent. It is, however, unfalsifiable and therefore arguably unscientific.
 
Falsifiability is used all the time. Theres a current debate about string theory in physics with two books out, by Peter Woit and Lee Smolin, arguing that string theory never made good on its promise to deliver testable predictions. You cant have a testable prediction if the theorys unfalsifiable.
 
Falsifiability is one of the arguments that were used to show that Marxism and Freudian psychoanalysis are pseudoscience and not science. Both claimed to be scienctific, both convinced many people (including real scientists). Popper, whom you glibly and absurdly condemn as an enemy of science, was the first to realise that psychoanalysis was flexible enough to explain any behaviour whatsoever, and therefore didnt really explain anything. Marxism as a real economic theory could be and was falsified, but as actually practiced by Marxists it was unfalsifiable.

This is ludicrous. Is Islam more scientific than computing science? And what about Chemistry and Christianity? Neither of them have science in the name. Do we thus conclude that their status is equal? If Physics was renamed Phyiscal Science tomorrow would it lose its scientificness? If Scientology became Hubbardology would it increase in scientificness?
 
The reason why older sciences like Physics do not have the word science in their name is simple - when they were born, centuries ago, the notion of science had not yet been clearly articulated (Indeed the more modern meaning of the word science dates back to only the early 17th century).
 
The name computing science is appropriate as the word computing denotes an awful lot of activities not all of which can be described as scientific.
 
Whether or not a field is scientific can be determined only by the nature of its activity and not simply by its name.

Falsifiability is a necessary but by no means sufficient condition for something to be scientific. It seems to me that it is not only a question of whether a field states falsifiable proposition that makes it a science. It also depends on whether someone actually bothers to falsify these propositions which is probably not the case for astrology.
 
And I dont get your point about scientists using whatever methods will get them to the truth at all. If the method is such that you will not be able to tell truth from falsehood, then what good does it do you?

For a similar article that makes a run at double blind experiments and how testing takes place nowadays and has more compelling and coherent points to make, read this article.  However, while that article also tries to drive in a similar direction, Im not sure he ever gets there.  Yes, there are huge problems with the way many experiments are done, but hes largely arguing that double-blind experiments are not executed well, rather than arguing against the concept.  I think theres scope for other types of scientific experiments that take into account the ethical problems that human experiments can have.  For example, once double-blind experiments are done and something has been released to the public, why arent all uses of the drug tracked and any adverse affects immediately noted?  Why did more than 25,000 people have to have heart attacks before the drug Vioxx was finally pulled?
 
Your attack on falsifiability is ridiculous, Aaron.  As Eric points out, astrology is actually not falsifiable most of the time because the predictions are designed to be vague, Something good will happen to you this week.  And what does it matter if the number chosen for statistics is 5%?  Its like arguing that there should be no blood alcohol limit for drunk drivers because 0.08 is an arbitrary number.  If you have a case for it being higher or lower or would like to use better statistical methods, fine, make your point.  But to use anecdotal evidence of one person who has a problem and to point to genuinely murky scientific results like animal tests (animal tests sometimes predict what happens to humans and sometimes dont) is not much of an argument.  Double blind tests are the best methods we have come up with to tell when something is working or when it isnt.  When you argue against them, YOU are in fact arguing against science and rationality, especially if your only argument is that 5% is an arbitrary cutoff.
 
I do agree with you that these double blind experiments may be misused if people say that they prove that Benedictin doesnt cause birth defects.  However, they are right about a weaker but still relevant point: the experiments do show that we do not know what caused the problems and it is unlikely that it was this drug (assuming they ran their experiments properly, as detailed in the first link).
 
Finally, I agree that econometrics has many problems, though I havent looked into the matter very deeply.  However, the same econometric mathematical models are used by the global warming crowd to reach their doomsday predictions (links: 
1, 
2, 
3).  Still skeptical about econometrics?

And can you think of anything useful that falsifiability does?
 
Absolutely, it directs people to work towards areas that yield real scientific progress, where we can test models against reality, rather than complete speculation.  Its the reason that many may have wasted their lives (from a scientific perspective) if string theory doesnt pan out.  There are certainly legitimate reasons to create non-falsifiable claims, and discuss non-falsifiable issues, but they are not scientific claims/issues at that point.

String theorists do know theyre not doing science in the full sense. They know their theory isnt falsifiableit doesnt make ANY predictions about reality that can be observed! That puts it closer to the unfortunate class that Intelligent Design is in. However, two things may set String Theory apart: the fact that some of the brightest minds on the planet are working on it, and that it does predict some things that may one day be testable/observable, but we dont have the technology to be able to test them yet.

Aaron, in case you didnt know, string theory is considered controversial for precisely the reasons that Jacob lays out.  In fact, as Scott points out, the theorists would probably be the first to admit that theyre not actually doing science, just scouting out the possible solution space for likely answers.  The scientific method will then involve testing these hypotheses to see what holds true.  Instead of finding out more about this or asking questions, all you offer is ridicule, which is especially jarring considering your ignorance of this subject.

I do think its ridiculous that Jacob presumes to tell prominent physicists how to spend their time.
 
Vague predictions are falsifiable; theyre just less likely to be wrong. And my argument isnt that 5% is too high or too low, its that its arbitrary. If a study works only at 6% should we sentence people to death because were missing the other 1%. (Actually, what really happens is that people fake the data to get it over the hump, as a recent paper proved.) Evidence doesnt have clean lines between true and false; we depend on the situation to decide how strong our standards should be.

Jacob didnt tell anybody how to spend their time.  He pointed out the common criticism that string theory might turn out to be a complete waste of time because they have yet to make predictions that are testable.
 
Vague predictions are falsifiable; theyre just less likely to be wrong.
 
It depends on who youre trying to prove it to.  Scientists and intelligent laymen know that astrology is falsifiable and that it mostly comes out wrong.  However, the kind of people who believe in astrology are willing to seize on anything that might fit the prediction.  Something good will happen to you this week = Monday was a bright and sunny day.  Since you said falsifiability isnt much help, we took it for granted you were talking about these dim people.  For them, it is unfalsifiable because they are willing to make their definitions so broad as to be meaningless.

5% is not an arbitrary cutoff if comparison of many studies has shown it to be a good cutoff between studies that show repeatable results and those that dont.  Im guessing thats how it was arrived at.  You setup a false situation by assuming that a whole bunch of studies cluster around that number and that any of them over 5% are then tossed away as a result.  There are very likely few studies that even get close to that threshold.  Besides, I doubt that doctors actually use a hard threshold like that.  What you seem to be primarily talking about is a legal threshold, which seems to be required by the way the law works.  I agree with you that if doctors are actually using a hard theshold like that, it doesnt make much sense, but I doubt that they do.
 
Whos arguing against double-blind tests? All Im saying is that other stuff is evidence too.
 
Presumably you want to use other tests because you see some weakness or failing in double-blind tests that you would like to address.  And you did say, Behind evidence-based science are a bunch of very bizarre claims about what science is and isnt, which combined with your attack on falsifiability would appear to be an attack on the method theyre advocating.  And Im not (and I dont think the others are) saying that there arent any problems with that way things are done.  I previously pointed out that more effective follow-up studies should be done.  What were doing is pointing out that your particular criticisms dont hold much water.  Falsifiability is a necessary condition for science, animal tests arent that helpful, anecdotal examples are not useful on their own, and case studies can be problematic.
 
An economist doesnt believe global warmingso I should like economics more? Please.
 
Perhaps you didnt read those posts properly, let me summarize.  He is a former economist who points out that econometrics has failed miserably at what it was devised for, macroeconomics.  He then goes on to point out that the same type of models, that you have claimed skepticism about, are used to make the dire predictions coming from the global warming crowd.  Do you see how this points out a contradiction for you?

Ajay now insists that theories can be true or not true depending on who reads them, that because so many people use the number 5 it simply must have been chosen through studies (although he hasnt seen any), and that because economics once was wrong its a contradiction to believe that environmental studies are now right. I think Ajay should refrain from posting again until he learns basic principles of logic and evidence.

  No, what I said was that different people have different standards of evidence.  The reason we call them theories and not laws is because new evidence may always come up that could overturn what we believe.  Many people have very low standards of evidence; that is why they believe in astrology.

  No, I said that as long as it was only used as a legal standard, its probably okay.  Its true that I didnt cite any studies, but then neither did you.  Am I to be held to a higher standard?
 
because economics once was wrong its a contradiction to believe that environmental studies are now right.
  Since you took the time to define econometrics above, you obviously know the difference between the two and that your conflation of the two is a misrepresentation of what Im saying (your lies are Cheney-esque).  Whos talking about environmental studies?  Were talking about econometric models that purport to forecast future  global warming based on current trends.
 
In your comments over the last several months, you repeatedly make bizarre statements or seize on irrelevant, minor points.  Arguing with you is like arguing with a child, a style of discourse that Jon Stewart ripped in his famous Crossfire episode (though to be fair to you, those guys choose even more trivial points and only speak in repeated bromides).

Dear Aharon, When I was at Faculty, I always thought Poppers claims on falsifiability were bogus. The proper term must be testability although many aspects of nature are not testable because we lack adequate techniques to test them. However, those unverifiable aspects of nature can be deduced from careful and repeatable or attainable observations. Mathematics has many times helped us with solutions and explanations to several observed natural events, but it is spot on also that mathematics is a formal science (created by the human mind) that most times is not compatible with reality. For example, through equations theoreticians can deduce the existence of parallel universes, strings, branes, living bubbles, etc.; but those things do not exist in real nature and, if existed, they are not observable, so it is trivial even to consider it as knowledge. Science is a set of knowledge about the Universe ordered and systematized by means of observation, analysis and experimentation, which permits the deduction of principles (theories) and general laws.

While the M-theory (based upon so much frustrating work with different models of the string theory) cannot be considered true science because of the falsifiability aspect, it is highly improbable that future falsifiable theories that will emerge will be entirely different from it. There are too many happy coincidences in this approach to be just junk! An educated guess will say that at least chunks of it will be part of any new theory!
In fact many alternative explanations are falsifiable and have been eliminated. I think this is a totally new domain of the human knowledge that does not have yet a name (a label), but it is the closest you can get to science. It is science de jure if not de facto.

Title: I Hate the News
 
Some people start their day by reading The New York Times. Others end it by watching the nightly news. Some get it from The Daily Show. Others download it from a variety weblogs. Some keep up-to-the-minute by following CNN. Others have instant news updates automatically text messaged to their phone. But everybody seems to agree: its a citizens responsibility to keep up with the news. Everybody except me.
 
I think following the news is a waste of time.
 
Some people agree with me on a small scale. Some point out that the cable channels are obsessed with bizarre crimes that have little larger impact, that they worry too much about horse-race coverage of politics, that too much of the news is filled with PR-inserted nonsense. But they do this because they think these are aberrations; that underneath all this, the news is worth saving. I simply go one step further: I think none of it is worthwhile.
 
Let us look at the front page of todays New York Times, the gold standard in news. In the top spot there is a story about Republicans feuding among themselves. There is a photo of soldiers in Iraq. A stock exchange chief must return $100M. There is a concern about some doctors over-selling a nerve testing system. There is a threat from China against North Korea. There is a report that violence in Iraq is rising. And there is concern about virtual science classes replacing real ones.
 
None of these stories have relevance to my life. Reading them may be enjoyable, but its an enjoyable waste of time. They will have no impact on my actions one way or another.
 
Most people will usually generally concede this point, but suggest that theres something virtuous about knowing it anyway, that it makes me a better citizen. They point out that newspapers are a key part of our democracy, that by exposing wrong-doing to the people, they force the wrong-doers to stop.
 
This seems to be true, but the curious thing is that Im never involved. The government commits a crime, the New York Times prints it on the front page, the people on the cable chat shows foam at the mouth about it, the government apologizes and commits the crime more subtly. Its a valuable system  I certainly support the government being more subtle about committing crimes (well, for the sake of argument, at least)  but you notice how it never involves me? It seems like the whole thing would work just as well even if nobody ever read the Times or watched the cable chat shows. Its a closed system.
 
There is voting, of course, but to become an informed voter all one needs to do is read a short guide about the candidates and issues before the election. Theres no need to have to suffer through the daily back-and-forth of allegations and counter-allegations, of scurrilous lies and their refutations. Indeed, reading a voters guide is much better: theres no recency bias (where you only remember the crimes reported in the past couple months), you get to hear both sides of the story after the investigation has died down, you can actually think about the issues instead of worrying about the politics.
 
Others say that sure, most of the stuff in the news isnt of use, but occasionally youll come across some story that will lead you to actually change what youve been working on. But really, how plausible is this? Most peoples major life changes dont come from reading an article in the newspaper; they come from reading longer-form essays or thoughtful books, which are much more convincing and detailed.
 
Which brings me to my second example of people agreeing with me on the small scale. Youll often hear TV critics say that CNNs up-to-the-minute reporting is absurd. Instead of saying, We have unconfirmed reports thatThis just in! We now have confirmed reports that those unconfirmed reports have been denied. No, wait! Theres a new report denying the confirmation of the denial of the unconfirmed report. and giving viewers whiplash, they suggest that the reporters simply wait until a story is confirmed before reporting it and do commentary in the meantime.
 
But if thats true on a scale of minutes, why longer? Instead of watching hourly updates, why not read a daily paper? Instead of reading the back and forth of a daily, why not read a weekly review? Instead of a weekly review, why not read a monthly magazine? Instead of a monthly magazine, why not read an annual book?
 
With the time people waste reading a newspaper every day, they could have read an entire book about most subjects covered and thereby learned about it with far more detail and far more impact than the daily doses they get dribbled out by the paper. But people, of course, wouldnt read a book about most subjects covered in the paper, because most of them are simply irrelevant.
 
But finally, Id like to argue that following the news isnt just a waste of time, its actively unhealthy. Edward Tufte notes that when he used to read the New York Times in the morning, it scrambled his brain with so many different topics that he couldnt get any real intellectual work done the rest of the day.
 
The newss obsession with having a little bit of information on a wide variety of subjects means that it actually gets most of those subjects wrong. (One need only read the blatant errors reported in the corrections page to get some sense of the more thorough-going errors that must lie beneath them. And, indeed, anyone who has ever been in the news will tell you that the news always gets the story wrong.) Its obsession with the criminal and the deviant makes us less trusting people. Its obsession with the hurry of the day-to-day makes us less reflective thinkers. Its obsession with surfaces makes us shallow.
 
This is not simply an essay meant to provoke; I genuinely believe what I write. I have not followed the news at least since I was 13 (with occasional lapses on particular topics). My life does not seem to be impoverished for it; indeed, I think it has been greatly enhanced. But I havent found many other people who are willing to take the plunge.

Id distinguish whats relevant from whats interesting. E.g., a local zoning board dispute is more relevant to me than interesting.  Youre still interested in matters that are only marginally relevant to you. Youre just widening your sample as a noise filter, and it just becomes a matter of finding the optimum time period.  So if journalism is the first draft of history, maybe we should wait for the second draft, huh?

Wow, this post plays to so many of my own prejudices about the news, I almost want to disqualify myself from commenting! LOL Anyway, I have a challenge Ive posted to friends and strangers over the past 25 years, and I have yet to have a winner.  Here it is: if you, personally (first-hand knowledge only!) have been involved in a situation that was reported in the newspaper, did they get it correct, 100 percent? Every name spelled correctly?  The numbers right? The very simplest of details that would have been easy to check and verify?  Because of the several hundred (admittedly small sample) Ive asked, no one has answered in the affirmative.  From the smallest local story to the national ones.  I just think thats bizarre, and I dont understand it, knowing how obsessive some reporters and writers can be about details.  Any explanations?

@Reg Aubry:
 
Consider how unreliable eyewitness testimony is. People who witness crimes often have very different accounts of what happened  not just trivia like whether the assailant was wearing green-on-red plaid or red-on-green plaid, but how many people were involved, the sequence of events, the skin color and other obvious physical characteristics of the people involved, etc.
 
Whats my point? The news is made by people who rely on other people and their memories and explanations of what happened.
 
And that is not even considering the intentional dishonesty of parties involved in the events.

None of these stories have relevance to my life. 
  Reading them may be enjoyable, but its an 
  enjoyable waste of time. They will have no impact 
  on my actions one way or another.
 
Youre basically arguing against Chomsky and denying the influence of media on public opinion. This is very interesting for several reasons, one would be that youve just found out that spending money in political campaigns is a waste - though somehow this goes against every piece of study done in that field; OK, maybe it is in fact only the bumpersticker and the flag that make difference, not the news-media.
 
But seriously: I think you are arguing, that it doesnt make any sense for YOU to read the news, because you already made up your mind on all the things youre going to do. You know who youre voting for, you know that youll not be taking part in any revolutions toppling the government, you know already what you want to believe about the policies of certain politicians, or parties. In such a case of course it doesnt help to read the news. Neither for you, nor for followers of the Bush cult, or religious nuts etc. (forgive me for juxtaposing you with those groups; I know that unlike them you are from the reality-based community and will change your perceptions in accordance with reality).
 
However the conclusion that it is unnecessary for you, does not mean it is unnecesary for everybody. I agree that watching the news daily is more for entertainment, but I think getting a weekly overview over what is happening is important, for the same reason for not letting all tax-related stuff pile up until shortly before the deadlines; its easier to get done, it feels less like a chore). And yes, due to things I have read in the news, I have actualy taken action, like taking part in demonstrations for/against certain ideas/concepts/policies. Its not like there is a dichotomy between reading long essays/books and reading newspapers. There is in fact a) some overlap and b) plenty of reason to do both, because I do not beforehand what topics I want (or should be) reading long books/essays on.
 
But if thats true on a scale of minutes, why 
  longer? Instead of watching hourly updates, why 
  not read a daily paper? Instead of reading the 
  back and forth of a daily, why not read a weekly
   review? Instead of a weekly review, why not 
  read a monthly magazine? Instead of a monthly 
  magazine, why not read an annual book?
 
Thats a very poor argument, in fact its not an argument its a slippery slope fallacy. And I am surprised that youd stoop so low. Here see how much sense it makes:
If having sex every minute of your life is not a good way to live your life and might lead to harmful side-effects, then why would it be a good idea to have sex once a day? or once a week? Or once a year or once in your life? If having sex every minute in your life is bad, then surely having sex even once in your life is bad as well. Remeber: If the glove doesnt fit, you must acquit.
Doesnt make much sense, does it
 
The newss obsession with having a little bit of
  information on a wide variety of subjects means 
  that it actually gets most of those subjects 
  wrong.
 
This seems similar to one of the commenters saying:
 
that was reported in the newspaper, did they get
  it correct, 100 percent?
 
Its probably true that often things are not 100% correct. Its also true that of the many decision that I face as a human every day not all are 100% correct, yet I somehow manage to get by and even think of my life as being somewhat decent. Could it be that the same goes for newspapers? That while they may not be 100%correct  on any subject, that they manage to be decent enough to be useful for the people readin them? Sure, Id prefer to have an oracle that is 100% correct; but I sure as hell would not pay the price for that with respect to news. You probably know the difference of cost between a datacenter that guarantuees 99% availability, and the one that offers 99,999% availability (the costs explode). For my purposes the former has been decent enough, thank you. As a politician making crucial decision about life or death, you certainl want higher precision, and they do in fact pay a lot more for their reports and intelligence, than what I pay for a newspaper. In any case: Are you honestly suggesting that the simple and obvious fact that a newspaper is not an oracle makes them useless?
 
Its a valuable system  I certainly support 
  the government being more subtle about 
  committing crimes (well, for the sake of 
  argument, at least)  but you notice how it 
  never involves me? It seems like the whole thing
   would work just as well even if nobody ever 
  read the Times or watched the cable chat shows. 
  Its a closed system.
 
You can say the same thing about voting in a represantative democracy. Surely one singe vote is not going to make a difference. And even if only the people voted that actually hold office, and the rest of the population wouldnt, it wouldnt make a difference, would it? Legitimacy, Schmeticimacy, thats not important. After all its only the brand that counts, right? If  somebody bought the Times and never published something to the pubic, and only made their claims to the officials in government, it would keep on working the same way. Much like when dictators claim they live and rule in a democracy and have free press, and freedom for the people, then that makes it true, at least as long as they bought the true democracy brand, like Iraq is currently doing. Certainly it doesnt involve any of the actual people living there to do or say anything.
 
The reason that the closed system works, is because there is some legitimacy in it. That legitimacy is gone when people stop participating in it. For a newspaper participation comes from the readers it is reaching, and for a democracy it is the people voting. Claiming that its a closed system and works the same way when you take away the people is absurd.
 
What you can claim is that taking away one person is not going to make the system collapse. In game theory I believe this is called the free riders dilemma. Surely the country is not going down the drain, when one person is not paying his taxes. Surely public transit is not going bankrupt, if I decide not pay today. etc. etc.
 
Most peoples major life changes dont come from
  reading an article in the newspaper; they come 
  from reading longer-form essays or thoughtful 
  books, which are much more convincing and 
  detailed.
 
What does that say about your weblog?
 
I think what you are really trying to say, is that the act of delivering and the act of absorbing a list of facts about lots of unrelated little stories is not helpful. Thats true for a certain kind of journalism (in quotes) that feeds on the same instinct that makes peope slow down and look at accident-scenes. Thats indeed little helpful. But to reduce news, newspapers or the media to just that is dismissing the reality of the world we live in.

Reading the news may, and probably does, make you a better citizen. But so what? I dont want to be a (good) citizen, i.e. an (obedient) subject of a state. As the saying goes, the only nation worth paying any allegiance to, is imagination.
 
With regard to the news themselves, I just scan the headlines (RSS) to see whats going on, and it wont waste many minutes of my time a day. Thats usually quite enough to infer the content, most of which is totally uninteresting. Occasionally theres a more interesting story worth reading, but only very occasionally.
 
One could actually almost survive on free newspapers here, as every few months some newspaper tries to lure you to order it, by offering it for free for a month or two. Some years ago I once took the free newspaper, but all I got was fed up with hauling the papers to the paper recycling bin, so I havent accepted any newspaper offers, free or otherwise, since then.

I own a television, but it is literally wrapped up in a wooden box which has a lock on it, and for good reason. I also gave up on the news after a brief stint in the wake of 9-11 when every military anything had a TV tuned to CNN non-stop: having taken news consumption to its limit, and having a job, simultaneously, to find information, it became painfully clear that the news, and television in general, was a waste of time. I rely on friends and blogs to keep me informed of current events and I spend my news time searching out other viewpoints. With those provisios, let me tack on to Anonymous about this:

Do you vote?
Are your choices when voting influenced by what you read in the news?
 
If so it is no longer a closed system and you are involved. The reason that the government reacts when the cable channels, etc froth at the mouth is that they are concerned that that votes are at stake. If no one ever read the papers, or watched the news, then the motivation for the goverment to commit crimes more subtly would not exist. It is not a closed system, but it can feel that way, as the actions of voters are only significant when viewed in large blocks.
 
I would agree that following the news on an hourly, or daily basis is a waste of time for the average person, but when the time comes to vote for a representative , knowledge of how they have performed in the past is valuable.

Aaron, when considering a voter guide , then our opinions are much closer. The sad fact is that (over here in Ireland at least) voter guides are few and far between. On top of that where does the voter guide come from? Who compiled it? What are their biases? Now I need a voter guide guide to boot. Its a nice scenario , but impractical.
 
In the abscence of reliable, unbiased guides, the news is my only source of information. That said I agree that keeping up regularly is uneccessary. I use the large variety of news sources to help control the biases. I buy a paper perhaps once every 2 weeks, and watch television news with roughly the same frequency. If I find an issue of particular concern on one of these rare dips into the news stream that might result in a period of more intense attention than normal. If a serious national/european issue arises, It will become impossible to miss. And if something more specialist arises It will do doubt be raised in one of the many blogs on topics of interest that I subscribe.
 
For example when the EUCD started reared its ugly head that resulted in me paying particular attention to all news outlets that might carry any information on the subject at all. And close to key voting dates my attention was indeed hourly. All the better to lobby my MEPs and combat any last minute PR by the opposing side.
 
But at the moment there is nothing particularly alarming happening that I wish to involve myself in, so its been weeks since I have watched TV news or read the papers.
 
I suppose this brings me to a second point. Why are you not involved? Why do you not contact your representatives? I will admit that the first time I did it I did not believe that it would actually accomplish anything, I almost viewed it as a symbolic protest, and with some representatives that was indeed the case. But in the majority of cases I was actually pleasantly suprised that the act of one voter calling, phoning or writing (email seems to be very ineffective) seemed to have a real impact.

Hi Aaron,
 
I enjoy your blog, and I love your honesty and disclosure. Really good.
 
Have you considered that because your opportunity-rich young life is at least partly a product of your countrys position in the world, you might have a responsibility to understand the cost externalities of this lifestyle? (In other words, to read good quality international news). Maybe ignorance is blissful self-indulgence?
 
Dont mean to sound patronising, and Im not trying to tell you what to do ;-) but its at least one argument in favour of reading the news, through whatever medium. On the other hand, personal experience suggests that this strategy does not tend to happiness, but hey!

All counts. Books(new and old), papers, tvs, documentaries, movies, what you see on the street. How you talk to your Chinese, Argentinian, and Lebanese friends - Iraqi landlords - or even Jewish contractors - how the 20th century was for their family and people - and how its going - etc.
 
Its harmful to think books are better than newspapers. For local and current issue, local papers and phone directory comes in handy, esp when things are not working that well in the local govts.
 
We all got basic intelligence to grasp how things are working in the world, problem is we havent sorted out the framework to design dashboard for each and all of us - as a driver and passenger - but we have all kind of meters and warning lights piling up almost at random in front of our eyes.
 
But base should be that we all got enough intelligence to grasp whats going on. The rest is like competition snotty kids having in classroom. Get it out. Its a pettiness over the privilege.

I know youre concerned and connected in a good way, and wasnt trying to imply otherwise :-)
 
Books are great, but they can only tell you what has happened, not what is about to happen. Also, in my experience, where books use secondary or tertiary sources to reconstruct events, they sometimes get it wrong just like the papers.
 
There are some great reporters out there who are writing great books page by page whilst covering events around the world, and without their primary materials based on sharing the experiences of real people, history books would be a lot more remote from real life.

While i hail your strategy for following the news as a wise choice, i would like to emphasize that it may not be the best strategy for all people at all times.  To say None of these stories have relevance to my life  They will have no impact on my actions one way or another is true (or not) by personal choice and not of necessity.  For the most part i have followed the same strategy as have you; and me thinks it has served me well  obsession with what passes for mainstream news these days is most certainly the waste of time of a obsessive voyeur.  Yet from time to time it is wise to adapt and change the focus of your attention.  If there is a fire in the house, you must watch out.  Me thinks that is actually the case we have in the world today.  The urgent matter, of course, being the Bush Doctrine.  That is a fire that must be extinguished.  Involvement in that political story with the objective of taking control of the US congress away form the administration is an urgent matter with which every right minded citizen of the United States should be concerned  or so me thinks.

Aaron, as I said, I use the large variety of news sources to help control the biases. While this isnt perfect, no source of information (no matter how hard the author may honestly try) is completely free of bias, the only reasonable solution to that is to try and get as many sides of the opinion as possible. For voter guides to become a practical solution to the problem , the number being increased  would have to increase dramatically.

Ill offer two counter-points:
 
1) Part of what makes news interesting is also what makes Lost and the Detroit Tigers interesting  its fun to talk about. That is, its conversationally fun to be aware of current events and develop hypotheses on their outcomes.
 
2) The book version of news seems to miss the point. News is a process, a narrative  not a finished complete product. Thats what makes it fun.

Theres a difference between News, information, and the Media. I have been cut off from the news for a year now since giving up TV. I was never  fond of newspapers, and I was generally tired of what was out there. My half full glass was emptied everytime I started reading or listening. The only thing I may regret about the experience is my inability to compete at Trivia Pursuit in a couple years.

More news, not less. More sources, not less. More choice, not less. More often, not less. Youre either open or closed, dynamic or static, moving or still. Alive or dead.
 
News is not about citizenship, its about survival.

Hi Aaron,
 
You asked when do you care about what is just about to happen?
 
Well, sometimes you do. If you retro-analyse attacks on civil liberties or other changes that can impact on our lives, you can probably find a pattern of signals in prior coverage. If you live in Iran, you presumably read the evil empires statements about Iranian nuclear technology very closely, as they could mean the difference between living a normal life and being bombed back to the stone age. There are many more examples I can think of, some too personal to relate here, where a better news radar could have saved peoples lives if they knew when to get out of a particular place or situation.
 
Also, perhaps when you have expended your entrepreneurial energies inventing things and starting companies, you might end up holding stock in the companies that buy your ventures ;-) In that case, you may want to track the news to find out what is about to happen.
 
Anyway - its all RSS these days. Just write an early warning algorithm based on text analysis and get a nabaztag bunny to notify you when to pack your bags and get the hell out of Dodge ;-)

Great article! Ive written something similar a few months ago (in my native, non-english language), was published and got similar responses as you. It seems people defend their daily news habit as if it was sacred. ;)

The unexamined life is not worth living.  Examination shows that conventional news isnt worthwhile.  So throw it out.  I dont understand whats the big deal with this, I guess I throw out lots of things like news and it doesnt seem particularly remarkable, it seems quite normal.  Is the point here to produce a diff list of what people who examine their lives do differently from what people who dont examine their lives do?  (Although arguably even people who dont examine their lives probably do examine their lives and are happy with them!)  In any case, that diff list would be a pretty cool list, Id like to see that.

Miscellaneous list of other things to reject: Mocking the right brain, doing pretty much anything our culture implores such as worshiping individuals, working, acting rationally, pretending to support something and then acting contrarily (for example, people pretend to support community and then buy books, movies, software, etc), pretending that the public is idiotic while contributing nothing other than deploring the publics idiocy and endlessly discussing events which one considers idiotic, leaving no exit from idiocy, acting as a type, dishonesty, quoting or repeating things ad verbatim rather than thinking for oneself, discouraging others from thinking or creating of themselves by being excessively critical and holding all works to the same standard, discouraging others from experimenting even in ways that appear to be stupid.  These are all just based on what Noam Chomsky called the minimal plausible rule of ethics, the rule of the Gospels: do unto others as you would have others do unto you.  Of course one could go further if one was inclined.  And Im not saying that any of these are necessary, theyre just things that I tend to do because I feel uncomfortable when Im excessively hypocritical.

I agree with everything you said. I hate when all my family can talk about at the dinner table is the shit they read in the newspaper today or heard on CNN. I just want to yell out, Why do you give a shit? How does it effect you? How is it relevant to your life?
 
Earlier this year during the dreadful, nonstop coverage of the rebellions in the middle east, my class was having a long, drawn out discussion on the topic. I couldnt take it anymore so I raised my hand and said, excuse me, but why do you guys care so much about this? how does it effect your lives in any way? If you didnt hear about it on the radio or watch it on TV, you wouldnt even know it was happening, and it would have the same effect on your life: absolutely none whatsoever. Of course, I was attacked by everyone in the classroom and was basically labeled an uncaring, heartless ignoramus.
 
Such is the way of the world
